    "full_text": "Productivity of sugarcane ( Saccharum spp.) relies upon sucrose production in leaves and movement to sinks. The feedback regulatory effect of sugar upon photosynthesis balances this process involving Phospho enol pyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) and Rubisco where greater understanding in this area may allow manipulation to achieve higher yields. Accumulation of sucrose in leaves and decreased photosynthesis are early symptoms of the condition called yellow canopy syndrome (YCS) in sugarcane, which presents as a system in which to study sucrose feedback regulation. This work investigates changes in gene expression and protein abundance which coincide with the sugar accumulation in the leaves of YCS symptomatic sugarcane. During the early-stage of sugar accumulation, the levels of the Photosystem II core protein D1, and PsbQ of the oxygen-evolving complex decreased significantly. Transcript levels of these proteins also decreased, suggesting both nuclear and chloroplast gene expression were affected early in sugar build-up of YCS development. Transcript level of primary carbon fixation reactions enzyme NADP malate dehydrogenase was especially downregulated. However, PEPCase, decarboxylation and re-fixation (Rubisco) enzymes were not negatively regulated at the transcript or protein abundance level. Phospho enol pyruvate carboxykinase was upregulated in both gene expression and protein abundance. The Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath was sensitive through the CP12 protein. Two isoforms of CP12 were found, one of which showed downregulation which coincided with a decrease in CP12 protein. This suggests transcript and protein decrease of PEPCase and Rubisco may be secondary regulation points of the sugar feedback regulation process upon photosynthesis in sugarcane leaves."

          "The productivity of crops in general relies upon the production of sucrose and its movement to storage sink tissues. The regulation of this process, which includes sucrose feedback inhibition on photosynthesis, is an area in which understanding can potentially lead to crop yield improvement.",
          "Sugarcane is a fast growing tropical C4 grass and a major crop worldwide. Its yield is determined by sucrose transport to the culm tissue for storage or biomass production. A constant radiation use efficiency (RUE) in sugarcane crops is not achieved throughout the full crop cycle. The distinct uncoupling of the linear relationship between cumulative intercepted radiation and biomass accumulation is known as the reduced growth phenomenon (RGP) (for review van Heerden et al., 2010 ). The physiological basis for the RGP is still poorly understood but is likely to be, at least in part, associated with feedback regulation of leaf photosynthesis.",
          "The process of photosynthesis, from the point of fixation through to sucrose synthesis goes through multiple control steps. This includes the capturing of light in the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) chain, initial CO 2 fixation in the mesophyll (M), decarboxylation in the bundle sheath (BS), re-fixation of CO 2 by Rubisco in the BS, Calvin cycle activity, and the partitioning of triose phosphate (TP). Generally, the majority of TP in a source leaf BS cell chloroplast is exported to the cytosol/symplast for the production of sucrose. If the synthesis of sucrose exceeds export, as occurs during the greatest photosynthetic activity hours of the day, TP is repartitioned to make starch in the BS chloroplast (in sugarcane). This serves to provide energy for dark reactions during the night through starch breakdown products.",
          "If sucrose production exceeds demand, accumulation leads to a feedback inhibitory effect that is well characterised. Much of this regulation is to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photo-oxidation, which may occur when there is insufficient reduced coenzyme regeneration ( Schottler and Toth 2014 ; and references therein). This regulation takes place through redox state signalling of PET in various forms, and subsequently photosynthetic control ( Foyer et al., 2012 ). The term photosynthetic control encompasses signalling pathways which ensure ATP and NADPH production by PET and their use in metabolism is coordinated in the short-term and long-term ( Foyer et al., 2012 ). This involves retrograde signalling (plastid to nucleus) and photosynthesis-related gene expression suppression.",
          "Leaf sugar accumulation in higher plants leads to the downregulation of a number of photosynthetic genes ( Stitt et al., 2010 ). Similar downregulation of metabolism occurs in mutants of the C4 plant maize ( Zea mays ) which are defective in phloem loading, resulting in sugar build up in the lamina ( Slewinski et al., 2009 ). A reduction in sink strength also leads to reduced photosynthetic leaf metabolism in sugarcane ( McCormick et al. 2008a , 2008b , 2009 ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ), mediated through a feedback regulation mechanism ( McCormick et al., 2008b ).",
          "Control points of photosynthesis feedback regulation by sugars in sugarcane leaves involves the decrease of carbon fixation enzyme activities and abundances, i.e. downregulation of Rubisco (EC 4.1.1.39) and phospho enol pyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase; EC 4.1.1.31) protein and protein activities ( Lobo et al., 2015 ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). Ribeiro et al. (2017) shows both Rubisco and PEPCase carboxylation capacities are reduced in vivo when sugarcane leaves are sprayed with a sucrose solution. However, photosynthesis-related gene expression changes associated with leaf sucrose accumulation in sugarcane have not been specifically investigated. It is known the gene expression of Rubisco subunits and some Calvin cycle enzymes are influenced by sugars ( McCormick et al., 2008a ; Paul and Pellny 2003 ; Smith and Stitt 2007 ).",
          "Yellow canopy syndrome (YCS) of sugarcane provides a unique approach in which to investigate the effect of sucrose accumulation, and its feedback regulatory effect, upon sugarcane leaf metabolism. Its onset coincides with excessive sugar build-up in the leaves in which the greatest accumulation of sucrose occurs in the midrib as a result of decreased export from the leaf ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ). The cause of decreased sucrose export is considered to be a physiological disorder triggered by general plant stress ( Botha 2019 ), it has not been linked to specific abiotic or biotic factors, nor nutrient levels in soil or plant. YCS is a condition affecting sugarcane grown for sucrose yield commercially in Australia.",
          "Previous work shows a build-up of sucrose in YCS-affected leaves leads to the downregulation of photosynthetic rate, decreased intercellular CO 2 and decreased stomatal conductance, all preceding visual symptoms of leaf yellowing ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ), consistent with a feedback regulation effect. Broad-scale gene expression changes in YCS leaves were investigated and showed these physiological effects were linked to differential expression largely in the areas of the thylakoid membrane and photosynthetic process ( Marquardt et al. 2017 , 2019 ). However, the specific pathways or key enzymes of photosynthesis have not been investigated.",
          "YCS can be exploited to study the effect of sugar feedback regulation upon sugarcane leaf metabolism. Sucrose, as well as hexose levels are found to be elevated in YCS-affected leaves, which presents as the initial symptom of the condition ( Marquardt et al. 2016 , 2017 ). Generally, studies of leaf sucrose accumulation require use of techniques such as cell suspension cultures, exogenous sucrose feeding, leaf section removal or plant defoliation ( Gonzali et al., 2006 ; Heinrichs et al., 2012 ; Lobo et al., 2015 ; McCormick et al., 2008a ; Muller et al., 2007 ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). This often leads to either non-physiological concentrations of sucrose or glucose introduction in the leaves, or a lack of their uptake into cells ( Van Dingenen et al., 2016 ). Stem girdling studies have investigated protein activity and abundance in sugarcane, however have not investigated gene expression changes ( McCormick et al., 2008b ).",
          "In this study we hypothesise the sugar accumulation in YCS-affected sugarcane leaves will coincide with regulatory changes in key components of photosynthesis, firstly involving PEPcase and Rubisco transcript and protein abundance. We predict this forms the initial sugar feedback regulation effect which precedes the development of yellowing symptoms in the leaves ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). We will further investigate the initial changes in transcript and protein abundance of some of the key components of photosynthesis: PSII, PSI and the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PET, other enzymes of the initial fixation and decarboxylation processes, and the Calvin cycle. This approach will further information regarding gene expression and protein changes in the different compartments (i.e. plastid and nucleus), and sensitivity differences between M and BS enzymes during sugar accumulation and photosynthetic feedback regulation in sugarcane leaves.",
          "In order to determine the early changes in photosynthetic gene expression and proteins, we generated datasets from leaf material in the early-stage (ES; pre-visual symptoms) and late-stage (LS; visually symptomatic) of sugar accumulation during YCS onset. The gene expression dataset is broadly investigated in a previous study by Marquardt et al. (2019) . In this study, specific photosynthetic pathways are investigated in combination with proteome data generated from the same sample tissue."

              "Control samples were collected from asymptomatic plants separated by more than 40 m from symptomatic plants. These were verified as control samples by checking for sugar accumulation through enzymatic methods, where sugar accumulation in the lamina is a characteristic of YCS ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). These samples where rationalised to be “true” controls as the definition of YCS onset is a characteristic yellowing of mid canopy leaves due to sugar accumulation ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ).",
              "To sample leaf lamina, firstly leaves on a plant displaying YCS symptoms were numbered starting from the top where the first visible dewlap represented leaf 1, as described by Bonnett (2013) . Leaves were numbered sequentially below (2, 3, etc). Samples were taken between 8 and 10am from leaf 6, from 21 YCS-symptomatic as well as 21 asymptomatic (control) culms from separate stools. Leaf 6 was collected as it consistently displayed the desired YCS symptoms and had both asymptomatic and symptomatic sections of lamina.",
              "In order to determine early changes taking place during YCS development, YCS-symptomatic leaves were selected with sections of lamina displaying both a) symptomatic yellowing colouration (LS; late-stage YCS (yellow in colour)) and, b) green colouration (ES; early-stage YCS (green in colour)). Therefore, ES and LS lamina samples were collected from the same YCS-symptomatic leaf. This allowed the separation of early and late metabolic changes. It is known from previous studies that once a portion of lamina on a leaf displays YCS symptoms, the remaining asymptomatic lamina will eventually become symptomatic and eventually senesce. Early changes (ES tissue) were therefore representative of the initial effects of YCS onset, without dilution of downstream effects associated with leaf yellowing (LS tissue), such as senescence.",
              "ES-YCS, LS-YCS and control samples were ground to a fine powder. The lamina powder from four separate leaves was bulked to create one replicate for four of the five replicates, and the fifth created from five bulked leaves (five replicates for each sample type, using a total of 21 leaves).",

The remaining powder was lyophilised using a freeze dryer (CHRIST ALPHA 1–4 LSC plus, Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Germany). From this, 30 mg lyophilised powder was used for proteome analysis."

During this stage, it is known photosynthetic rate, decreased intercellular CO 2 , and decreased stomatal conductance take place ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). The LS describes when sugars are elevated to a greater extent and visual symptoms of yellowing were present ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ). Metabolite data from the same sample material in previous work ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ) showed sucrose accumulation during YCS-onset was present in the ES (2.8-fold increase) and to a greater extent in the LS (5.5-fold increase) and both hexoses (glucose and fructose) were elevated to a greater extent than sucrose.

Twenty contigs matching PEPCase were found and two proteins. These PEPcase transcripts and protein were largely unaffected in the ES samples, however both were distinctly downregulated in the LS ( Fig. 1 A). This suggested PEPCase regulation, through transcript and/or protein abundance, was not an early response to sugar accumulation as part of YCS onset.",

In the reference transcriptome, 36 RbcL contigs were found, of which 10 had adequate mapping of sequence reads and were not compromised by the presence of other genes on the contig. However, only one RbcL transcript gene was expected. All ten were included in results which displayed >5 transcripts per million (TPM) from read-mappings. Six of the 10 RbcL genes showed a frameshift in the protein-coding region. Further, two of the 10 genes (which did not contain frameshifts) attracted the majority of the sequence reads and had control sample TPM values around 3000 each (TPM values found in Supplementary Table 4 , Additional File 1).

              "Six genes encoding CP12 in two distinct amino acid sequence groups were found in lamina tissues and named ShCP12-1 and ShCP12-2. Both groups contained the conserved key features of CP12 protein (N-terminal cysteine pair, a C-terminal cysteine pair, and core “AWD_VEE” sequence; Rodríguez-Celma et al., 2016 ). Basic amino acid alignment tree analysis indicated ShCP12-2 branched closely to CP12-1 and CP12-2 of Arabidopsis, allowing its categorisation as type I. While ShCP12-1 was branched separately, also with that of CP12-3 of Arabidopsis, a type II CP12. The proteome data contained matches for each sequence similarity group ( Table 1 ). The three gene sequences of ShCP12-1 showed greater general transcript numbers in control leaf lamina than the three of ShCP12-2 (TPM between 16 and 47, and TPM <4.5 in ShCP12-1 and ShCP12-2 , respectively; for values see Supplementary Table 5 , Additional File 1). All ShCP12-1 genes were downregulated in both the ES and LS tissue (to a greater extent in LS; Fig. 5 A). Its protein levels showed a decrease in all tissue with sugar accumulation compared to control lamina ( Fig. 5 A). Contrastingly, ShCP12-2 genes showed upregulation coinciding with sugar accumulation, especially in the LS. However, the matching protein remained similar to control tissue levels.",

GADB showed expression patter similar to that of ShCP12-1 (downregulated in the ES and LS) during sugar build-up in the leaves. Whereas GADA and GAPN showed downregulation in the LS only ( Fig. 5 B). On the protein level, no identified GAPDH or PRK protein levels displayed differential abundance from the control. It was noted that another plastidic GAPDH, which showed homology to GADCP1 of Arabidopsis, was upregulated in the LS. This was also mirrored as a protein abundance increase."

In this study, it was predicted this would be reflected on a biochemical level in PEPCase and Rubisco gene expression or protein levels as these are known to be early control points of sucrose-induced feedback regulation upon photosynthesis in sugarcane leaves ( Lobo et al., 2015 ; McCormick et al., 2008a ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ).",
          "PEPCase and Rubisco transcript and protein level decreases were not among the early changes associated with sucrose feedback regulation of photosynthesis in YCS-affected sugarcane leaves. The earliest changes were found in transcript and protein levels of the D1 protein of PSII, PsbQ of the OEC, Calvin cycle regulatory protein CP12-1, and in gene expression of NADPMD of the carboxylation process. As sugar accumulation occurred in the lamina, CP12-1 expression and protein level, as well as substrate data, indicated Calvin cycle activity was reduced. These changes all coincided with sugar build-up and preceded visual symptom development of leaf yellowing linked to chlorophyll loss. The strong correlation between changes in transcript and protein for the PSII component of D1, PsbQ of the OEC, and CP12-1 indicated their regulation is probably largely through transcriptional control. Intriguingly, Rubisco large subunit protein (RbcL) was found to increase in the ES of sugar accumulation of YCS onset in the lamina.",
          "Reduced initial carbon fixation in M cells was reflected in downregulation of particularly NADPMD gene expression; a redox regulated protein which functions closely with the malate valve of the chloroplast envelope. This early transcriptional downregulation was not shared by enzymes of the decarboxylation process or secondary carbon fixation (Rubisco) transcripts of the bundle sheath. The data are consistent with secondary carbon fixation in the bundle sheath being regulated by protein activity or substrate availability rather than through gene expression.",

              "Rubisco gene expression remained stable despite sugar accumulation leading to substantial PET gene expression changes. Rubisco catalyses what is considered to be the rate-limiting step of the Calvin cycle (carboxylation of Ribulose bisphosphate; RuBP), present only in the stroma of the chloroplasts in BS cells. Rubisco is known to decrease in activity and abundance as a result of exogenous sucrose-spraying in leaves of sugarcane ( Lobo et al., 2015 ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). Where the C3 pathway of carboxylation with Rubisco is regulated by leaf sucrose feedback mechanisms ( Lobo et al., 2015 ), in addition to the C4 pathway of PEPCase in M ( in vivo ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). However, Rubisco subunits and activase are differentially regulated where RbcL is chloroplast-encoded, requiring post-translational modifications such as ATP-consuming, chaperone-dependent folding ( Hauser et al., 2015 ; and references therein), and RbcS and activase (RbcA) are nuclear encoded. Although RbcL showed a trend (not significant) of decreased gene expression, which was not seen in RbcS and RbcA in the early stages of sugar build-up of YCS development, the RbcL protein showed greater abundance in the ES than in the control.",
              "From the literature, it is unexpected for any upregulation of RbcL to take place in tissues with decreased photosynthetic rate. Decreased photosynthetic rate occurs in the early stages of sugar accumulation and is found during YCS onset in the leaf ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). An observed rise in RbcL protein may be explained by a storage process, an example of which is found in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wherein RbcL is contained within granules during oxidative stress due to high light ( Uniacke and Zerges 2008 ). In wheat, leaf pieces exposed to continuous light without external CO 2 show accumulation of a fragment of Rubisco slightly smaller in size than RbcL ( Feller et al., 2008 ; Herrmann and Feller 1998 ; Thoenen et al., 2007 ). In order to understand more of the rise in RbcL protein in this study, same-area leaf sections could be analysed for protein abundance and activity. Regardless, it is considered unlikely the elevated RbcL protein level represented an increase of Calvin cycle activity as stomatal conductance and photosynthesis are reduced during sugar feedback regulation, which is also shown during sugar accumulation of YCS-affected lamina preceding visual symptom development. This implies decreased Calvin cycle activity due to lack of substrate and is further supported by an early reduction in malate in leaves with sugar accumulation during YCS onset, without a distinct rise in the alternative C4 carbon shuttle, aspartate ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ).",
              "Of importance to Rubisco function in leaves is its assembly and activity which are regulated post-transcriptionally in multiple ways, including the binding of activase, and activase cofactor presence. Although Rubisco is found to be a relatively stable enzyme once assembled (for Rubisco biogenesis and function review see Hauser et al., 2015 ), its activity is further influenced by the redox state of PET through ATP/ADP ratio and the presence of Pi in the chloroplast. Examples of where Rubisco gene expression and protein abundance are upregulated in sugarcane include in leaves with an elevated photosynthetic rate (via source-sink balance manipulation), where increased expression of RbcL , as well as RbcS and RbcA , occurs as a long term response (between 6 and 14 days; McCormick et al., 2008a ) and the Rubisco protein increases with partial shading of sugarcane leaves, with or without the addition of exogenous sucrose feeding have been found in some varieties ( Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). This shows regulation at both the gene expression and protein level as Rubisco is upregulated when sink demand is high. On the other hand, Rubisco activity is prone to inhibition by sugar phosphates ( Bhat et al., 2017 ) and is reduced during a wide range of abiotic stresses including high temperature (through CO 2 limitation) and water deficiency (through RbcA activity limitation; Perdomo et al., 2017 ). The data presented here indicate transcriptional control of Rubisco was not an early impact of sugar accumulation in the lamina. Nor was the decrease of Rubisco component protein levels. This difference to previously reported findings may be attributed to an effect of exogenous sucrose feeding experiments compared that of reduced phloem translocation leading to sucrose accumulation during YCS development. Determining Rubisco activity changes over time during sugar accumulation in the leaf may provide additionally clarification of the carboxylation activity of the BS cells."

This suggested both coarse-, as well as fine-control ( Foyer et al., 2012 ) of these processes as an early change during the sugar accumulation of YCS onset.",
              "The PSII D1 protein (PsbA) is chloroplast-encoded whereas the OEC components are nuclear-encoded, showing both compartments were signalled to regulate gene expression in the early-stage of sugar accumulation. Transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis-related genes is mediated through multiple pathways. Retrograde (plastid-to-nucleus) and anterograde (nucleus-to-plastid) signalling allows reactive expression changes triggered by one compartment, to affect gene expression in the other compartment (for review of retrograde signalling control of photosynthesis see Dietz et al., 2018 ). Wherein altered transcription of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs) may blanket-effect upwards of 50 chloroplasts (in M cells, often less in BS). It is possible retrograde signalling (chloroplast-to-nucleus) would trigger PhANG gene downregulation seen in the data during the early stages of sugar accumulation of YCS onset. For this to take place, sugar elevation would be expected to be present in the cytosol in the lamina (likely due to reduced phloem movement; Marquardt et al., 2019 ). Consistent with this is observed elevation of trehalose in the lamina ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ), where the precursor to trehalose, trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) is tightly linked to cellular sucrose levels ( Lunn et al., 2006 ; Yadav et al., 2014 ) and signals various regulatory effects as a result. How sucrose accumulation in leaf lamina impacts on various compartments and signalling is an area of strong research interest and may be beneficial in maximising crop yields through understanding and manipulation of photosynthesis feedback regulation of sugar ( O'Hara et al., 2013 ). Sucrose itself is present in the chloroplast in plants ( Gerrits et al., 2001 ). It was shown in mutant Arabidopsis seedlings with increased plastidic investase activity that sucrose presence represses PET chain function and PhANGs ( Tamoi et al., 2010 ). This indicates sucrose and its breakdown into hexoses in the chloroplast may be an important regulatory step during sucrose feedback regulation in cells. It is possible sucrose may be elevated in the chloroplasts during sugar feedback regulation of photosynthesis in YCS-affected leaf lamina."

This was not shared by BS–specific decarboxylation proteins of NADPME and re-fixation proteins of RbcS and RbcA (RbcL showed slight trend of decreased expression).

Of the proteins investigated, a close relationship between gene expression and protein abundance across the ES and LS was observed for PSII components, PSI components, ShPsbQ (OEC), PEPCase and CA (decarboxylation process), and CP12-1 (Calvin cycle). This suggests that gene expression is a fundamental control point in the regulation of these proteins, spanning both chloroplast and nuclear gene expression. Altogether, the data indicate that although M-enriched proteins of the major processes of initial carbon fixation show a stronger downregulation than those of the BS, both cell types show early reactions to sugar accumulation. It is possible M cells are functionally downregulated earlier than BS cells during sugar accumulation through the beginning of the senescence process.

The produced malate is shuttled out of M chloroplasts and into the BS chloroplast to be decarboxylated for use by Rubisco. This represents the major carbon shuttle in sugarcane C4 photosynthesis, the majority of the remaining flux is through aspartate ( Moore and Botha 2014 ). NADPMD is redox activity-regulated and functions in tandem with the malate valve on the chloroplast membrane. The malate valve exports malate from the chloroplast to the cytosol and plays an important role in balancing the chloroplast NADPH/ATP ratio ( Hameister et al., 2007 ; Scheibe 2004 ). NADPMD gene expression (nucleus-encoded) is known to be influenced under various conditions and NADPMD may be a crucial enzyme in the photosynthetic control response of the nucleus to sugar accumulation in the lamina during sugar feedback regulation during YCS onset."

Alternative decarboxylation pathways are important for plasticity of photosynthesis during changing environmental conditions ( Sales et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2014 ). The PEPCK decarboxylation pathway is found to be more efficient as it uses less quanta per CO 2 molecule fixed than the NADPME pathway ( Furbank 2011 ). In C3 PEPCK decarboxylation plant types, PEPCK is also known to localise to the phloem ( Chen, 2004 ). It is possible the observed upregulation during sugar accumulation of YCS onset may not be representative of changes in M or BS carbon shuttling for photosynthesis but rather due to phloem metabolism perturbances. Further investigation in this area may be of use for linking sucrose and its downstream metabolic effects."

One such case is the A 2 B 2 GAPDH B-type subunit ( Marri et al., 2014 ; Scheibe et al., 2002 ; Sparla et al., 2002 ).

              "It was found sucrose accumulation did not coincide with Rubisco protein abundance or transcript decrease in lamina, despite clear feedback regulation upon photosynthesis being in effect. However, it is known sugar inhibits sugarcane photosynthesis through downregulation of Rubisco synthesis and activity ( Lobo et al., 2015 ). Here we suggest photosynthesis downregulation was not initially attributed to Rubisco subunit gene expression or protein abundances, rather, may be a result of activity state through assembly and/or substrate availability. Worth noting is during exogenous sucrose feeding experiments by Lobo et al. (2015) , PSII activity is decreased, however maximum quantum yield (i.e. number of capable PSII units) was unaffected which implies a downregulation of PSII components was not taking place. Sugar accumulation in YCS-affected leaves displays delta K peak in dark-adapted fluorescence readings, indicating a decrease in functional PSII units ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). This suggests a difference in effect between sucrose-spraying induced feedback regulation (wherein sucrose levels are not elevated but hexoses are; Lobo et al., 2015 ), and sugar accumulation taking place during YCS onset. However, it is important to reiterate the initial cause of reduced phloem translocation and therefore leaf sugar accumulation during YCS likely to be the result of a physiological disorder triggered by general plant stressors ( Botha 2019 ). Although no evidence has been found to indicate leaf tissue is affected in any way beyond sugar accumulation and its feedback effect, it is possible an unknown factor could be influencing the leaf tissue studied. Current research findings of YCS are consistent with an initial trigger of stress and only later impacting the leaves through the resultant build-up of sugar, leading to YCS symptoms ( Botha 2019 ; Marquardt et al., 2019 ). Despite the complexity involved, it is clear substantial photosynthetic control takes place in the early-stages of sugar feedback regulation induced by sugar accumulation of YCS development in the leaves."

The regulation of this process, which includes sucrose feedback inhibition on photosynthesis, is an area in which understanding can potentially lead to crop yield improvement. Sugarcane is a fast growing tropical C4 grass and a major crop worldwide. Its yield is determined by sucrose transport to the culm tissue for storage or biomass production. A constant radiation use efficiency (RUE) in sugarcane crops is not achieved throughout the full crop cycle. The distinct uncoupling of the linear relationship between cumulative intercepted radiation and biomass accumulation is known as the reduced growth phenomenon (RGP) (for review van Heerden et al., 2010 ). The physiological basis for the RGP is still poorly understood but is likely to be, at least in part, associated with feedback regulation of leaf photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis, from the point of fixation through to sucrose synthesis goes through multiple control steps. This includes the capturing of light in the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) chain, initial CO 2 fixation in the mesophyll (M), decarboxylation in the bundle sheath (BS), re-fixation of CO 2 by Rubisco in the BS, Calvin cycle activity, and the partitioning of triose phosphate (TP). Generally, the majority of TP in a source leaf BS cell chloroplast is exported to the cytosol/symplast for the production of sucrose. If the synthesis of sucrose exceeds export, as occurs during the greatest photosynthetic activity hours of the day, TP is repartitioned to make starch in the BS chloroplast (in sugarcane). This serves to provide energy for dark reactions during the night through starch breakdown products. If sucrose production exceeds demand, accumulation leads to a feedback inhibitory effect that is well characterised. Much of this regulation is to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photo-oxidation, which may occur when there is insufficient reduced coenzyme regeneration ( Schottler and Toth 2014 ; and references therein). This regulation takes place through redox state signalling of PET in various forms, and subsequently photosynthetic control ( Foyer et al., 2012 ). The term photosynthetic control encompasses signalling pathways which ensure ATP and NADPH production by PET and their use in metabolism is coordinated in the short-term and long-term ( Foyer et al., 2012 ). This involves retrograde signalling (plastid to nucleus) and photosynthesis-related gene expression suppression. Leaf sugar accumulation in higher plants leads to the downregulation of a number of photosynthetic genes ( Stitt et al., 2010 ). Similar downregulation of metabolism occurs in mutants of the C4 plant maize ( Zea mays ) which are defective in phloem loading, resulting in sugar build up in the lamina ( Slewinski et al., 2009 ). A reduction in sink strength also leads to reduced photosynthetic leaf metabolism in sugarcane ( McCormick et al. 2008a , 2008b , 2009 ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ), mediated through a feedback regulation mechanism ( McCormick et al., 2008b ). Control points of photosynthesis feedback regulation by sugars in sugarcane leaves involves the decrease of carbon fixation enzyme activities and abundances, i.e. downregulation of Rubisco (EC 4.1.1.39) and phospho enol pyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase; EC 4.1.1.31) protein and protein activities ( Lobo et al., 2015 ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). Ribeiro et al. (2017) shows both Rubisco and PEPCase carboxylation capacities are reduced in vivo when sugarcane leaves are sprayed with a sucrose solution. However, photosynthesis-related gene expression changes associated with leaf sucrose accumulation in sugarcane have not been specifically investigated. It is known the gene expression of Rubisco subunits and some Calvin cycle enzymes are influenced by sugars ( McCormick et al., 2008a ; Paul and Pellny 2003 ; Smith and Stitt 2007 ). Yellow canopy syndrome (YCS) of sugarcane provides a unique approach in which to investigate the effect of sucrose accumulation, and its feedback regulatory effect, upon sugarcane leaf metabolism. Its onset coincides with excessive sugar build-up in the leaves in which the greatest accumulation of sucrose occurs in the midrib as a result of decreased export from the leaf ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ). The cause of decreased sucrose export is considered to be a physiological disorder triggered by general plant stress ( Botha 2019 ), it has not been linked to specific abiotic or biotic factors, nor nutrient levels in soil or plant. YCS is a condition affecting sugarcane grown for sucrose yield commercially in Australia. Previous work shows a build-up of sucrose in YCS-affected leaves leads to the downregulation of photosynthetic rate, decreased intercellular CO 2 and decreased stomatal conductance, all preceding visual symptoms of leaf yellowing ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ), consistent with a feedback regulation effect. Broad-scale gene expression changes in YCS leaves were investigated and showed these physiological effects were linked to differential expression largely in the areas of the thylakoid membrane and photosynthetic process ( Marquardt et al. 2017 , 2019 ). However, the specific pathways or key enzymes of photosynthesis have not been investigated. YCS can be exploited to study the effect of sugar feedback regulation upon sugarcane leaf metabolism. Sucrose, as well as hexose levels are found to be elevated in YCS-affected leaves, which presents as the initial symptom of the condition ( Marquardt et al. 2016 , 2017 ). Generally, studies of leaf sucrose accumulation require use of techniques such as cell suspension cultures, exogenous sucrose feeding, leaf section removal or plant defoliation ( Gonzali et al., 2006 ; Heinrichs et al., 2012 ; Lobo et al., 2015 ; McCormick et al., 2008a ; Muller et al., 2007 ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). This often leads to either non-physiological concentrations of sucrose or glucose introduction in the leaves, or a lack of their uptake into cells ( Van Dingenen et al., 2016 ). Stem girdling studies have investigated protein activity and abundance in sugarcane, however have not investigated gene expression changes ( McCormick et al., 2008b ). In this study we hypothesise the sugar accumulation in YCS-affected sugarcane leaves will coincide with regulatory changes in key components of photosynthesis, firstly involving PEPcase and Rubisco transcript and protein abundance. We predict this forms the initial sugar feedback regulation effect which precedes the development of yellowing symptoms in the leaves ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). We will further investigate the initial changes in transcript and protein abundance of some of the key components of photosynthesis: PSII, PSI and the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PET, other enzymes of the initial fixation and decarboxylation processes, and the Calvin cycle. This approach will further information regarding gene expression and protein changes in the different compartments (i.e. plastid and nucleus), and sensitivity differences between M and BS enzymes during sugar accumulation and photosynthetic feedback regulation in sugarcane leaves. In order to determine the early changes in photosynthetic gene expression and proteins, we generated datasets from leaf material in the early-stage (ES; pre-visual symptoms) and late-stage (LS; visually symptomatic) of sugar accumulation during YCS onset. The gene expression dataset is broadly investigated in a previous study by Marquardt et al. (2019) . In this study, specific photosynthetic pathways are investigated in combination with proteome data generated from the same sample tissue. 2 Methods 2.1 Plant material, sample collection and processing Sugarcane leaf sample collection is described in Marquardt et al. (2019) . In brief, samples were collected from the 1st ratoon field grown Saccharum spp. hybrids var. Q240 A under conventional management practices for the region in The Burdekin, Queensland, Australia. Control samples were collected from asymptomatic plants separated by more than 40 m from symptomatic plants. These were verified as control samples by checking for sugar accumulation through enzymatic methods, where sugar accumulation in the lamina is a characteristic of YCS ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). These samples where rationalised to be “true” controls as the definition of YCS onset is a characteristic yellowing of mid canopy leaves due to sugar accumulation ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). To sample leaf lamina, firstly leaves on a plant displaying YCS symptoms were numbered starting from the top where the first visible dewlap represented leaf 1, as described by Bonnett (2013) . Leaves were numbered sequentially below (2, 3, etc). Samples were taken between 8 and 10am from leaf 6, from 21 YCS-symptomatic as well as 21 asymptomatic (control) culms from separate stools. Leaf 6 was collected as it consistently displayed the desired YCS symptoms and had both asymptomatic and symptomatic sections of lamina. In order to determine early changes taking place during YCS development, YCS-symptomatic leaves were selected with sections of lamina displaying both a) symptomatic yellowing colouration (LS; late-stage YCS (yellow in colour)) and, b) green colouration (ES; early-stage YCS (green in colour)). Therefore, ES and LS lamina samples were collected from the same YCS-symptomatic leaf. This allowed the separation of early and late metabolic changes. It is known from previous studies that once a portion of lamina on a leaf displays YCS symptoms, the remaining asymptomatic lamina will eventually become symptomatic and eventually senesce. Early changes (ES tissue) were therefore representative of the initial effects of YCS onset, without dilution of downstream effects associated with leaf yellowing (LS tissue), such as senescence. ES-YCS, LS-YCS and control samples were ground to a fine powder. The lamina powder from four separate leaves was bulked to create one replicate for four of the five replicates, and the fifth created from five bulked leaves (five replicates for each sample type, using a total of 21 leaves). For each replicate, 100 mg powder was used for RNA extraction for RNA-sequencing. The remaining powder was lyophilised using a freeze dryer (CHRIST ALPHA 1–4 LSC plus, Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Germany). From this, 30 mg lyophilised powder was used for proteome analysis. 2.2 RNA isolation, sequencing & data processing Method as described in Marquardt et al. (2019) : “Paired-end reads were mapped to the sugarcane PacBio sugarcane transcriptome library (described in Hoang et al. (2017) , accessed at doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4981655). Differential expression was determined through “Differential Expression for RNA-seq” in CLC Genomics Workbench v11.0 (QIAGEN, Aarhus, Denmark) for YCS-affected ES and LS sample types against the control. Significant differential expression was determined as false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P-value <0.001 from the control.” 2.3 Identification of genes of interest in sugarcane Method as described in Marquardt et al. (2019) : “Identification of genes was performed by searching contig annotations in the PacBio sugarcane reference transcriptome annotation by Hoang et al. (2017) . Further, characterised sequences of each investigated transcript and protein from species Saccharum ( Saccharum spp.), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ), maize ( Zea mays ), rice ( Oryza sativa ) and Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) were blasted (Blastn/tBlastx) in CLC Genomics Workbench against the sugarcane transcriptome to confirm all relevant contigs were found. Relevant contigs were investigated for quality, ensuring no other known protein coding regions were present (NCBI Blastx tool against non-redundant protein sequences database ( blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov )), and adequate expression level (average TPM > 5 in at least one sample type to avoid poorly expressed contigs). Translation and ORF were checked using translation tool by ExPasy (web.expasy.org/translate). Transmembrane domain number (if relevant) checked using protein-coding sequence with TMHMM Server v. 2.0 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM ).” 2.4 Proteome data collection and processing A portion of the same sample tissue used for RNA extraction was lyophilised and used to generated proteome data. As described by Wu et al. (2016) with some differences. Samples were washed with 10% TCA containing 0.07% DTT in acetone and homogenised in 50 mM HEPES in 2% SDS buffer. Supernatant was taken and buffer exchanged with 100 mM TEAB using 5 KDa molecular weight cut-off filter (VIVASPIN 6, 5 kDa spin filter, Product #VS0612, Sartorius Stedim). The protein concentration was determined by Direct Detect. 100 μg of sample was taken for digestion and analysis. 1D and 2D IDA nanoLC (Ultra nanoLC system, Eksigent) ESI MS/MS data were acquired for each control, ES and LS lamina samples. 2D IDA nanoLC ESI MS/MS data were acquired for lamina samples collectively (including senescent and water-stressed leaf tissues not used in this study). After sample fractionation and peptide elution, the reverse phase nanoLC eluent was subject to positive ion nanoflow electrospray analysis in an information dependant acquisition mode (IDA). In the IDA mode a TOFMS survey scan was acquired (m/z 350–1500, 0.25 s), with the ten most intense multiply charged ions (1+ - 5+; counts >150) in the survey scan sequentially subjected to MS/MS analysis. MS/MS spectra were accumulated for 50 ms in the mass range m/z 100–1500 with rolling collision energy. Again, after sample fractionation and peptide elution, the reverse phase nanoLC eluent was subject to positive ion nanoflow electrospray analysis in a data independent acquisition mode (SWATH). In SWATH mode, first a TOFMS survey scan was acquired (m/z 350–1500, 0.05 s) then the 60 predefined m/z ranges were sequentially subjected to MS/MS analysis. MS/MS spectra were accumulated for 60 ms in the mass range m/z 350–1500 with rolling collision energy optimised for lowed m/z in m/z window 60 + 10%. To minimize instrument condition caused bias, SWATH data were acquired in random order for the samples with one blank run between every sample injection. The IDA LC-MS/MS data were searched using ProteinPilot v5 (Sciex) in thorough mode. Database used was down loaded from NCBI containing plants, bacteria and virus with duplication removed (December, 2017). Database size: 444479 protein entries. A library was constructed by merging all of the IDA search results. SWATH data were extracted using PeakView v2.1 (Sciex) with the following parameters: Top 6 most intense fragments of each peptide were extracted from the SWATH data sets (75 ppm mass tolerance, 10 min retention time window). Shared and modified peptides were excluded. After data processing, peptides with confidence ≥99% and FDR ≤1% (based on chromatographic feature after fragment extraction) were used for quantitation. Protein differential abundance was determined using unnormalised protein quantification values as input for package DESeq2 v1.18.1 ( Love, 2014 ) in RStudio v1.1.414 (RStudio, Inc, Boston, MA, USA). DESeq2 differential abundance analysis was used for control v YCS-affected lamina protein sample comparison in order to factor in fold-change bias generated through decreased protein concentration presence in YCS-affected lamina compared to control lamina samples. 3 Results Transcript and protein data analysed were collected from leaf lamina tissue early-stage (ES) and late-stage (LS) of sugar accumulation of YCS symptom onset and the control. The ES is defined to be when sugars were elevated in the leaf lamina tissue while the lamina remains green (no visual yellowing) in YCS onset ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ). During this stage, it is known photosynthetic rate, decreased intercellular CO 2 , and decreased stomatal conductance take place ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). The LS describes when sugars are elevated to a greater extent and visual symptoms of yellowing were present ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ). Metabolite data from the same sample material in previous work ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ) showed sucrose accumulation during YCS-onset was present in the ES (2.8-fold increase) and to a greater extent in the LS (5.5-fold increase) and both hexoses (glucose and fructose) were elevated to a greater extent than sucrose. Global transcriptome changes were also analysed in previous work ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ) to show the greatest impact to be in the chloroplast function-related transcription, which was downregulated. The leaf proteome dataset generated in this study had a total of 3503 identified proteins matching to the NCBI protein database containing plants, bacteria and virus with duplication removed (2225 unique proteins; excluding duplicate blast matches). In the ES, 249 proteins increased in abundance and 331 decreased while in the LS, 403 increased and 419 decreased. 3.1 PEPCase and Rubisco To investigate whether PEPcase and Rubisco show effects of sugar feedback regulation, contigs and proteins matching to each were searched in the datasets. Twenty contigs matching PEPCase were found and two proteins. These PEPcase transcripts and protein were largely unaffected in the ES samples, however both were distinctly downregulated in the LS ( Fig. 1 A). This suggested PEPCase regulation, through transcript and/or protein abundance, was not an early response to sugar accumulation as part of YCS onset. For Rubisco, two distinct components were investigated; the large subunit (RbcL; single copy gene encoded in the chloroplast DNA), and the small subunit (RbcS; nuclear-encoded with multiple copies), as well as Rubisco activase (RbcA), required for Rubisco activity. In the reference transcriptome, 36 RbcL contigs were found, of which 10 had adequate mapping of sequence reads and were not compromised by the presence of other genes on the contig. However, only one RbcL transcript gene was expected. All ten were included in results which displayed >5 transcripts per million (TPM) from read-mappings. Six of the 10 RbcL genes showed a frameshift in the protein-coding region. Further, two of the 10 genes (which did not contain frameshifts) attracted the majority of the sequence reads and had control sample TPM values around 3000 each (TPM values found in Supplementary Table 4 , Additional File 1). This was considered relatively low for protein of such high abundance in plant leaves. The remaining eight genes had TPM values of ≤60. In general, the two RbcL genes which represented the greatest expression values (TPM) showed a trend of slightly decreased gene expression during leaf sugar accumulation ( Fig. 1 B). The RbcL protein data contained six matches to RbcL. All had trends of greater abundance during sugar accumulation, which was pronounced in the ES ( Fig. 1 B). The data indicated a potential discrepancy between regulation of the RbcL transcript and its protein abundance in the chloroplast during sugar accumulation of YCS onset. The nuclear-expressed component, RbcS, was represented by 16 contigs and did not show expression change in the ES, however downregulation occurred in the LS ( Fig. 1 B). This was also apparent, although less pronounced, in the RbcA transcript in the LS (17 contigs analysed). Data of two RbcS proteins were similar to control across sugar accumulation of YCS development, while the analysed RbcA protein was decreased after visual symptom development ( Fig. 1 B), suggesting a tighter link between RbcA transcript and protein than with either RbcL or RbcS. To investigate effects in other parts of the photosynthetic process, the major components of each 1) light reactions (PET chain), 2) initial fixation (other than PEPcase), 3) decarboxylation and, 4) the Calvin cycle were found in the datasets and analysed (full list of transcripts and proteins can be seen in Table 1 ). 3.2 Light reactions PET chain components of PSII, PSI and the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) were investigated. A distinct pattern of components showing reduced expression was present during sugar accumulation ( Fig. 2 ). The majority of all transcription captured was contained within the PSII component ( Supplementary Table 1 , Additional File 1), which was largely in the ShPsbA (D1 protein) transcript (average control TPM value of ~287,000). The ShPsbA transcript showed distinct downregulation in the ES as well as LS, which represented a decrease in total mapped transcript in the lamina tissue ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ). The ShPsbA protein abundance matched that of its transcripts. For PSI, both the transcripts and proteins of ShPsaA and ShPsaB, (chloroplast-encoded genes; Fig. 2 B) remained stable in abundance in the ES and showed downregulation in the LS tissue. In the OEC components ( Fig. 2 C) there was also consistency between the transcript and protein levels of ShPsbQ, which decreased significantly with sugar accumulation in the leaf. The data suggest there was significant early transcriptional control involved in the levels of PsbA of PSII and PsbQ of the OEC during sugar accumulation of YCS onset. This is particularly noteworthy as the PsbA gene is encoded in the chloroplast while OEC components are nuclear-encoded. 3.3 Initial carbon fixation The process of carbon fixation in the M forms malate and aspartate for shuttling to the BS cells. It is known malate was decreased in both the ES and LS tissues of YCS-affected leaves while alternative carbon shuttle, aspartate, was only decreased in the LS ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ). Investigated here, in addition to PEPCase data shown earlier, were the cytosol-localised enzymes of carbonic anhydrase (CA; EC 4.2.1.1) and the chloroplast-localised enzymes of NADP malate dehydrogenase (NADPMD; EC 1.1.1.82), pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK; EC 2.7.9.1), and PPDK regulatory protein (PDRP; EC 2.7.4.27; Table 1 ). Gene expression and protein abundance changes of CA were similar to that of the PET components analysed; a trend of early downregulation during sugar build-up was observed which was statistically significant in the LS ( Fig. 3 A). This was also seen in PEPCase ( Fig. 1 A). However, seven transcripts of NADPMD and two of 13 PPDK were already significantly downregulated in the ES, something which was not reflected in their protein ( Fig. 3 B and C , respectively). This indicated transcript downregulation was not tightly linked to protein level changes for these enzymes. Aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) catalyses the formation of aspartate from oxaloacetate (OAA) in the M cytosol. Aspartate aminotransferase was investigated ( Fig. 3 E) to determine if plasticity of the route of carbon shuttle occurs in YCS-affected lamina. Although aspartate aminotransferase gene expression could not be uniquely attributed to C4-specific carbon shuttling, it showed no gene expression change in the ES, and displayed upregulation in the LS of sugar build-up (TPM values in Supplementary Table 2 , Additional File 1). The protein of aspartate aminotransferase showed a greater abundance in both the ES and LS tissue compared to controls (~3-fold and 5-fold, respectively). 3.4 Decarboxylation Three known pathways of decarboxylation in plants were investigated through NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADPME; EC 1.1.1.40; chloroplast; through malate shuttle), NAD-dependent malic enzyme (NADME; EC 1.1.1.39, mitochondrion; through aspartate shuttle) and PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.49; cytosol; aspartate shuttle). The sugarcane reference transcriptome ( Hoang et al., 2017 ) contained transcripts for all three decarboxylation enzymes ( Table 1 ). The enzymes of the NADPME pathway did not show a distinct pattern of change in the ES or LS ( Fig. 4 A). It was noted six transcripts showing downregulated in the LS had greater transcript levels (TPM up to 192 in control) compared to other NADPME transcripts which were upregulated or stable in expression (TPM <23 each; Supplementary Table 3 , Additional File 1). NADPME protein did not show any change from the control, regardless of sugar build-up in the leaf. The mitochondrial pathway of decarboxylation through NADMD and NADME was unaffected on a gene expression level in both the ES and LS of sugar accumulation in YCS-affected lamina ( Fig. 4 ). However, NADMD protein increased from control levels in ES tissue, but was unaffected in LS ( Fig. 4 B). Protein data for NADME was not able to be detected in the samples. The PEPCK decarboxylation pathway (CO 2 release from OAA in BS cytosol) in this study contained five investigated genes. All five PEPCK protein-coding genes were upregulated in the ES sugar accumulation (ES) ( Fig. 4 D). This was in contrast to its protein, wherein greater PEPCK protein was observed only in the LS tissue compared to control levels. 3.5 Calvin cycle Required for the activity of some Calvin cycle enzymes is the CP12 protein which binds to each glyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12), and phosphoribulokinase (PRK; EC 2.7.1.19). Importantly, CP12 is known to be linked to Calvin cycle activity ( Wedel et al., 1997 ). For this reason, CP12, GAPDH and PRK were investigated. Six genes encoding CP12 in two distinct amino acid sequence groups were found in lamina tissues and named ShCP12-1 and ShCP12-2. Both groups contained the conserved key features of CP12 protein (N-terminal cysteine pair, a C-terminal cysteine pair, and core “AWD_VEE” sequence; Rodríguez-Celma et al., 2016 ). Basic amino acid alignment tree analysis indicated ShCP12-2 branched closely to CP12-1 and CP12-2 of Arabidopsis, allowing its categorisation as type I. While ShCP12-1 was branched separately, also with that of CP12-3 of Arabidopsis, a type II CP12. The proteome data contained matches for each sequence similarity group ( Table 1 ). The three gene sequences of ShCP12-1 showed greater general transcript numbers in control leaf lamina than the three of ShCP12-2 (TPM between 16 and 47, and TPM <4.5 in ShCP12-1 and ShCP12-2 , respectively; for values see Supplementary Table 5 , Additional File 1). All ShCP12-1 genes were downregulated in both the ES and LS tissue (to a greater extent in LS; Fig. 5 A). Its protein levels showed a decrease in all tissue with sugar accumulation compared to control lamina ( Fig. 5 A). Contrastingly, ShCP12-2 genes showed upregulation coinciding with sugar accumulation, especially in the LS. However, the matching protein remained similar to control tissue levels. GAPDH was investigated in three forms; GAPDH A-type (GADA), GAPDH B-type (GADB) and NADP-dependent GAPDH (GAPN) within the reference transcriptome. GADA and GADB are known to be similar in sequence, whereby GADB contains a C-terminus extension which displays homology to CP12 ( Lopez-Calcagno et al., 2014 ). GADB showed expression patter similar to that of ShCP12-1 (downregulated in the ES and LS) during sugar build-up in the leaves. Whereas GADA and GAPN showed downregulation in the LS only ( Fig. 5 B). On the protein level, no identified GAPDH or PRK protein levels displayed differential abundance from the control. It was noted that another plastidic GAPDH, which showed homology to GADCP1 of Arabidopsis, was upregulated in the LS. This was also mirrored as a protein abundance increase. 4 Discussion Decreased photosynthetic activity and carbon fixation precedes symptom development in YCS-affected leaves as a result of sucrose accumulation ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). In this study, it was predicted this would be reflected on a biochemical level in PEPCase and Rubisco gene expression or protein levels as these are known to be early control points of sucrose-induced feedback regulation upon photosynthesis in sugarcane leaves ( Lobo et al., 2015 ; McCormick et al., 2008a ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). PEPCase and Rubisco transcript and protein level decreases were not among the early changes associated with sucrose feedback regulation of photosynthesis in YCS-affected sugarcane leaves. The earliest changes were found in transcript and protein levels of the D1 protein of PSII, PsbQ of the OEC, Calvin cycle regulatory protein CP12-1, and in gene expression of NADPMD of the carboxylation process. As sugar accumulation occurred in the lamina, CP12-1 expression and protein level, as well as substrate data, indicated Calvin cycle activity was reduced. These changes all coincided with sugar build-up and preceded visual symptom development of leaf yellowing linked to chlorophyll loss. The strong correlation between changes in transcript and protein for the PSII component of D1, PsbQ of the OEC, and CP12-1 indicated their regulation is probably largely through transcriptional control. Intriguingly, Rubisco large subunit protein (RbcL) was found to increase in the ES of sugar accumulation of YCS onset in the lamina. Reduced initial carbon fixation in M cells was reflected in downregulation of particularly NADPMD gene expression; a redox regulated protein which functions closely with the malate valve of the chloroplast envelope. This early transcriptional downregulation was not shared by enzymes of the decarboxylation process or secondary carbon fixation (Rubisco) transcripts of the bundle sheath. The data are consistent with secondary carbon fixation in the bundle sheath being regulated by protein activity or substrate availability rather than through gene expression. Further, sugar accumulation led to both chloroplast- and nuclear-gene expression regulation, which may indicate a common signalling mechanism affecting transcript expression in both compartments. 4.1 Rubisco protein abundance and transcription not early impact of sucrose feedback regulation Rubisco gene expression remained stable despite sugar accumulation leading to substantial PET gene expression changes. Rubisco catalyses what is considered to be the rate-limiting step of the Calvin cycle (carboxylation of Ribulose bisphosphate; RuBP), present only in the stroma of the chloroplasts in BS cells. Rubisco is known to decrease in activity and abundance as a result of exogenous sucrose-spraying in leaves of sugarcane ( Lobo et al., 2015 ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). Where the C3 pathway of carboxylation with Rubisco is regulated by leaf sucrose feedback mechanisms ( Lobo et al., 2015 ), in addition to the C4 pathway of PEPCase in M ( in vivo ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). However, Rubisco subunits and activase are differentially regulated where RbcL is chloroplast-encoded, requiring post-translational modifications such as ATP-consuming, chaperone-dependent folding ( Hauser et al., 2015 ; and references therein), and RbcS and activase (RbcA) are nuclear encoded. Although RbcL showed a trend (not significant) of decreased gene expression, which was not seen in RbcS and RbcA in the early stages of sugar build-up of YCS development, the RbcL protein showed greater abundance in the ES than in the control. From the literature, it is unexpected for any upregulation of RbcL to take place in tissues with decreased photosynthetic rate. Decreased photosynthetic rate occurs in the early stages of sugar accumulation and is found during YCS onset in the leaf ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). An observed rise in RbcL protein may be explained by a storage process, an example of which is found in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wherein RbcL is contained within granules during oxidative stress due to high light ( Uniacke and Zerges 2008 ). In wheat, leaf pieces exposed to continuous light without external CO 2 show accumulation of a fragment of Rubisco slightly smaller in size than RbcL ( Feller et al., 2008 ; Herrmann and Feller 1998 ; Thoenen et al., 2007 ). In order to understand more of the rise in RbcL protein in this study, same-area leaf sections could be analysed for protein abundance and activity. Regardless, it is considered unlikely the elevated RbcL protein level represented an increase of Calvin cycle activity as stomatal conductance and photosynthesis are reduced during sugar feedback regulation, which is also shown during sugar accumulation of YCS-affected lamina preceding visual symptom development. This implies decreased Calvin cycle activity due to lack of substrate and is further supported by an early reduction in malate in leaves with sugar accumulation during YCS onset, without a distinct rise in the alternative C4 carbon shuttle, aspartate ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). Of importance to Rubisco function in leaves is its assembly and activity which are regulated post-transcriptionally in multiple ways, including the binding of activase, and activase cofactor presence. Although Rubisco is found to be a relatively stable enzyme once assembled (for Rubisco biogenesis and function review see Hauser et al., 2015 ), its activity is further influenced by the redox state of PET through ATP/ADP ratio and the presence of Pi in the chloroplast. Examples of where Rubisco gene expression and protein abundance are upregulated in sugarcane include in leaves with an elevated photosynthetic rate (via source-sink balance manipulation), where increased expression of RbcL , as well as RbcS and RbcA , occurs as a long term response (between 6 and 14 days; McCormick et al., 2008a ) and the Rubisco protein increases with partial shading of sugarcane leaves, with or without the addition of exogenous sucrose feeding have been found in some varieties ( Ribeiro et al., 2017 ). This shows regulation at both the gene expression and protein level as Rubisco is upregulated when sink demand is high. On the other hand, Rubisco activity is prone to inhibition by sugar phosphates ( Bhat et al., 2017 ) and is reduced during a wide range of abiotic stresses including high temperature (through CO 2 limitation) and water deficiency (through RbcA activity limitation; Perdomo et al., 2017 ). The data presented here indicate transcriptional control of Rubisco was not an early impact of sugar accumulation in the lamina. Nor was the decrease of Rubisco component protein levels. This difference to previously reported findings may be attributed to an effect of exogenous sucrose feeding experiments compared that of reduced phloem translocation leading to sucrose accumulation during YCS development. Determining Rubisco activity changes over time during sugar accumulation in the leaf may provide additionally clarification of the carboxylation activity of the BS cells. 4.2 Chloroplast and nucleus photosynthetic gene expression displayed early sensitivity to sugar accumulation during YCS onset It is shown that when sucrose, glucose and fructose were elevated in the early stage of sugar accumulation during YCS development, clear changes in both gene expression and/or protein abundances of key components of the PSII, PSI and the OEC of the PET chain in the chloroplasts were present. This suggested both coarse-, as well as fine-control ( Foyer et al., 2012 ) of these processes as an early change during the sugar accumulation of YCS onset. The PSII D1 protein (PsbA) is chloroplast-encoded whereas the OEC components are nuclear-encoded, showing both compartments were signalled to regulate gene expression in the early-stage of sugar accumulation. Transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis-related genes is mediated through multiple pathways. Retrograde (plastid-to-nucleus) and anterograde (nucleus-to-plastid) signalling allows reactive expression changes triggered by one compartment, to affect gene expression in the other compartment (for review of retrograde signalling control of photosynthesis see Dietz et al., 2018 ). Wherein altered transcription of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs) may blanket-effect upwards of 50 chloroplasts (in M cells, often less in BS). It is possible retrograde signalling (chloroplast-to-nucleus) would trigger PhANG gene downregulation seen in the data during the early stages of sugar accumulation of YCS onset. For this to take place, sugar elevation would be expected to be present in the cytosol in the lamina (likely due to reduced phloem movement; Marquardt et al., 2019 ). Consistent with this is observed elevation of trehalose in the lamina ( Marquardt et al., 2019 ), where the precursor to trehalose, trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) is tightly linked to cellular sucrose levels ( Lunn et al., 2006 ; Yadav et al., 2014 ) and signals various regulatory effects as a result. How sucrose accumulation in leaf lamina impacts on various compartments and signalling is an area of strong research interest and may be beneficial in maximising crop yields through understanding and manipulation of photosynthesis feedback regulation of sugar ( O'Hara et al., 2013 ). Sucrose itself is present in the chloroplast in plants ( Gerrits et al., 2001 ). It was shown in mutant Arabidopsis seedlings with increased plastidic investase activity that sucrose presence represses PET chain function and PhANGs ( Tamoi et al., 2010 ). This indicates sucrose and its breakdown into hexoses in the chloroplast may be an important regulatory step during sucrose feedback regulation in cells. It is possible sucrose may be elevated in the chloroplasts during sugar feedback regulation of photosynthesis in YCS-affected leaf lamina. 4.3 Mesophyll (M) processes showed greater early impact of sugar accumulation The result presented in this study may suggest a preferential retention of BS chloroplasts/related gene expression over M in the ES of sugar accumulation of YCS onset. The ES showed a trend of decreased gene expression of enzymes of the carbon fixation process in M cells (PEPCase, CA, NADPMD, PPDK, PDRP), however, of these, significantly early downregulated (as opposed to just trend) was only NADPMD. This was not shared by BS–specific decarboxylation proteins of NADPME and re-fixation proteins of RbcS and RbcA (RbcL showed slight trend of decreased expression). Vascular function retention (including BS cells) is a feature of senescence, in order to support the salvation of nutrients through their export from the senescing leaf for use by the surviving tissues (for comprehensive review of senescence process see Lim et al., 2007 ). 4.4 Gene expression and protein abundance link It is noted care must be taken in discerning linked protein and gene expression changes occurring in multiple cell types when studying leaf lamina where all cell types are homogeneously mixed together. Of the proteins investigated, a close relationship between gene expression and protein abundance across the ES and LS was observed for PSII components, PSI components, ShPsbQ (OEC), PEPCase and CA (decarboxylation process), and CP12-1 (Calvin cycle). This suggests that gene expression is a fundamental control point in the regulation of these proteins, spanning both chloroplast and nuclear gene expression. Altogether, the data indicate that although M-enriched proteins of the major processes of initial carbon fixation show a stronger downregulation than those of the BS, both cell types show early reactions to sugar accumulation. It is possible M cells are functionally downregulated earlier than BS cells during sugar accumulation through the beginning of the senescence process. It is well known sugar accumulation in leaves triggers senescence. 4.5 NADPMD, PEPCK and CP12 gene expression were tightly regulated during sugar accumulation 4.5.1 NADPMD NADPMD displayed the most significant differential gene expression (downregulated) in the early stage of YCS of the carbon fixation enzymes. NADPMD functions by converting OAA to malate in M cell chloroplasts (may also function in reverse). The produced malate is shuttled out of M chloroplasts and into the BS chloroplast to be decarboxylated for use by Rubisco. This represents the major carbon shuttle in sugarcane C4 photosynthesis, the majority of the remaining flux is through aspartate ( Moore and Botha 2014 ). NADPMD is redox activity-regulated and functions in tandem with the malate valve on the chloroplast membrane. The malate valve exports malate from the chloroplast to the cytosol and plays an important role in balancing the chloroplast NADPH/ATP ratio ( Hameister et al., 2007 ; Scheibe 2004 ). NADPMD gene expression (nucleus-encoded) is known to be influenced under various conditions and NADPMD may be a crucial enzyme in the photosynthetic control response of the nucleus to sugar accumulation in the lamina during sugar feedback regulation during YCS onset. 4.5.2 PEPCK Gene expression analysis of PEPCK in mature leaves of sugarcane by Calsa and Figueira (2007) shows greater expression of PEPCK than NADPME which is in contrast to the data presented in this study ( Supplementary Table 3 , Additional File 1). Alternative decarboxylation pathways are important for plasticity of photosynthesis during changing environmental conditions ( Sales et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2014 ). The PEPCK decarboxylation pathway is found to be more efficient as it uses less quanta per CO 2 molecule fixed than the NADPME pathway ( Furbank 2011 ). In C3 PEPCK decarboxylation plant types, PEPCK is also known to localise to the phloem ( Chen, 2004 ). It is possible the observed upregulation during sugar accumulation of YCS onset may not be representative of changes in M or BS carbon shuttling for photosynthesis but rather due to phloem metabolism perturbances. Further investigation in this area may be of use for linking sucrose and its downstream metabolic effects. 4.5.3 CP12 The data show CP12-1 had distinct gene expression and protein abundance downregulation in the ES in the lamina. Although a second CP12 (ShCP12-2) was identified, its transcript was generally (in control tissue) very lowly expressed compared with ShCP12-1 , suggesting it is unlikely to have a large role in normal Calvin cycle function. Additionally, ShCP12-1 matched more closely to photosynthetically required CP12s in Arabidopsis (CP12-1 and CP12-2) in amino acid sequence than ShCP12-2. CP12 is known to be tightly linked to the Calvin cycle activation state and activity (for review of CP12 role in photosynthetic regulation see Lopez-Calcagno et al., 2014 ). It is redox-sensitive, representing at least one aspect which links PET and Calvin cycle activity ( Lopez-Calcagno et al., 2017 ). CP12 forms a complex with Calvin cycle enzymes GAPDH and PRK. Interesting was similarity in gene expression regulation of ShCP12-1 and ShGADB . Some chloroplast proteins contain a C-terminus extension which display homology with CP12 amino acid sequence. One such case is the A 2 B 2 GAPDH B-type subunit ( Marri et al., 2014 ; Scheibe et al., 2002 ; Sparla et al., 2002 ). If ShCP12-1 expression found in this study was an accurate measure of Calvin cycle activity, it suggests a reduction in Calvin cycle activity occurred early during sugar accumulation of YCS onset and this was linked to nuclear gene transcription of the chloroplast-localised Calvin cycle, without distinct changes in gene expression of Rubisco subunits or its activase. 4.6 A greater biochemical understanding of sugar feedback regulation It was found sucrose accumulation did not coincide with Rubisco protein abundance or transcript decrease in lamina, despite clear feedback regulation upon photosynthesis being in effect. However, it is known sugar inhibits sugarcane photosynthesis through downregulation of Rubisco synthesis and activity ( Lobo et al., 2015 ). Here we suggest photosynthesis downregulation was not initially attributed to Rubisco subunit gene expression or protein abundances, rather, may be a result of activity state through assembly and/or substrate availability. Worth noting is during exogenous sucrose feeding experiments by Lobo et al. (2015) , PSII activity is decreased, however maximum quantum yield (i.e. number of capable PSII units) was unaffected which implies a downregulation of PSII components was not taking place. Sugar accumulation in YCS-affected leaves displays delta K peak in dark-adapted fluorescence readings, indicating a decrease in functional PSII units ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). This suggests a difference in effect between sucrose-spraying induced feedback regulation (wherein sucrose levels are not elevated but hexoses are; Lobo et al., 2015 ), and sugar accumulation taking place during YCS onset. However, it is important to reiterate the initial cause of reduced phloem translocation and therefore leaf sugar accumulation during YCS likely to be the result of a physiological disorder triggered by general plant stressors ( Botha 2019 ). Although no evidence has been found to indicate leaf tissue is affected in any way beyond sugar accumulation and its feedback effect, it is possible an unknown factor could be influencing the leaf tissue studied. Current research findings of YCS are consistent with an initial trigger of stress and only later impacting the leaves through the resultant build-up of sugar, leading to YCS symptoms ( Botha 2019 ; Marquardt et al., 2019 ). Despite the complexity involved, it is clear substantial photosynthetic control takes place in the early-stages of sugar feedback regulation induced by sugar accumulation of YCS development in the leaves.
