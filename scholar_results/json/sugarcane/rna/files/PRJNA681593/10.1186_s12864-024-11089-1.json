Successive backcrosses with S. officinarum have been performed to maintain a high sugar content in hybrids [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 – 5 ]. The crosses between both species have generated modern sugarcane cultivars: plants with large genomes (10 Gb) that are highly polyploid and aneuploid, with at least 50% repetitive regions [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 – 9 ]. The hybrid genome is a mixture of chromosomes originating from S. officinarum (70–80% of all chromosomes of the hybrids) and S. spontaneum (10–20%) and recombinant chromosomes (5–10%) [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 – 7 ]. The variable ploidy intrinsic to each genotype creates a unique genomic structure with chromosome numbers varying between 40 and 128 [ 2 , 3 , 9 , 10 ], which makes the study of the sugarcane genome challenging [ 4 , 9 ]."

Recently, a highly representative genome of the R570 hybrid variety was presented to the scientific community [ 5 ]. The Miscanthus genome has sorghum as an important reference for its assembly and annotation [ 21 ], and sorghum is an ancestor of the Saccharum and Miscanthus genera. Sorghum has an assembled and annotated diploid genome that is one-tenth of the sugarcane genome size and diverged approximately eight million years ago; nevertheless, its genome has maintained strong synteny and collinearity with the Saccharum genus [ 3 , 4 , 9 , 17 , 22 , 23 ]. R570 has a high inbreeding coefficient, with approximately half being identical by descent. Furthermore, in its latest version, sorghum was also used as an important genomic reference [ 5 ]."

            "text": "Therefore, choosing a sorghum quantitative trait locus (QTL) for a trait of interest and recovering its orthologous region in sugarcane can be an efficient strategy to retrieve a potentially targeted sugarcane genomic region [ 18 ]. Recent studies with the R570 variety confirmed that a significant portion of the alleles originated from S. officinarum , and thus the sugar-accumulating origin is identical and thus largely inaccessible to QTL mapping efforts [ 5 ]. However, the genomic sequence of a cultivar does not fully reflect the genetic information about the species [ 24 ], where a cultivar may not be representative of the entire genomic content of the species [ 3 , 5 , 9 ]. The development of new commercial sugarcane varieties with relatively high yields is the main goal of most breeding programs. Plant breeders seek genotypes that can tolerate biotic and abiotic stress but also have increased sugar accumulation to increase yield [ 5 , 25 ]. The exploration of candidate genes can be aided by the use of other omic technologies, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which provides a differential assessment not only between specific tissues but also between notably different varieties and related species [ 26 ]. The transcriptome allows for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and can be leveraged to construct coexpression networks, aiming to identify coexpressed genes and expand the evidence leading to candidate genes."

            "text": "Many genes involved in the synthesis and transport of sucrose have been identified in sugarcane [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 – 31 ]. Although sucrose is synthesized in the cytosol of mesophyll cells in most plants, sugarcane requires the involvement of two cell types: the bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. Sucrose synthesis occurs predominantly in the mesophyll, utilizing glucose phosphates, which are then translocated through the conducting strands of the sheath to the vascular compartments of internodal tissues, where they finally accumulate [ 31 ]. Moreover, during the plant maturation phase, the sucrose concentration in culms increases, whereas the proportions of glucose and fructose decrease [ 32 ]. However, many processes related to sugar accumulation in sugarcane internodes are not fully understood, and possible pathways and related genes have yet to be identified."

These genomic regions were compared to understand the level of genomic structural variation and genetic differences between sugarcane and sorghum. The genes found in this region were used to search for candidate genes for sugar accumulation through gene annotation evaluation, differential expression analysis of sugarcane stem transcriptomes [ 34 ] and a coexpression network. The combination of such strategies provides a more comprehensive and robust perspective in the search for and identification of the most promising candidate genes related to sugar accumulation in sugarcane."

Shiringani et al. [ 33 ] mapped two major QTLs for Brix, one on chromosome SBI-02 and another on chromosome SBI-06, both of which significantly influence soluble solids in sorghum. However, both explain the phenotypic variation very well (QTL SBI-02 explains 21.9% of the phenotypic variation, and QTL SBI-06 explains 22.3%) and have high LOD scores (≥ 10); both also exhibit negative additive effects, but the QTL on chromosome SBI-02 reduces the number of units per allele dosage, thus making it preferable. Additionally, the ease of transferring information from the genetic map to the physical map was considered, facilitated by the closer proximity of known molecular markers within the QTL. The QTL on SBI-02 was located at position 82 and flanked by markers at position 80. In contrast, the QTL on chromosome SBI-06 was at position 16, with a known marker at position 13. The marker sequences were used to define the physical chromosomal position using v3.1 of the Sorghum bicolor genome [ 23 ] available in the Phytozome 13.0 database ( https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/ ) [ 35 ]. The QTL has a phenotypic variation of 21.9% explained by genotype (R2) and a logarithm of odds (LOD) value of 10.08 [ 33 ]. It spans from 61,568 kb to 61,952 kb on sorghum chromosome SBI-02, with an approximate total length of 385 kb. The target region was defined between 61,500 kb and 62,000 kb to ensure the recovery of the genes flanking the region."

It is resistant to smut, mosaic, and rust and is tolerant to scald [ 36 ]. The SP80-3280 variety has been widely used in studies to understand sugarcane genomics and genetics. This variety has a collection of sugarcane expressed sequence tags (SUCESTs) [ 37 ], transcriptomes [ 38 , 39 – 40 ], mapped QTLs [ 41 , 42 ], a draft genome [ 43 ], and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries [ 44 , 45 ]. The use of sorghum synteny and collinearity has also been the focus of an approach for restoring genomic regions of agronomic interest [ 18 ]. The economic importance of the IACSP93-3046 cultivar is due to its high sucrose content, good tillering, resistance to rust and suitability for mechanized harvesting [ 46 ]. This cultivar also has a transcriptome [ 38 ] and a BAC library [ 45 ]."

The BLASTn algorithm [ 47 ] was used to align the CDSs against sugarcane leaf transcripts [ 38 ] with a cutoff of E < 1e-10. Sorghum gene sequences that did not have similar transcripts in the sugarcane leaf transcriptome were compared to those in the SUCEST database [ 37 ] and the NCBI database [ 47 ]. For primer pair development, only sorghum gene sequences that aligned with sugarcane leaf transcripts or with the SUCEST [ 37 ] or NCBI [ 47 ] databases were used. Additional criteria were established as follows: the genes needed to have putative exons of 200 base pairs or larger to increase the likelihood that the primer pairs would be designed within the exon, given that the intron sizes were unknown. Furthermore, we opted not to design primer pairs for genes that were duplicated in sorghum, assuming that if a gene was duplicated in sorghum, it was likely to be duplicated in sugarcane as well, which could increase the possibility of amplifying a different region with the duplicated gene in sugarcane. The sequences of the primer pairs can be found in Supplementary Table 1."

Shiringani et al. [ 33 ] mapped two major QTLs for Brix, one on chromosome SBI-02 and another on chromosome SBI-06, both of which significantly influence soluble solids in sorghum. However, both explain the phenotypic variation very well (QTL SBI-02 explains 21.9% of the phenotypic variation, and QTL SBI-06 explains 22.3%) and have high LOD scores (≥ 10); both also exhibit negative additive effects, but the QTL on chromosome SBI-02 reduces the number of units per allele dosage, thus making it preferable. Additionally, the ease of transferring information from the genetic map to the physical map was considered, facilitated by the closer proximity of known molecular markers within the QTL. The QTL on SBI-02 was located at position 82 and flanked by markers at position 80. In contrast, the QTL on chromosome SBI-06 was at position 16, with a known marker at position 13. The marker sequences were used to define the physical chromosomal position using v3.1 of the Sorghum bicolor genome [ 23 ] available in the Phytozome 13.0 database ( https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/ ) [ 35 ]. The QTL has a phenotypic variation of 21.9% explained by genotype (R2) and a logarithm of odds (LOD) value of 10.08 [ 33 ].

The top (3rd) and bottom (8th) internodes were sampled in 2016, when the plants were six months old. RNA was extracted from these tissues and used to construct RNA-seq libraries, which were sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). The RNA-Seq reads were subjected to quality control via FastQC software [ 55 ] and trimmed with Trimmomatic v.0.39 [ 56 ]. Gene expression was quantified with Salmon v.1.1.0 software [ 57 ] using the longest isoforms of S. spontaneum CDSs as a reference and automatic annotations provided by Zhang et al. [ 16 ].

For primer pair development, only sorghum gene sequences that aligned with sugarcane leaf transcripts or with the SUCEST [ 37 ] or NCBI [ 47 ] databases were used. Additional criteria were established as follows: the genes needed to have putative exons of 200 base pairs or larger to increase the likelihood that the primer pairs would be designed within the exon, given that the intron sizes were unknown. Furthermore, we opted not to design primer pairs for genes that were duplicated in sorghum, assuming that if a gene was duplicated in sorghum, it was likely to be duplicated in sugarcane as well, which could increase the possibility of amplifying a different region with the duplicated gene in sugarcane. The sequences of the primer pairs can be found in Supplementary Table 1."

Another interesting insertion was found between genes 16 and 17; it was a gene similar to Sobic.002G135950 from sorghum, chromosome SBI-02 at position 20,517,004–20,519,005, and Sobic.002G195033 from sorghum and located at position SBI-02 58,315,718–58,317,644."

Although breaks in collinearity are observed with the variety IACSP93-3046, some of those observed are similar in both varieties, such as an inversion between genes 11 and 13 and another between genes 34 and 35. Of the 15 sequenced and annotated BACs, 11 were positive for the Sobic.002G223900 gene (gene 08), eight of which were also positive for one of the last 20 genes in the target region (genes 38 to 57).

Based on this investigation, 10 candidate genes for sugar accumulation were selected: 02, 06, 09, 10, 15, 19, 20, 23, 25, and 43 (Supplementary Table 2). These genes are possibly involved directly, indirectly, or in fundamental upstream steps involved in some phase of the process of sugar accumulation, which begins with carbon fixation from the atmosphere (photosynthesis), sucrose biosynthesis and transport to the stems, and subsequent accumulation (Supplementary Table 2)."

This approach allowed us to observe internode gene expression patterns in two commercial sugarcane varieties, IACSP93-3046 and SP80-3280, and the parental species S. officinarum and S. spontaneum . For ten genes (10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 22, 25, 34, 45, 46, and 56), no expression was detected in any biological replicate, or minimal expression was detected in up to three biological replicates. These genes may play crucial roles in other plant organs, such as leaves or roots, or could also be relevant in other stages of plant maturation. However, due to a lack of evidence of expression in the organ/tissue and maturation stages being analyzed, these genes were not considered candidates involved in sugar production.

The final network had 6,809 connected nodes (genes) and an average of 17 neighbors per node. Among these genes, 3,397 genes were identified as DEGs, and six genes were identified within the QTL.

Jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation in plant wounds also activates the expression of ERF109. ERF109 induces the biosynthesis of the auxin protein ASA1, which aids in the process of secondary root formation mediated by JA-dependent ERF109 signaling [ 83 ]. In sugarcane, more than 16,000 genes have been identified as potential targets regulated by ERF109, indicating that ERF109 has a broad influence on gene expression. Functions are diverse and include metabolic activities such as Rubisco activity, triggering the biosynthesis of hormones such as cytokinins, and gibberellin-mediated responses [ 84 ]. ERF109 was not expressed in the internodes of any of the analyzed sugar-accumulating plants or in the younger internodes of S. spontaneum , but significant expression was detected in its older internodes. In transgenic lemon, the overexpression of ERF109 causes global reprogramming of plant expression [ 85 ].

Proline is an amino acid with a unique configuration, restricting its free rotation at the α-carbon because the nitrogen and α-carbon are combined in a pyrrolidine ring. This structure contributes to the rigidity of proteins containing proline residues and requires specific enzymes, including POP, for cleavage [ 86 ]. Enzymes that specifically cleave proline are known to be involved in proline accumulation in the cytosol of plant cells. This accumulation is essential for the adaptive response of plants to adverse situations [ 87 ]. Plants accumulate proline to maintain cellular homeostasis, aid in water absorption, and better adapt to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and heavy metals. These adverse conditions lead to the excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequences such as lipid peroxidation, increased osmolyte levels, and activation of antioxidant systems [ 31 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 91 – 92 ]. As such, proline accumulation enhances adaptive responses in plants. Plants may increase proline biosynthesis in response to the above conditions or reuse presynthesized proline from proteins and peptides that are not essential [ 87 ]."

In mature plants, the relationship between leaves as a sugar source and other organs, including internodes, is critical for the regulation of photosynthesis rates and sucrose accumulation in stalks [ 74 ]. Proline interacts with other metabolites, including soluble sugars. The phenomenon of accumulated proline interacting with sucrose, for example, to adjust the osmotic balance during salt stress, has been reported [ 90 , 91 – 92 , 95 ]. However, whether this interaction could be driven by other physiological changes in different plants in response to different stimuli remains unclear. Although the connection between stress and plants has been clarified, much still needs to be elucidated. In sugarcane, the accumulation of sucrose and starch in leaves coincides with a reduction in photosynthetic rates, which occurs during low water availability [ 73 ]."

Inhibition of this enzyme affects the balance of processes involving ABA [ 97 ], such as stomatal closure in response to water, salt, and thermal stresses.

Under water stress conditions, the sugarcane genotypes with the most efficient sugar accumulation tend to maintain greater stomatal conductance [ 99 ]. The lack of expression of the ABA catabolic gene suggested that the need for stomatal conductance regulation in these plants may be linked to maintaining open stomata. Additionally, in grapes, inhibition of the ABA 8’-hydroxylase gene improves tolerance to dehydration and promotes adventitious root formation, indicating an effective strategy for coping with water stress.

POP is a cytoplasmic enzyme that hydrolyzes peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of proline residues [ 100 , 101 ]. The enzyme's three-dimensional structure allows for the postproline cleavage of peptides containing up to 30 amino acid residues [ 100 , 101 ]. Post- or preproline-cleaving enzymes can belong to different peptidase families, including aminopeptidases, endopeptidases, or oligopeptidases (PAP/PEP/POP). The most common domain in family S9 is a substrate-limiting β-propeller domain preventing unwanted digestion, while the α/β hydrolase domain catalyzes the reaction at the carboxy terminus of proline residues [ 101 ]. POP is a ubiquitous protein with a well-established structure and mechanism of action. However, its biological role in plants has not been fully elucidated. Increased POP expression in plants is known to be associated with tolerance to various types of abiotic stresses [ 100 , 102 , 103 ]. In flax, this phenomenon seems to be related to a fundamental mechanism for embryo growth in seeds [ 100 ]. In coffee, POP overexpression is linked to a significant increase in the number of branches in transgenic plants [ 102 ]. Other peptidases that hydrolyze with proline specificity are related to plant development, such as pollen development [ 89 ], flowering, increased ABA activity, protection of photosynthetic activity during salt stress, elimination of reactive oxygen species, and overall osmotic potential adjustment [ 90 ]."

POP is a cytoplasmic enzyme that hydrolyzes peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of proline residues [ 100 , 101 ]. The enzyme's three-dimensional structure allows for the postproline cleavage of peptides containing up to 30 amino acid residues [ 100 , 101 ]. Post- or preproline-cleaving enzymes can belong to different peptidase families, including aminopeptidases, endopeptidases, or oligopeptidases (PAP/PEP/POP). The most common domain in family S9 is a substrate-limiting β-propeller domain preventing unwanted digestion, while the α/β hydrolase domain catalyzes the reaction at the carboxy terminus of proline residues [ 101 ]. POP is a ubiquitous protein with a well-established structure and mechanism of action. However, its biological role in plants has not been fully elucidated. Increased POP expression in plants is known to be associated with tolerance to various types of abiotic stresses [ 100 , 102 , 103 ]. In flax, this phenomenon seems to be related to a fundamental mechanism for embryo growth in seeds [ 100 ]. In coffee, POP overexpression is linked to a significant increase in the number of branches in transgenic plants [ 102 ]. Other peptidases that hydrolyze with proline specificity are related to plant development, such as pollen development [ 89 ], flowering, increased ABA activity, protection of photosynthetic activity during salt stress, elimination of reactive oxygen species, and overall osmotic potential adjustment [ 90 ]."

Proline-cleaving enzymes are expressed when a plant needs to accumulate proline, a phenomenon that usually occurs when the plant requires osmotic regulation due to stresses such as water and salinity stress. Proline can also bind to soluble sugars such as sucrose when the homeostasis of plant cells must be regulated. Gene 01 has three first neighbors, one of which possesses the ENTH domain—a lipid-binding region crucial for clathrin-coated vesicle formation, endocytosis at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and vacuolar transport.

HARB transposons are classified as class II transposable elements (TEs) that carry out the cleavage and transfer of single DNA strands mediated by transposases [ 69 , 70 ]. The presence of these HARB transposons suggests a possible relationship between these elements and these inversions, which were present in all the examined varieties, especially with the probable pseudogenization of genes 12 and 13 (Supplementary Table 2). The process of cleavage followed by fusion may have led to the deletion of bases, resulting in the truncation of genes and, consequently, the loss of their functions.

The probable orthologous gene in the IACSP93-3046 variety is inserted in a retrotransposon similar to Copia22-ZM_I/LTR. Interestingly, this gene has all the characteristic features of being a functional gene, even when it is inserted into a TE. One possible explanation for this insertion is that the gene was cotransported with the retrotransposon. As Class II TEs, they can replicate a copy of themselves, which is subsequently inserted into different genomic regions. As such, this haplotype is highly likely to be a copy of the gene. The presence of a TE within an expressed gene (CENP-C) in sugarcane has been previously described [ 45 ], demonstrating that the proximity or overlap of TEs and genes does not hinder the function of the gene, at least in sugarcane. This gene, which is specific to the IACSP93-3046 haplotype (BAC Shy112C03), has a zinc finger domain; in plants, proteins featuring this domain are transcription factors (TFs) related to the control of cell division in totipotent tissues (petunias), histone–DNA binding (wheat), leaf budding (Chinese cabbage), soil salinity tolerance (Arabidopsis) and carbon metabolism (potato) [ 71 ]."

The dry climate during the sugar accumulation period in sugarcane, as observed during sample collection, indicates potential moderate water stress. Under water stress conditions, the sugarcane genotypes with the most efficient sugar accumulation tend to maintain greater stomatal conductance [ 99 ]. The lack of expression of the ABA catabolic gene suggested that the need for stomatal conductance regulation in these plants may be linked to maintaining open stomata. Additionally, in grapes, inhibition of the ABA 8’-hydroxylase gene improves tolerance to dehydration and promotes adventitious root formation, indicating an effective strategy for coping with water stress. Gene 23 was not expressed in the internodes (gene 13240–23—Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the plant may use this strategy to improve its tolerance to a potential water deficit."

            "text": "Gene 01 (Supplementary Table 2) shares similarities with POP, which belongs to the serine protease family (clan SC, family S9) that includes various peptidases. POP is a cytoplasmic enzyme that hydrolyzes peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of proline residues [ 100 , 101 ]. The enzyme's three-dimensional structure allows for the postproline cleavage of peptides containing up to 30 amino acid residues [ 100 , 101 ]. Post- or preproline-cleaving enzymes can belong to different peptidase families, including aminopeptidases, endopeptidases, or oligopeptidases (PAP/PEP/POP). The most common domain in family S9 is a substrate-limiting β-propeller domain preventing unwanted digestion, while the α/β hydrolase domain catalyzes the reaction at the carboxy terminus of proline residues [ 101 ]. POP is a ubiquitous protein with a well-established structure and mechanism of action. However, its biological role in plants has not been fully elucidated. Increased POP expression in plants is known to be associated with tolerance to various types of abiotic stresses [ 100 , 102 , 103 ]. In flax, this phenomenon seems to be related to a fundamental mechanism for embryo growth in seeds [ 100 ]. In coffee, POP overexpression is linked to a significant increase in the number of branches in transgenic plants [ 102 ]. Other peptidases that hydrolyze with proline specificity are related to plant development, such as pollen development [ 89 ], flowering, increased ABA activity, protection of photosynthetic activity during salt stress, elimination of reactive oxygen species, and overall osmotic potential adjustment [ 90 ]."

Although POP is related to stress resistance and tolerance, more evidence suggests that this gene is involved in this process. Proline-cleaving enzymes are expressed when a plant needs to accumulate proline, a phenomenon that usually occurs when the plant requires osmotic regulation due to stresses such as water and salinity stress. Proline can also bind to soluble sugars such as sucrose when the homeostasis of plant cells must be regulated. Gene 01 has three first neighbors, one of which possesses the ENTH domain—a lipid-binding region crucial for clathrin-coated vesicle formation, endocytosis at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and vacuolar transport. This gene could play a role in the transport of proline and sucrose, given its correlation with POP."

            "text": "This study examined the genomic architecture of a specific region in two sugarcane cultivars, validating sorghum as a key reference genome for identifying candidate genes for quantitative traits. Using a method that integrated comparative genomic analysis, RNA-seq data, and a literature review, three candidate genes involved in sugar accumulation were identified: ERF-109, ABA 8’OH, and POP. ERF-109, a versatile transcription factor, is known to be involved in metabolic processes and stress resistance. This study revealed that it potentially influences sugar accumulation. ABA 8’OH and POP are linked to proline accumulation, which is associated with stress responses and sucrose binding, indicating a possible association between sucrose and proline accumulation. This integrative method is recommended for identifying new candidate genes for sugar accumulation and other traits in sugarcane, with the aim of developing cultivars with relatively high sugar contents. We encourage more research on these three genes, believing that we can learn more about the intricate process of storing and accumulating sugar in sugarcane."

    "full_text": "Background In the 1880s, sugarcane ( Saccharum spp.) farmers crossed Saccharum spontaneum (2n = 5x = 40 to 16x = 128, x = 8), which is resistant to biotic and abiotic stress, with Saccharum officinarum (2n = 8x = 80, x = 10), which is considered a noble sugarcane due to its high sugar content. Successive backcrosses with S. officinarum have been performed to maintain a high sugar content in hybrids [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 – 5 ]. The crosses between both species have generated modern sugarcane cultivars: plants with large genomes (10 Gb) that are highly polyploid and aneuploid, with at least 50% repetitive regions [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 – 9 ]. The hybrid genome is a mixture of chromosomes originating from S. officinarum (70–80% of all chromosomes of the hybrids) and S. spontaneum (10–20%) and recombinant chromosomes (5–10%) [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 – 7 ]. The variable ploidy intrinsic to each genotype creates a unique genomic structure with chromosome numbers varying between 40 and 128 [ 2 , 3 , 9 , 10 ], which makes the study of the sugarcane genome challenging [ 4 , 9 ]. Grasses with a reference genome, such as rice [ 11 ], maize [ 12 ], wheat [ 13 ], and miscanthus ( Miscanthus sinensis ) [ 14 , 15 ], even sugarcane with an allele-defined genome of S. spontaneum [ 16 ] or a monoploid sequence reference for sugarcane [ 3 ] and sorghum [ 17 ], are commonly used as references for studies of the sugarcane genome [ 3 , 4 – 5 , 9 , 16 , 18 , 19 – 20 ]. Recently, a highly representative genome of the R570 hybrid variety was presented to the scientific community [ 5 ]. The Miscanthus genome has sorghum as an important reference for its assembly and annotation [ 21 ], and sorghum is an ancestor of the Saccharum and Miscanthus genera. Sorghum has an assembled and annotated diploid genome that is one-tenth of the sugarcane genome size and diverged approximately eight million years ago; nevertheless, its genome has maintained strong synteny and collinearity with the Saccharum genus [ 3 , 4 , 9 , 17 , 22 , 23 ]. R570 has a high inbreeding coefficient, with approximately half being identical by descent. Furthermore, in its latest version, sorghum was also used as an important genomic reference [ 5 ]. Therefore, choosing a sorghum quantitative trait locus (QTL) for a trait of interest and recovering its orthologous region in sugarcane can be an efficient strategy to retrieve a potentially targeted sugarcane genomic region [ 18 ]. Recent studies with the R570 variety confirmed that a significant portion of the alleles originated from S. officinarum , and thus the sugar-accumulating origin is identical and thus largely inaccessible to QTL mapping efforts [ 5 ]. However, the genomic sequence of a cultivar does not fully reflect the genetic information about the species [ 24 ], where a cultivar may not be representative of the entire genomic content of the species [ 3 , 5 , 9 ]. The development of new commercial sugarcane varieties with relatively high yields is the main goal of most breeding programs. Plant breeders seek genotypes that can tolerate biotic and abiotic stress but also have increased sugar accumulation to increase yield [ 5 , 25 ]. The exploration of candidate genes can be aided by the use of other omic technologies, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which provides a differential assessment not only between specific tissues but also between notably different varieties and related species [ 26 ]. The transcriptome allows for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and can be leveraged to construct coexpression networks, aiming to identify coexpressed genes and expand the evidence leading to candidate genes. Many genes involved in the synthesis and transport of sucrose have been identified in sugarcane [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 – 31 ]. Although sucrose is synthesized in the cytosol of mesophyll cells in most plants, sugarcane requires the involvement of two cell types: the bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. Sucrose synthesis occurs predominantly in the mesophyll, utilizing glucose phosphates, which are then translocated through the conducting strands of the sheath to the vascular compartments of internodal tissues, where they finally accumulate [ 31 ]. Moreover, during the plant maturation phase, the sucrose concentration in culms increases, whereas the proportions of glucose and fructose decrease [ 32 ]. However, many processes related to sugar accumulation in sugarcane internodes are not fully understood, and possible pathways and related genes have yet to be identified. In this context, a sorghum QTL for Brix [ 33 ] in sorghum was chosen as a target, and its orthologous region was recovered from two Brazilian cultivars (SP80-3280 and IACSP93-3046) and compared with R570 [ 3 ] and the S. spontaneum genome [ 16 ]. These genomic regions were compared to understand the level of genomic structural variation and genetic differences between sugarcane and sorghum. The genes found in this region were used to search for candidate genes for sugar accumulation through gene annotation evaluation, differential expression analysis of sugarcane stem transcriptomes [ 34 ] and a coexpression network. The combination of such strategies provides a more comprehensive and robust perspective in the search for and identification of the most promising candidate genes related to sugar accumulation in sugarcane. Methods Sorghum region of interest A partial QTL that was mapped in sorghum for Brix was selected based on phenotypic variation and concurrently had a high LOD score; this QTL is genetically located on chromosome SBI-02 between the EST-SSR markers Xtxp56 and Stgnhsbm36 [ 33 ]. Shiringani et al. [ 33 ] mapped two major QTLs for Brix, one on chromosome SBI-02 and another on chromosome SBI-06, both of which significantly influence soluble solids in sorghum. However, both explain the phenotypic variation very well (QTL SBI-02 explains 21.9% of the phenotypic variation, and QTL SBI-06 explains 22.3%) and have high LOD scores (≥ 10); both also exhibit negative additive effects, but the QTL on chromosome SBI-02 reduces the number of units per allele dosage, thus making it preferable. Additionally, the ease of transferring information from the genetic map to the physical map was considered, facilitated by the closer proximity of known molecular markers within the QTL. The QTL on SBI-02 was located at position 82 and flanked by markers at position 80. In contrast, the QTL on chromosome SBI-06 was at position 16, with a known marker at position 13. The marker sequences were used to define the physical chromosomal position using v3.1 of the Sorghum bicolor genome [ 23 ] available in the Phytozome 13.0 database ( https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/ ) [ 35 ]. The QTL has a phenotypic variation of 21.9% explained by genotype (R2) and a logarithm of odds (LOD) value of 10.08 [ 33 ]. It spans from 61,568 kb to 61,952 kb on sorghum chromosome SBI-02, with an approximate total length of 385 kb. The target region was defined between 61,500 kb and 62,000 kb to ensure the recovery of the genes flanking the region. Plant material Two Brazilian sugarcane cultivars were analyzed in the present study. SP80-3280 is known for its high production of sucrose and good tillering ability. It is resistant to smut, mosaic, and rust and is tolerant to scald [ 36 ]. The SP80-3280 variety has been widely used in studies to understand sugarcane genomics and genetics. This variety has a collection of sugarcane expressed sequence tags (SUCESTs) [ 37 ], transcriptomes [ 38 , 39 – 40 ], mapped QTLs [ 41 , 42 ], a draft genome [ 43 ], and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries [ 44 , 45 ]. The use of sorghum synteny and collinearity has also been the focus of an approach for restoring genomic regions of agronomic interest [ 18 ]. The economic importance of the IACSP93-3046 cultivar is due to its high sucrose content, good tillering, resistance to rust and suitability for mechanized harvesting [ 46 ]. This cultivar also has a transcriptome [ 38 ] and a BAC library [ 45 ]. Recovering the sorghum ortholog region in sugarcane Primer design The coding sequences (CDSs) of genes within the target sorghum genomic region were retrieved, along with five genes upstream and two genes downstream of the delimited region, totaling 58 genes. The BLASTn algorithm [ 47 ] was used to align the CDSs against sugarcane leaf transcripts [ 38 ] with a cutoff of E < 1e-10. Sorghum gene sequences that did not have similar transcripts in the sugarcane leaf transcriptome were compared to those in the SUCEST database [ 37 ] and the NCBI database [ 47 ]. For primer pair development, only sorghum gene sequences that aligned with sugarcane leaf transcripts or with the SUCEST [ 37 ] or NCBI [ 47 ] databases were used. Additional criteria were established as follows: the genes needed to have putative exons of 200 base pairs or larger to increase the likelihood that the primer pairs would be designed within the exon, given that the intron sizes were unknown. Furthermore, we opted not to design primer pairs for genes that were duplicated in sorghum, assuming that if a gene was duplicated in sorghum, it was likely to be duplicated in sugarcane as well, which could increase the possibility of amplifying a different region with the duplicated gene in sugarcane. The sequences of the primer pairs can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Identification of BAC clones, sequencing and assembly BAC libraries from the varieties SP80-3280 and IACSP93-3046 [ 45 ] were used to recover the sequences of interest in the equivalent target region of sorghum in sugarcane varieties. Positive clone selection and preparation of BAC DNA for sequencing and pooling were performed using the steps described previously [ 19 ]. Sequencing was performed on the PacBio® Sequel platform (Pacific Biosciences) at the Arizona Genomics Institute (AGI, Tucson, AZ, USA). The vector and Escherichia coli genomic sequences were removed with the BBtools package ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/ ). Assembly was performed with the Canu v2.1 program [ 48 ] with the default parameters, except for corOutCoverage = 200. The refinement of the final contig consensus sequence was performed by aligning the raw reads to the assembled contigs with the pbalign program, and error correction was performed with the Arrow program. Both programs are present in the SMRTLink v7.0 package (Pacific Biosciences). Annotation of contig sequences The annotation of BACs for repetitive elements was performed using the LTR FINDER retrotransposon predictor [ 49 ] and the giriREPBASE database [ 50 ]. Gene annotation was performed with the NCBI [ 47 ] and Phytozome v12.0 [ 35 ] databases. The Artemis program of the Sanger Institute [ 51 ] was used to visualize genes and repetitive elements. The sorghum CDSs and the manually annotated sugarcane variety CDSs were used to perform similarity searches with BLASTn tools [ 47 ] against the following databases: NCBI [ 52 ], UniProt [ 53 ] and Pfam (Protein Families) [ 54 ]. Genes were considered similar if they exhibited a sequence identity of 80% or greater. Contigs that did not have genes, had only one gene or were smaller than 25 kb in size were discarded. Manual curation of orthologous regions in S. spontaneum A manual homology curation of the orthologous regions in S. spontaneum was performed. The CDSs of each QTL sorghum gene were aligned to the four alleles of the Sspon02 chromosomal set using BLASTn tools [ 47 ]. This approach allowed for enhanced accuracy of the automated annotation performed previously [ 16 ], including the identification of pseudogenes, thereby providing a more precise definition of the genomic architecture in this specific region in S. spontaneum . The information obtained was used for a detailed literature review of each gene and their derived proteins (Supplementary Table 2), as well as their functions, the biological pathways in which they were presumably implicated, and their potential role in sugar accumulation in plants, particularly grasses and sugarcane. Comparative genomic analyses Comparative analyses were performed between the genes present in the target region in both varieties. In addition, the genes of the orthologous region in the S. bicolor, S. spontaneum [ 16 ] and the sugarcane hybrid variety R570 [ 3 ] genomes (Phytozome 12) [ 35 ] were also used for a comparative analysis. The analyses were performed to determine the synteny, collinearity and genomic structure of the region. The homologous region in S. spontaneum was located using the BLASTn tool [ 47 ] by searching against the four homologous chromosome sequences of the S. spontaneum homologous chromosome 02 group (Sspon02), and are thus called Sspon2A, Sspon2B, Sspon2C and Sspon2D [ 16 ]. Genes were manually curated only in the sorghum orthologous region using the Artemis program from the Sanger Institute [ 51 ] for visualization, utilizing the NCBI [ 52 ] and Phytozome 12.0 [ 35 ] databases for assistance. Differential gene expression analysis The expression of genes within the QTL region was analyzed in internode tissues using sugarcane RNA-Seq data generated by Aono et al. [ 34 ]. Briefly, the IACSP93-3046 and SP80-3280 varieties, as well as the parental species S. officinarum (Badila de Java) and S. spontaneum (Krakatau), were grown in a field in Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil, with three replicates. The top (3rd) and bottom (8th) internodes were sampled in 2016, when the plants were six months old. RNA was extracted from these tissues and used to construct RNA-seq libraries, which were sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). The RNA-Seq reads were subjected to quality control via FastQC software [ 55 ] and trimmed with Trimmomatic v.0.39 [ 56 ]. Gene expression was quantified with Salmon v.1.1.0 software [ 57 ] using the longest isoforms of S. spontaneum CDSs as a reference and automatic annotations provided by Zhang et al. [ 16 ]. A heatmap depicting the expression of all genes within the QTL that was automatically annotated by Zhang et al. [ 16 ] was generated using the pheatmap R package [ 58 ] in R software [ 59 ]. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the edgeR package version 3.38.4 [ 60 ]. The raw count data obtained from Salmon software first underwent normalization using the counts per million (CPM) method. Genes with a CPM value ≥ 1 in all samples of at least one biological condition were retained. Counts were subsequently normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method to identify DEGs. Statistical comparisons were conducted between S. spontaneum samples and all other samples. DEGs were determined using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of p ≤ 0.05 and a log2 fold change (FC) cutoff of ≥ 1. Gene coexpression network analyses A gene coexpression network was constructed with R software employing the highest reciprocal rank (HRR) methodology to further investigate the biological processes associated with the genes within the QTL [ 61 ]. The raw count data were normalized using the transcripts per million (TPM) method, and genes with a TPM > 0 in all samples of at least one biological condition were retained. Pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficients (R) were calculated for pairs of filtered genes. A minimum absolute correlation coefficient threshold of 0.8, which is frequently employed in gene coexpression network studies [ 62 , 63 ], was used to consider two genes as connected and to ensure robust associations. The generated network was visualized via Cytoscape version 3.10.0 [ 64 ]. Results QTL gene identification, BAC clone selection, sequencing, assembly and annotation In the QTL for Brix in sorghum, 58 genes were identified, 21 of which were aligned with sugarcane leaf transcripts and presented exons with sizes equal to or greater than 200 bp. Primer pairs were developed for these 21 genes, and one pair failed to produce amplicons. The 20 primer pairs developed were used to screen clones of interest in the BAC libraries of the SP80-3280 and IACSP93-3046 varieties. Among the remaining 38 genes, 14 were found to be duplicated in the sorghum genome, and 24 did not meet the other selection criteria. For each gene, a number was assigned, except for two tandemly duplicated genes, which were assigned a single number (25), as shown in Supplementary Table 2, for a total of 57 genes. In the screening of the BAC library of IACSP93-3046, 37 clones were positive for at least two genes, and 30 clones were sequenced. Among these contigs, 28 were assembled and manually annotated, representing 26 BACs. In the screening of the BAC library of SP80-3280, 56 clones were positive for at least two genes, and 31 clones were sequenced. Of these clones, genes from the region were present in 16 assembled contigs and were manually annotated, representing 16 BACs. The size of all the contigs varied between 3,960 bp (pool 25) and 192,924 bp (pool 17), and the total length of the contigs was 5,850,46 bp (Supplementary Table 3). From the 71 contigs that were generated, 43 carried the genes from the target region. Each contig was related to a BAC, and some BACs were represented by two contigs (Supplementary Table 4). The sorghum orthologous region was recovered from the variety IACSP93-3046 (Fig. 1 ), which has 50 annotated genes. Seven sorghum genes were not found in the recovered sequence (Fig. 1 ). A gap was present between genes 35 and 36. In one of the haplotypes, one annotated gene did not belong to this region in sorghum, although it is located in another region of sorghum chromosome SBI-02. In the SP80-3280 variety (Fig. 2 ), the region was recovered almost in its entirety, with 44 annotated genes. Of the seven genes that were not found in the IACSP93-3046 contig sequences, six were not found in this variety, and one was annotated as a pseudogene. Two gaps were observed, one between genes 24 and 26 and the other between genes 43 and 47. Fig. 1 Genomic regions of the sorghum × IACSP93-3046 variety. Genomic region of sorghum × IACSP93-3046. Each pentagon represents a gene and shows the orientation of the gene in the genome, where right-facing arrows indicate the sense direction and left-facing arrows indicate the antisense direction. The solid lines with pentagons in red and yellow represent the QTL genes of sorghum, and the yellow genes lacking orthologs in the SP80-3280, IACSP93-3046, and R570 varieties. For each gene, a number has been designated, and the name assigned to it in Phytozome v.13 is indicated above each gene. The genomic region of the IACSP93-3046 variety is shown below. Each solid line below the genomic region of sorghum represents a haplotype, and each haplotype may be formed by one or two BACs (Supplementary Table 4). In the IACSP93-3046 genomic region, 50 genes between genes and pseudogenes were recovered. The gene represented in purple, just below the line of one of the haplotypes, is an exclusive finding within this BAC, indicating that it was observed between the two genes immediately above, namely, genes 16 and 17. This gene is not one of the 57 QTL genes of sorghum; however, it is similar to the sorghum gene Sobic.002G00135950 (Phytozome v.13). A pseudogene orthologous to this gene was observed on chromosome Sspon2B (Supplementary Fig. 2). The inversions are indicated by crossed solid lines and occurred between genes 11 and 13 and between genes 34 and 35; the haplotypes below also have the same inversion represented above. Gene 57 is duplicated, and the duplicate is pseudogenized out of the QTL order and is indicated by a gray pentagon with the number 57. The haplotypes were used to reconstruct the genomic region of the IACSP93-3046 variety Fig. 2 Genomic regions of the sorghum × SP80-3280 variety. Each pentagon represents a gene and shows the orientation of the gene in the genome, where right-facing arrows indicate the sense direction and left-facing arrows indicate the antisense direction. The solid lines with pentagons in red and yellow represent the QTL genes of sorghum, and the yellow genes lacking orthologs in the SP80-3280, IACSP93-3046, and R570 varieties. For each gene, a number has been designated (Supplementary Table 2), and the name assigned to it in Phytozome v.13 is indicated above each gene. A genomic region of the SP80–3280 variety is presented below. Each solid line represents a haplotype, and the blue and gray pentagons represent the genes and pseudogenes of the SP80-3280 variety simultaneously. Each haplotype is formed by one or two BACs (Supplementary Table 4). A total of 44 genes were recovered between genes and pseudogenes. Inversions are represented by solid crossed lines and occur between genes 11 and 13 and between genes 34 and 35. All haplotypes below the first inversion representation have similar inversions. The haplotypes reconstructed the genomic region of the SP80–3280 variety Forty-five pseudogenes were identified among the homologous genes in the variety IACSP93-3046 and nine pseudogenes in the variety SP80-3280. In the variety IACSP93-3046, genes with insertions of transposons in intronic regions (6–13.3%), insertions/deletions of one or more nucleotides (36–80%) and partial gene sequences (3–6.7%) were considered pseudogenes. Among nine homologous genes considered pseudogenes in SP80-3280, four (44.5%) presented an insertion/deletion of one or more nucleotides, three (33.5%) presented a transposon insertion in intronic regions, and in two (22.2%) of these genes, the pseudogene was a fragment of the gene. Main differences in sorghum‒sugarcane synteny and collinearity in the target region Chromosome Sspon2A (Supplementary Fig. 1): The orthologous region on chromosome Sspon2A is 794,054 bp long and is the closest in size to chromosome SbI-02 of sorghum. It is located between bases 35,019,101 and 35,813,155. Among the 57 genes present in sorghum, 50 orthologs were found in Sspon2A. The seven missing orthologous genes (03, 14, 24, 40, 46, 55 and 56) were not detected throughout the chromosome and not only in the delimited region; they were not detected in the IACSP93-3046, SP80-3280 and R570 varieties. In the region delimited in Sspon2A, the gene Sspon.02G0013290 was found, and it is orthologous to a sorghum gene from chromosome Sb10 (Sobic.010G093001). Three additional genes were not detected in the IACSP93-3046 and R570 varieties, 31 and 43; these genes were detected on chromosome Sspon2A but as pseudogenes. Gene 51 was also detected as a pseudogene in the SP80-3280 variety but was detected in the IACSP93-3046 and R570 varieties. Eight inversions were observed, two of which were common to the varieties IACSP93-3046 and SP80-3280, and they involved two to eight genes. Duplications, some in tandem, were also observed. Therefore, synteny occurs, as almost all the genes are present, but many breaks in collinearity are observed. Chromosome Sspon2B (Supplementary Fig. 2)—On this chromosome, 1,134,230 bp are present between the first and last genes of the studied region, more than double the region in sorghum, which is located between bases 32,312,667 and 33,446,897. In this chromosome, many collinearity breaks, with inversions and insertions within a cluster of 12 genes, were observed. In this orthologous region, rearrangements and reorganizations were observed, but most of the genes were present, guaranteeing synteny. Of the 57 genes present in sorghum, six were absent from the entire chromosome: 07, 26, 27 and 28. Genes 14 and 31 were also missing and were not found in the IACSP93-3046, SP80-3280 or R570 varieties. An insertion containing a cluster of 16 genes was observed in the genomic region of this homologous chromosome, with eight of these genes being orthologous to genes located on sorghum chromosome SBI-02 between positions 62,116 kb and 62,216 kb, which is close to the target region investigate din this study. Chromosome Sspon2C (Supplementary Fig. 3): The chromosome Sspon2C region is the region that most resembles sorghum chromosome SBI-02. Considering synteny, although it is located between the first gene and the last gene, it is almost twice the size of the region, reaching 969,275 bp, and is located between bases 37,413,201 and 38,382,476. As in the other alleles, Sspon2C also has collinearity breaks with inversions and insertions, and gene sequences from the region are displaced and inserted in other stretches. Among the 57 sorghum genes in the region, two (genes 14 and 31) are absent on this chromosome, and these genes are also absent in the hybrid varieties IACSP93-3046, SP80-3280 and R570. Although the region is quite large, compared with sorghum, no insertions with genes similar to those of other chromosomes in S. spontaneum are observed. Chromosome Sspon2D (Supplementary Fig. 4): This chromosome also maintains synteny with sorghum. Among the 57 genes in the sorghum region, 51 remained in Sspon2D. Among the six missing genes, four were not detected in the IACSP93-3046, SP80-3280 or R570 varieties. The region was divided into two subregions. The first subregion is between bases 28,425,371 and 29,097,118 (671,747 bp), and the second subregion is between bases 49,915,069 and 50,120,906 (205,837 bp). These two subregions are separated by approximately 21 Mb in length. IACSP93-3046 (Fig. 1 )—This region was recovered with 29 annotated BACs. The synteny between sorghum and sugarcane in this specific region was confirmed, but some collinearity breaks were detected. Two inversions were observed, one between genes 11 and 13 and the other between genes 34 and 35. These inversions were observed in all haplotypes where these genes could be present. Gene 25, which is duplicated in sorghum, appeared in a single copy in the annotated haplotypes; however, gene 26 was duplicated in one of the three haplotypes observed. A sequence of three genes (53, 54 and 55) was duplicated exactly in this sequence, resulting in a collinearity break; however, this finding appeared in only one of the seven haplotypes that could have these genes. In one annotated BAC, an insertion of gene 57 between genes 52 and 53 was observed. Another interesting insertion was found between genes 16 and 17; it was a gene similar to Sobic.002G135950 from sorghum, chromosome SBI-02 at position 20,517,004–20,519,005, and Sobic.002G195033 from sorghum and located at position SBI-02 58,315,718–58,317,644. SP80-3280 variety (Fig. 2 )—Of the 31 sequenced clones, 16 were recognized as part of the target region using BLASTn. The orthologous region was partially recovered using BACs belonging to this region. Among the recovered genes, synteny and collinearity may be presumed. Although breaks in collinearity are observed with the variety IACSP93-3046, some of those observed are similar in both varieties, such as an inversion between genes 11 and 13 and another between genes 34 and 35. Of the 15 sequenced and annotated BACs, 11 were positive for the Sobic.002G223900 gene (gene 08), eight of which were also positive for one of the last 20 genes in the target region (genes 38 to 57). Some genes were not observed in the annotations of the varieties IACSP93-3046 and R570; this situation also occurred with the variety SP80-3280, except for one gene (51) that was observed as a possible pseudogene. Two pronounced gaps were detected: the absence of BACs containing genes 24 to 26 and the absence of BACs containing genes 43 to 47. The last gene flanking the region, 57, was also not recovered. R570 (Supplementary Fig. 5)—Upon comparing the findings of Brazilian varieties with those of R570, some commonalities were observed. The inversion between genes 11 and 13 is present in all three hybrid cultivars, indicating that this observation is characteristic of the Saccharum genus, as it is also observed in S. spontaneum . Tandem duplications, such as those of gene 25, were noted, mirroring observations in sorghum. Interestingly, IACSP93-3046 lacks this duplication, and due to a gap in the sequencing of this region, this duplication could not be detected in SP80-3280. In R570, genes 48 and 49 are duplicated in tandem, a feature not observed in sorghum. Similar findings were not observed in S. spontaneum or in the varieties SP80-3280 and IACSP93-3046. Expression analysis and search for candidate genes related to sugar accumulation: Investigation of selected genes A summary of genes 01 to 57, their orthologs in S. spontaneum and S. bicolor , as well as their proteins, is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Among those genes, a total of 51 genes were observed in the SP80-3280 and IACSP93-3046 varieties. For each of these genes, an investigative approach was adopted utilizing relevant published studies to elucidate their biological roles, molecular interactions, and possible functions in physiological processes. Based on this investigation, 10 candidate genes for sugar accumulation were selected: 02, 06, 09, 10, 15, 19, 20, 23, 25, and 43 (Supplementary Table 2). These genes are possibly involved directly, indirectly, or in fundamental upstream steps involved in some phase of the process of sugar accumulation, which begins with carbon fixation from the atmosphere (photosynthesis), sucrose biosynthesis and transport to the stems, and subsequent accumulation (Supplementary Table 2). DEG analyses The expression of the genes within the QTL was evaluated using RNA-Seq data from internodes 3 (younger) and 8 (more mature) of IACSP93-3046 and SP80-3280, as well as data from accessions of the two species considered the main ancestors of modern cultivars, namely, S. spontaneum and S. officinarum . Seven of the 51 sorghum genes being analyzed had no orthologs represented in the S. spontaneum genome, which was used for the gene quantification procedures; therefore, they are not represented in the expression data. A heatmap depicting the expression of the remaining 44 genes normalized by TPM is shown in Fig. 3 . This approach allowed us to observe internode gene expression patterns in two commercial sugarcane varieties, IACSP93-3046 and SP80-3280, and the parental species S. officinarum and S. spontaneum . For ten genes (10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 22, 25, 34, 45, 46, and 56), no expression was detected in any biological replicate, or minimal expression was detected in up to three biological replicates. These genes may play crucial roles in other plant organs, such as leaves or roots, or could also be relevant in other stages of plant maturation. However, due to a lack of evidence of expression in the organ/tissue and maturation stages being analyzed, these genes were not considered candidates involved in sugar production. Fig. 3 Heatmap representing the level of gene expression in the internodes of SP80-3280, IACSP93-3046, S. officinarum and S. spontaneum. A heatmap depicting gene expression levels across tissues and internodes 3 (top) and 8 (bottom) of sugarcane plants (varieties SP80-3280 and IACSP93-3046 ; S. officinarum and S. spontaneum ) in triplicate. The darker the shade of green is, the higher the expression level After filtering, 22,859 of the 35,471 genes present in the S. spontaneum CDSs were stably expressed under at least one biological condition and were thus retained for DEG analyses. By comparing varieties with high ( S. officinarum , IACSP93-3046, and SP80-3280) and low ( S. spontaneum ) sugar contents, 6,264 DEGs were identified (Supplementary Table 4). Seven genes within the QTL region were DEGs; their log2(FC) values, FDR-corrected p values and annotations are available in Table 1 . Table 1 Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between non-accumulating sugar plants ( S. spontaneum ) and accumulating sugar plants (SP80-3280 and IACSP93-3046 varieties, and S. officinarum ) located within the QTL under analysis Gene number log2(FC) P value S. spontaneum gene/protein and description 01 2.049208548 1.5015E-06 Sspon.02G0013480— Similar to prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), an enzyme that cleaves oligopeptides up to 30 amino acid residues postproline [ 100 ] 09 2.826212214 0.003517002 Sspon.02G0014420— The conversion of CO 2 and water to bicarbonate and the release of a proton is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (CA), the first enzymatic step of photosynthesis in C4 plants. This reaction takes place in the mesophyll cells.

Remorines may be associated with the regulation and translocation of photoassimilates. A specific type, GSD1, belonging to group 6 of remorines, has the function of regulating the conductance of photoassimilates through plasmodesmata in rice [ 106 , 107 ] 22 1.306514099 0.00043504 Sspon.02G0013260— B-type HSF are classically transcriptional repressor proteins [ 108 ]. In grape HSFB1 has expression induced by heat stress. In rice, HSFB1 expression was related to cold. The gene has increased transcription when the plant is undergoing abiotic stresses, however, they act mainly as transcriptional repressors [ 109 , 110 ] 23 −5.246110673 0.009820214 Sspon.02G0013240— ABA 8'-hydroxylase (ABA 8’OH) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of the hormone ABA (abscisic acid). ABA is inactive when it has a hydroxyl group (OH) at its 8' position, while its removal makes it active. ABA is involved in the closure of stomata, which are crucial structures in photosynthetic processes as they regulate gas exchange between the environment and the plant [ 111 ] 26 −17.55155671 5.38665E-05 Sspon.02G0013210— Studies suggest that ERF109 is a positive regulator of cold tolerance [ 85 ]. Other classic abiotic stresses also regulate ERF109 [ 112 ]. The gene, in joint action, also regulates defense against some pathogens [ 113 ] 42 2.410548623 0.005106978 Sspon.02G0037370— Uncharacterized protein—predicted [ 114 ] Gene coexpression network analyses Based on the expression data, an HRR coexpression network (Supplementary Fig. 5) was constructed to explore new evidence that could contribute to the search for candidate genes. During the filtering procedures, 7,565 genes were excluded, and the remaining 27,906 genes were used as inputs to construct the network. The final network had 6,809 connected nodes (genes) and an average of 17 neighbors per node. Among these genes, 3,397 genes were identified as DEGs, and six genes were identified within the QTL. A first neighbor search was employed to identify genes related to potential sugar accumulation candidates and to assess whether these genes could support their roles in this process. The first neighbors of the genes within the QTL represented in the network can be seen in Table 2 . Three of these genes—01, 23, and 26—were also identified as DEGs (Table 1 ). Table 2 Sugarcane genes and their first neighbors identified by coexpression network analysis. The first neighbor genes are defined by their names in S. spontaneum , and their descriptions are based on the annotations of the EMBL database Gene Number Protein (Phytozome v.13) [ 45 ] First neighbors/description 01 POP - Similar to prolyl oligopeptidase family Sspon.01G0011190— The gene shares similarity with the IQ motif, known for its interaction with calmodulins in plant cells. This interaction influences the function of the target protein, particularly in cytoskeletal processes and cellular development, with a primary role in regulating signaling alongside CaM, CML, and CAMTA proteins [ 115 ] Sspon.01G0011270— No translating CDS [ 116 ]. The sequence has 73.7% identity with a protein containing the RRM domain from Miscanthus lutarioparius [ 114 ] Sspon.01G0011300— This gene is equipped with a ENTH domain responsible for lipid binding, pivotal in the creation of clathrin-coated vesicles, trans-Golgi network (TGN) endocytosis, and vacuolar transport, contributing to the plant's immune response. Proteins within the ANTH/ENTH/VHS family display functional redundancy, likely shaped by natural selection, necessitating mutations in at least two genes to significantly affect plant function [ 117 ] 07 Similar to a membrane protein, possibly structural. (GO:0016020) Sspon.01G0010650— similar to MYB46, a transcription factor, activates genes for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin synthesis, interacting with other transcription factors. In apples, MYB46 overexpression enhances salt tolerance, stress response, and promotes secondary cell wall biosynthesis, including lignin deposition by binding directly to relevant gene promoters. Activated during plant stress, MYB46 regulates genes involved in both biotic and abiotic stress responses [ 75 ] 18 Protein belonging to the GDXG family. Similar to alpha/beta hydrolase ( ABH ) Sspon.01G0019580— No translating CDS, The intronic sequence of this gene is 100% identical to the Sobic.001G217300 gene in sorghum. However, in sorghum, this gene consists of three exons, whereas in S. spontaneum , it contains seven exons, with the additional four exons being the first four in the sequence [ 114 ] Sspon.01G0019780— Segments of the gene exhibit similarities to various segments on sorghum chromosome 1, encompassing both small gene fragments and intergenic regions [ 114 ] 23 ABA8' OH - Similar to Abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase Sspon.01G0005990— This gene shares 94.1% similarity with Miscanthus lutarioriparius ' s-acetyltransferase, identified as a palmitoyltransferase (PAT16). Acetyltransferases, influencing protein modification in plants, transfer acetyl groups from Acetyl-CoA. Palmitoyltransferases specifically add a 16-carbon palmitate to proteins, crucial for membrane protein function by anchoring to the cell membrane [ 118 ] 26 ERF109- Similar to Ethylene Responsive factor 109 Sspon.01G0005860— NRAMP genes in plants are key players in selectively absorbing and transporting essential transition metals during heavy metal stress. Regulated by phytohormones, these genes maintain metal balance. A research with potatoes unveils molecular insights for potential development of low-metal-accumulating plant varieties. In essence, NRAMP genes are vital for plant resilience to heavy metal stress [ 119 ] 37 PP2C - Similar to protein phosphatase 2C Sspon.01G0005530— In S. spontaneum, there are two isoforms of this gene, one encoding NPG1 (NO pollen germination 1) and a nontranslating CDS. The latter is annotated with two additional exons compared to its sorghum counterpart. This isoform features the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. The TPR domain is explored in a study with tomatoes, influencing cell regulation, gene expression, and stress responses. The same study with tomatoes suggests the TPR gene has a potential link to energy metabolism and acts as a mediator in disease resistance [ 120 ] Gene 01 (prolyl oligopeptidase—POP) exhibited relatively low expression in the stems of S. spontaneum and relatively high expression in samples from sugar-accumulating plants. Gene 23 (abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase 3—ABA8’OH) has virtually no expression in the internodes of the sugar-accumulating plants sampled and is expressed at low levels in S. spontaneum . Gene 26 (ethylene responsive factor 109—ERF109) also has almost no expression in sugarcane plants, whereas it is expressed in S. spontaneum ; however, in this case, significantly higher expression is detected in the more mature internodes of S. spontaneum (I8) than in the less mature internodes (I3). This evidence led to the selection of genes 01, 23, and 26 as the primary candidate genes in the QTL for sugar accumulation. Discussion Main differences in genomic architecture Synteny and collinearity have been used to compare and recover genomic regions of interest in sugarcane using sorghum [ 3 , 5 , 9 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 22 , 23 , 34 , 45 , 65 ], and Miscanthus [ 21 , 66 , 67 ] genomes as references, revealing high gene retention [ 3 , 18 , 45 , 68 ]. The comparison of the same region between sugarcane varieties and their ancestral species can provide insights into the genomic complexity of sugarcane. The region evaluated in this work showed substantial differences among the genotypes studied, such as gene duplications, loss of gene exons, pseudogenization, gene inversions, gene deletions and insertions. For example, gene 25 (similar to alpha-amylase—AMY—Supplementary Table 2) is duplicated in tandem in sorghum and in R570, but in four IACSP93-3046 haplotypes, it is present in a single copy (a gap exists in the region SP80-3280). The sequences of genes 53, 54, and 55 (Supplementary Table 2) are duplicated in tandem in BAC Shy141H03 of IACSP93-3046 (Fig. 1 ), but they are not duplicated in sorghum and are not present in the recovered SP80-3280 haplotypes or in any of the alleles of the S. spontaneum genome. In addition to gene duplications, gene inversions were detected in the orthologous region between sorghum and all the Saccharum accessions evaluated (Fig. 2 ), which suggests that both inversions occurred after sorghum–sugarcane divergence. Overall, when inversions do not significantly disrupt the gene balance of an organism, the direct consequences tend to be minimal. Documented cases exist where inversion results in pseudogenization or even deletion of one of the genes [ 69 , 70 ]. In BAC Shy411A07 of the IACSP93-3046 variety, gene 11 (Supplementary Table 2) was absent, yet the remaining genes (12 and 13—Supplementary Table 2) indicated that an inversion occurred. Fragments of Harbinger-type (HARB) repetitive elements were found near pseudogenes 12 and 13 (Supplementary Table 2). HARB transposons are classified as class II transposable elements (TEs) that carry out the cleavage and transfer of single DNA strands mediated by transposases [ 69 , 70 ]. The presence of these HARB transposons suggests a possible relationship between these elements and these inversions, which were present in all the examined varieties, especially with the probable pseudogenization of genes 12 and 13 (Supplementary Table 2). The process of cleavage followed by fusion may have led to the deletion of bases, resulting in the truncation of genes and, consequently, the loss of their functions. In the SP80-3280 variety, gene 13 (Supplementary Table 2) contains a single exon spanning 2,682 base pairs. On the other hand, gene 12 (Supplementary Table 2) maintains two introns, even in its pseudogenized state, and in this case, it is situated between two TEs, similar to the HARB type (BAC Shy260G24). In BAC Shy492F12, gene 12 (Supplementary Table 2) is also close to a HARB-type TE flanking the last exon. In this case, gene 12 (Supplementary Table 2) presents characteristics indicative of a functional gene. The gene had different CDS base pair compositions among the haplotypes but was always between 1347 and 1488 bp. Additionally, gene 11 (Supplementary Table 2) retained a single intron, with a length ranging between 1,200 and 1,209 bp. However, neither variation was detected in sorghum, suggesting that it might be a unique characteristic of the Saccharum genus. Gene 11 on chromosome Sspon2B of S. spontaneum (Supplementary Table 2) contains a single exon. In a haplotype of the variety IACSP93-3046, represented by BAC Shy112C03, a gene whose ortholog in sorghum is not found in the QTL studied was detected. Notably, this gene is similar to the two sorghum genes Sobic.002G135950 and Sobic.002G195033. These sorghum genes have 91% sequence identity, and both have a zinc finger domain. The probable orthologous gene in the IACSP93-3046 variety is inserted in a retrotransposon similar to Copia22-ZM_I/LTR. Interestingly, this gene has all the characteristic features of being a functional gene, even when it is inserted into a TE. One possible explanation for this insertion is that the gene was cotransported with the retrotransposon. As Class II TEs, they can replicate a copy of themselves, which is subsequently inserted into different genomic regions. As such, this haplotype is highly likely to be a copy of the gene. The presence of a TE within an expressed gene (CENP-C) in sugarcane has been previously described [ 45 ], demonstrating that the proximity or overlap of TEs and genes does not hinder the function of the gene, at least in sugarcane. This gene, which is specific to the IACSP93-3046 haplotype (BAC Shy112C03), has a zinc finger domain; in plants, proteins featuring this domain are transcription factors (TFs) related to the control of cell division in totipotent tissues (petunias), histone–DNA binding (wheat), leaf budding (Chinese cabbage), soil salinity tolerance (Arabidopsis) and carbon metabolism (potato) [ 71 ]. This gene has also been detected in the orthologous region of the S. spontaneum chromosome Sspon2B but as a gene fragment. In IACSP93-3046, the gene is located between genes 16 and 17 (Supplementary Table 2) in a reverse orientation, and in Sspon2B, it is located between genes 39 and 41 (Supplementary Table 2), with gene 40 (Supplementary Table 2) being inserted into another fragment of the orthologous region in a strand orientation. This gene could also have been transposed with a TE, as possibly occurred with the hybrid. Importantly, S. spontaneum is a wild species that has been evolving under the pressure of natural selection, without the same level of human interference that fully domesticated plants undergo, as is the case with modern sugarcane cultivars—commercial hybrids. Despite such variability, we can observe the presence of potential genomic structure characteristics of S. spontaneum in commercial hybrids, such as inversions 11–13 (Supplementary Table 2) and 34–35 (Supplementary Table 2), which are present in at least three of the four alleles and are also present in all recovered haplotypes of the SP80-3280 and IACSP94-3046 varieties, where these inversions can be observed, as well as in the R570 variety [ 3 ]. The orthologous regions in the hybrid varieties appear to be more similar to those in sorghum than to those in S. spontaneum . Some fundamental characteristics are shared, such as synteny. However, differences such as inversions, duplications, insertions of orthologous genes from the same genomic region and even from sequences that are similar to genes from sorghum chromosomes other than SBI-02, possible pseudogenization and translocation were detected. However, this finding is not surprising considering that the chromosomes originating from S. spontaneum found in hybrids constitute only 10% to 20% of the chromosomes of modern hybrids [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 ]. Furthermore, wild species such as S. spontaneum have been subjected to natural selection pressure, resulting in a high level of expected heterozygosity for wild plants. While wild species have evolved naturally, commercial varieties have been selected and improved over the past 120 years to meet human needs [ 72 ], which has led to substantial genomic differences between them. Investigation of genes involved in sugar accumulation Among the 51 studied genes, 17 were annotated as genes associated with tolerance or response to stress (genes 01, 04, 11, 12, 13, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 41, and 57—Supplementary Table 2). The period when sugarcane accumulates sucrose in its stems coincides with the dry and high luminosity period in a significant portion of the crops. During this period, leaves gradually fall, while sugar accumulates in culms [ 73 ]. Sucrose accumulation occurs in response to stressful conditions [ 74 ]. Therefore, a connection may exist between sucrose accumulation in sugarcane and genes related to abiotic stress. Considering the characteristics of the crop, five genes related to the abscisic acid (ABA) response were also observed (genes 20, 23, 32, 33 and 37—Supplementary Table 2). In addition to being a crucial hormone for the photosynthetic process by regulating stomatal closure and opening, ABA is highly responsive to stress, particularly water stress [ 75 ]. Leaf water potential and stomatal conductance are crucial factors for sugarcane to be able to produce carbohydrates that are converted into sucrose, transported to stalks, and subsequently accumulate [ 76 , 77 ]. In addition, five genes (genes 17, 18, 45, 46, and 47—Supplementary Table 2) belonging to the lipolytic enzyme GDXG family were detected. This enzyme family is characterized by two consensus sequences containing a histidine residue and a serine residue as putative active site residues [ 78 ]. In some genes encoding these enzymes, the alpha/beta hydrolase (ABH) domain, which is known to play a role in catalyzing the cleavage of carbon double bonds and decarboxylation, may be present [ 79 ]. Additionally, six genes (8, 49, 50, 52, 53, and 54—Supplementary Table 2) containing the ABH domain but belonging to the carboxylesterase (CXE) family were identified, five of which are sequential. The specificities of genes within the same family characterized by shared domains may vary significantly, necessitating further exploration of the biological roles of each gene. Notably, a group of genes sharing closely related domains and families on the same chromosome, even sequentially, may suggest a potential origin through duplication events that diverged during evolution into distinct genes while maintaining some similarity [ 80 ]. Candidate genes for sugar accumulation The ERF109 (gene 26—Supplementary Table 2), ABA 8' OH (gene 23—Supplementary Table 2), and POP (gene 01—Supplementary Table 2) genes are candidates for sucrose accumulation in sugarcane, considering that sugarcane needs soil with low humidity, approximately 15%, for greater sugar accumulation [ 81 ]. Gene 26 (Supplementary Table 2) is similar to ERF109, an ethylene-responsive TF. ERF109 expression is related to anthocyanin accumulation in apples, as ERF109 directly binds to the promoters of anthocyanin synthesis genes [ 82 ]. Jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation in plant wounds also activates the expression of ERF109. ERF109 induces the biosynthesis of the auxin protein ASA1, which aids in the process of secondary root formation mediated by JA-dependent ERF109 signaling [ 83 ]. In sugarcane, more than 16,000 genes have been identified as potential targets regulated by ERF109, indicating that ERF109 has a broad influence on gene expression. Functions are diverse and include metabolic activities such as Rubisco activity, triggering the biosynthesis of hormones such as cytokinins, and gibberellin-mediated responses [ 84 ]. ERF109 was not expressed in the internodes of any of the analyzed sugar-accumulating plants or in the younger internodes of S. spontaneum , but significant expression was detected in its older internodes. In transgenic lemon, the overexpression of ERF109 causes global reprogramming of plant expression [ 85 ]. ERF109 acts as a stress-responsive TF; however, the proposed role of this gene in sugar accumulation, given its promiscuity, requires further investigation. Proline-dependent genes Genes 01 and 23 (Supplementary Table 2) are related to proline accumulation. Proline is an amino acid with a unique configuration, restricting its free rotation at the α-carbon because the nitrogen and α-carbon are combined in a pyrrolidine ring. This structure contributes to the rigidity of proteins containing proline residues and requires specific enzymes, including POP, for cleavage [ 86 ]. Enzymes that specifically cleave proline are known to be involved in proline accumulation in the cytosol of plant cells. This accumulation is essential for the adaptive response of plants to adverse situations [ 87 ]. Plants accumulate proline to maintain cellular homeostasis, aid in water absorption, and better adapt to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and heavy metals. These adverse conditions lead to the excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequences such as lipid peroxidation, increased osmolyte levels, and activation of antioxidant systems [ 31 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 91 – 92 ]. As such, proline accumulation enhances adaptive responses in plants. Plants may increase proline biosynthesis in response to the above conditions or reuse presynthesized proline from proteins and peptides that are not essential [ 87 ]. The exogenous application of proline in maize has been reported to increase sugar, oil, moisture, and protein levels in seeds under drought conditions [ 90 , 93 ]. In sugarcane, the efficiency of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance is specifically related to sucrose accumulation in stalks [ 94 ]. In mature plants, the relationship between leaves as a sugar source and other organs, including internodes, is critical for the regulation of photosynthesis rates and sucrose accumulation in stalks [ 74 ]. Proline interacts with other metabolites, including soluble sugars. The phenomenon of accumulated proline interacting with sucrose, for example, to adjust the osmotic balance during salt stress, has been reported [ 90 , 91 – 92 , 95 ]. However, whether this interaction could be driven by other physiological changes in different plants in response to different stimuli remains unclear. Although the connection between stress and plants has been clarified, much still needs to be elucidated. In sugarcane, the accumulation of sucrose and starch in leaves coincides with a reduction in photosynthetic rates, which occurs during low water availability [ 73 ]. Gene 23 (Supplementary Table 2), which shares similarities with ABA 8’-hydroxylase enzymes from the cytochrome P450 family, converts ABA into 8’-hydroxy ABA and then into phaseic acid [ 96 ], regulating ABA metabolism and influencing plant responses to environmental stress and development, including germination, root growth, and fruit maturation [ 97 ]. Inhibition of this enzyme affects the balance of processes involving ABA [ 97 ], such as stomatal closure in response to water, salt, and thermal stresses. Studies in grapes have shown that inhibiting ABA 8’-hydroxylase results in reduced leaf water potential and stomatal conductance [ 98 ], accompanied by proline accumulation in leaves and the growth of adventitious roots [ 98 ]. In sugar-accumulating plants, ABA 8’-hydroxylase is virtually not expressed, suggesting a potential role for ABA regulation in sugar storage tissues (Fig. 3 — genes 13,240–23). The dry climate during the sugar accumulation period in sugarcane, as observed during sample collection, indicates potential moderate water stress. Under water stress conditions, the sugarcane genotypes with the most efficient sugar accumulation tend to maintain greater stomatal conductance [ 99 ]. The lack of expression of the ABA catabolic gene suggested that the need for stomatal conductance regulation in these plants may be linked to maintaining open stomata. Additionally, in grapes, inhibition of the ABA 8’-hydroxylase gene improves tolerance to dehydration and promotes adventitious root formation, indicating an effective strategy for coping with water stress. Gene 23 was not expressed in the internodes (gene 13240–23—Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the plant may use this strategy to improve its tolerance to a potential water deficit. Gene 01 (Supplementary Table 2) shares similarities with POP, which belongs to the serine protease family (clan SC, family S9) that includes various peptidases. POP is a cytoplasmic enzyme that hydrolyzes peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of proline residues [ 100 , 101 ]. The enzyme's three-dimensional structure allows for the postproline cleavage of peptides containing up to 30 amino acid residues [ 100 , 101 ]. Post- or preproline-cleaving enzymes can belong to different peptidase families, including aminopeptidases, endopeptidases, or oligopeptidases (PAP/PEP/POP). The most common domain in family S9 is a substrate-limiting β-propeller domain preventing unwanted digestion, while the α/β hydrolase domain catalyzes the reaction at the carboxy terminus of proline residues [ 101 ]. POP is a ubiquitous protein with a well-established structure and mechanism of action. However, its biological role in plants has not been fully elucidated. Increased POP expression in plants is known to be associated with tolerance to various types of abiotic stresses [ 100 , 102 , 103 ]. In flax, this phenomenon seems to be related to a fundamental mechanism for embryo growth in seeds [ 100 ]. In coffee, POP overexpression is linked to a significant increase in the number of branches in transgenic plants [ 102 ]. Other peptidases that hydrolyze with proline specificity are related to plant development, such as pollen development [ 89 ], flowering, increased ABA activity, protection of photosynthetic activity during salt stress, elimination of reactive oxygen species, and overall osmotic potential adjustment [ 90 ]. Gene 01 is a DEG (Table 1 ) that is highly expressed in the internodes of the sampled sugar-accumulating plants (SP80-3280 and IACSP93-3046 varieties, and S. officinarum ) and expressed at significantly lower levels in S. spontaneum , a sugar-nonaccumulating sugarcane species known for its resistance to various stress types. Although POP is related to stress resistance and tolerance, more evidence suggests that this gene is involved in this process. Proline-cleaving enzymes are expressed when a plant needs to accumulate proline, a phenomenon that usually occurs when the plant requires osmotic regulation due to stresses such as water and salinity stress. Proline can also bind to soluble sugars such as sucrose when the homeostasis of plant cells must be regulated. Gene 01 has three first neighbors, one of which possesses the ENTH domain—a lipid-binding region crucial for clathrin-coated vesicle formation, endocytosis at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and vacuolar transport. This gene could play a role in the transport of proline and sucrose, given its correlation with POP. Conclusions This study examined the genomic architecture of a specific region in two sugarcane cultivars, validating sorghum as a key reference genome for identifying candidate genes for quantitative traits. Using a method that integrated comparative genomic analysis, RNA-seq data, and a literature review, three candidate genes involved in sugar accumulation were identified: ERF-109, ABA 8’OH, and POP. ERF-109, a versatile transcription factor, is known to be involved in metabolic processes and stress resistance. This study revealed that it potentially influences sugar accumulation. ABA 8’OH and POP are linked to proline accumulation, which is associated with stress responses and sucrose binding, indicating a possible association between sucrose and proline accumulation. This integrative method is recommended for identifying new candidate genes for sugar accumulation and other traits in sugarcane, with the aim of developing cultivars with relatively high sugar contents. We encourage more research on these three genes, believing that we can learn more about the intricate process of storing and accumulating sugar in sugarcane."
