          "Sugarcane is known for its high biomass yield and accounts for 10–12% of all carbohydrates produced worldwide ( FAO, 1995 ). Because of sugarcane’s extraordinarily high yield and established farming and processing technologies, sugarcane biomass is a leading candidate as a bioenergy and bioproduct feedstock ( O'Hara and Mundree, 2016; Botha and Moore, 2014 ).",
          "Sugarcane biomass is present within two major pools, soluble sugars and non-soluble complex carbohydrates. Soluble sugars are present mainly in the form of sucrose, which represents up to 35% of the photosynthetically fixed carbon (C) in the culm of modern commercial sugarcane varieties ( Arruda, 2012; Moore, 1995 ). The sucrose content in the sugarcane culm ranges from 14 to 42% of the dry weight ( Whittaker and Botha, 1997; Lingle, 1999 ). As the internode cells stop elongating, sucrose accumulation increases in the maturing internodes, followed by a major increase in cell-wall thickening and lignification ( Lingle, 1999; Botha and Black, 2000 ). The other 65% of the fixed C in sugarcane plants is primarily stored as complex carbohydrates, mainly cellulose and hemicellulose ( Matsuoka et al., 2009 ). Most of the non-soluble carbohydrates are located in the cell-wall. The cell-wall of sugarcane comprises glucan, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractives, with the reported values for these components ranging between 38–49%, 25–31%, 17–24% and 1.6–7.5% respectively ( Masarin et al., 2011; Souza, 2012 ).",
          "The depression of sugar prices over the past decade ( FAS Sugar, 2019 ), has led to numerous calls for the industry to diversify into the production of biofuels and other bioproducts ( Brumbley et al., 2002; Renouf et al., 2013; Windle and Rolfe, 2005 ). In addition, unlike sucrose production, the production of biofuel and bioproducts can use both the soluble and insoluble components of sugarcane as a feedstock ( O'Hara and Mundree, 2016 ). However, the various soluble and non-soluble biomass compounds have different treatment requirements before they can be used as a feedstock. The soluble component can be converted immediately, whereas, in the insoluble component requires chemical, heat or mechanical pre-treatment is required, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis ( de Souza et al., 2013 ). Traditionally, sugarcane breeding programmes have focused solely on increasing sucrose content in the culm. However, because both soluble and insoluble fractions can be used, future breeding efforts must be focused on optimising the ratios of both ( de Morais et al., ; Hoang et al., ).",
          "The transition from modern sugarcane varieties grown for optimal sucrose content to such a system would require: increased in sink strength by changing the partitioning and sink demand ( Botha, 2018; Uys et al., 2007 ), and enhanced source efficiency via the removal feedback inhibition on source metabolism ( Watt et al., 2013; McCormick et al., 2009; Wang, 2013 ). These changes rely on changes in C partitioning in the source and sink. Despite the clear importance of C partitioning in the continual improvement of sugarcane, understanding of the underlying control mechanisms is limited. The best-studied examples relate to internode maturation ( Whittaker and Botha, 1997; Lingle and Thomson, 2012; Brienzo et al., 2016 ).",
          "The major organs of sugarcane use C in distinctly different ways, thus leading to differing ratios of insoluble and soluble compounds ( de Souza et al., 2013; Hodgson-Kratky et al., 2019; Mason, 2020 ). Furthermore, differences in C partitioning are also present during organ maturation, which has been well defined in the sugarcane stem ( Whittaker and Botha, 1997; Lingle and Thomson, 2012; Brienzo et al., 2016 ). One such study has observed elevated gene expression associated with sucrose cleavage from UDP-glucose in immature internodes, thus presumably permitting C movement into the cell-wall; in contrast, in mature internodes undergoing higher degrees of sucrose filling, genes associated with the opposite reaction of UDP-glucose to sucrose synthesis are upregulated ( Botha and Black, 2000 ). In several related studies, genes associated with C provision to the cell-wall have also been found to be downregulated in mature internodal tissue ( Hoang et al., 2017; Thirugnanasambandam et al., 2019; Casu et al., 2015 ).",
          "Modern high throughput technologies such as next-generation sequencing provide platforms to broadly examine differences in gene expression in among plant organs with differing maturities ( Schuster, 2008; Ansorge, 2009; Metzker, 2010 ). In this study, we used mature sugarcane leaves (dedicated source tissue), young internodes (sink tissue in which the bulk of C goes to cellulose, hemicellulose, protein synthesis and respiration ( Botha, 2018 ), mature internodes (sink tissue where respiration is limited and C will goes toward sucrose storage ( Botha, 2018; Bindon and Botha, 2002 ) and root tissue (where the bulk of C is likely to flow toward respiration and protein synthesis) to investigate the relationship between C partitioning and transcript expression, and to characterise important genes/transcripts that may have utility from a breeding perspective. The knowledge gained from this study may support efforts to develop sugarcane with biomass composition better suited to different end uses."

Sample material was provided by Sugar Research Australia (SRA), and was grown at their station in Brandon, Queensland, Australia. Leaf and internode samples of both genotypes were collected from 9-month-old commercial stands. Field grown material contained between 24 or 25 internodes, at an average height of 2.7 m, from the base of the stem to the top of the leaf roll. Root samples of Q208 and KQ228 were obtained from 3-month-old research plants in ‘soft’ above-ground pots. The 3-month-old plants contained nine internodes at an average height of 50 cm. All samples were collected in triplicate. For simplicity, analysis of the Q208 genotype is not shown in the main text. The purpose of the additional genotypic analyses was to validate the results of the KQ228 genotype. Results from the transcriptomic analyses of both genotypes indicated high similarities between genotypes. Supplementary material is available in Supplementary data file 1, which contains the parallel analysis of the Q208 genotype ( SRA, 2016 )."

All sample collection occurred between 10 am and 2 pm to minimise the potential effects of diurnal fluctuations in the transcriptome ( Thirugnanasambandam et al., 2017 ). Root material was collected 20 cm away from the base of the stem. Roots were removed from the pots, washed with a fine mist spray nozzle and contact dried with a paper towel before snap freezing. Roots were frozen within 30 s after removal from soil. Leaf material was obtained from the 1st and 5th leaves with visible dewlaps. Internodes were numbered according to the schematic proposed by McCormick et al. ( McCormick et al., 2006 ). Immature internode (labelled as top internode, TI) material was collected from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th internodes. Mid-range mature internode (labelled as middle internode, MI) samples were collected from the 11th, 12th and 13th internodes. Bottom-range mature internode (labelled as bottom internode, BI) material was collected from the 21st, 22nd and 23rd internodes. Internode samples were collected as small 0.5 cm (height) disks, which were processed into small cubes before snap freezing. Hereafter, these samples are referred to as TI, MI, BI, 1st visible dewlap leaf (L1), 5th visible dewlap leaf (L5) and root (R)."

RNA extraction was conducted with a combined TRIzol kit and RNeasy Plant mini kit, as previously described in ( Furtado, 2014 ). This method involve an initial guanidium thiocyanate-phenol–chloroform extraction ( Chomczynski and Sacchi, 2006 ), which is followed by filtration and resuspension of the RNA solution with a Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Cat# 74903, Qiagen, USA). RNA quantity, quality and integrity were initially measured with a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). Final quality control before submission for sequencing was completed with an Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 (used with an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit: Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All internode and root samples had RNA integrity number (RIN) values > 8.2 ( Supplementary Data File 3 Table S6). Leaf samples had significantly lower RIN values of > 6.4 ( Supplementary data file 3 Table S6). The lower RIN values observed in the leaf material were determined to be due to the presence of additional chloroplast rRNA peaks in the Bioanalyser profile, which resulted in altered RIN and rRNA 26S/18S ratios ( Babu and Gassmann, 2011 ) ( Supplementary Data File 3 Figure S13 ). In total, 6 root, 12 leaf and 54 internode samples were processed. Internode samples were collected in internodal regions of three samples, which were bulked after extraction. After bulking, a total of 18 RNA samples (9 internode, 6 leaf and 3 root samples) were examined per genotype."

              "The pipeline used to profile the transcriptome of the multiple samples in this experiment was based on the protocol ‘Expression Analysis using RNA-seq’ by QIAGEN bioinformatics ( QIAGEN, 2017 ) in the CLC-GWB. CLC-GWB produces transcript profiles and differential expression analysis without a reference genome guiding transcript allocation. The RNA-seq package (v. 2.15) used in CLC is based on QIAGEN’s proprietary EM estimation algorithm, which is inspired by the RSEM and eXpress methods. The abundance of transcripts was iteratively estimated whilst reads were assigned to transcripts according to the abundance ( QIAGEN, 2018 ). The abundance of each isoform was estimated by alignment of the Illumina RNA-seq data of each sample to the sugarcane reference transcriptome using the RNA-seq analysis function (Navigation: Toolbox > RNA-seq analysis > RNA-seq analysis; settings presented in Supplementary data file 3 Figure S14 ). CLC-GWB’s RNA-seq package builds reads tracks aligned to their respective transcripts, and a table of raw read counts and normalised expression values. Normalised expression values include Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM) and Transcripts Per Million reads (TPM). The read count profile for each sample was parsed manually using the table filtering system into the following groups; >0–0.3, 0.3–1, 1–5, 5–10, 10–100 and >100, on the basis of TPM expression values. The same filtering system was used to extract lists of highly expressed genes (TPM ≥ 500) from each sample for downstream annotation with Blast2Go. To identify differentially expressed transcripts, we used the differential expression (DE) for the RNA-seq data analysis function in CLC-GWB (Navigation: Toolbox > RNA-seq analysis > Differential Expression for RNA-seq data). The DE analysis in CLC-GWB uses multi-factorial statistics based on a negative binomial model (generalised linear model). It also considers the unbalanced sequencing depth of each sample, which facilitates the identification of differentially expressed genes despite highly variable ranges of data ( QIAGEN, 2018 ). Finally, it produces read tracks and a differential gene expression (DGE) table containing fold changes (log 2 and basic fold changes), between conditions as well as the statistical probabilities of transcript comparisons (p-value, Bonferroni and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value)."

Both analyses were performed with the SUGIT transcriptome as the background. Only enriched GO terms and pathways with an FDR-corrected p-value ≤ 0.05 were used to compare among the DE transcript sets.

The result indicated high relatedness between all leaves as well as roots. Far more variability was observed in the internodes, particularly those of the BI samples, and the MI and TI samples clustered relatively closely. Two BI samples did not cluster close to the MI and TI cluster. This finding is likely to indicate the BI samples to have reached a level of dormancy/inactivity expected of very mature tissues, as growth and sucrose filling has been completed ( Lingle and Thomson, 2012 ).

Between the immature internodes (TI) and mature internodes, larger transcriptional differences were observed. Between leaves (L1 and L5), relatively small transcriptional differences were observed. Larger transcriptional differences were observed in comparisons between leaves and internodes. In this comparison group, the largest transcriptional differences were observed between the immature internodes and both leaves. Larger differences were also observed between the mature internodes and leaves. The larger disparity observed for the upregulated and downregulated transcripts between the leaves and the BI internodal sample might have been explained by the variability between the BI RNA-seq replicates (PCA in Fig. 1 a ) leading to fewer significantly upregulated transcripts. The root samples used in this study were from younger plants (3-months-old) than the other samples, which were all sampled at 9-months. Therefore, the root samples might have contained more immature cells than a 9-month-old plant samples. A high degree of transcriptional difference was observed between root and internodes of all maturities. Differences in transcription were highest between the roots and leaves, in contrast to all other comparisons between organs. Because of the transcriptional similarity of some samples (L1 and L5 and MI and BI) and for simplicity of analysis, we chose four DGE comparisons comparing the major organ types and the internodes of differing maturity for downstream analyses (details in Supplementary data file 2 Table S4).",

The greatest difference in transcript assignment was observed in BINs 3, 18, 19, 20 and 21, in favour of immature internodes, which were related to carbohydrate metabolism, structural (cell-wall and cytoskeleton) and protein-related processes ( Fig. 4 a) . The BIN assignment comparison between L5 and R showed a 25-fold increase in the number of photosynthetic (BIN 1) transcripts with higher expression in the leaf tissue.

Several transcripts associated with lignin biosynthesis also had higher expression in the immature internodes. However, some dirigent protein-associated transcripts did have higher expression in the mature internode. Pathway analysis of the leaf tissue and the immature internode comparison indicated mostly higher expression of transcripts relating to cell-wall deposition (UDP-glucose, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin synthesis, and the myo- inositol pathway), and fructose phosphorylation in the immature internode (comparison No. 2, Fig. 5 ) . A small number of cellulose synthase transcripts did have higher expression in leaves. Gluconeogenesis, starch synthesis/degradation (syn/deg), and the trehalose-6-phosphate pool-related transcripts exhibited higher expression in leaves. Transcripts associated with PPP, glycolysis, sugar transport, the shikimate pathway and sucrose phosphate synthase activity had large numbers of transcripts with higher expression in both the leaf and immature internode. The root vs. leaf comparison (comparison No. 3, Fig. 5 ) revealed similar trends of gene expression to those in the immature internode vs. leaf comparison. However, in most cases, the number of DE transcripts was higher at most points in the pathway, particularly in the myo- inositol pathway and starch syn/deg. The only major differences were observed for the fructokinase and hexokinase related transcripts which displayed mostly higher expression the root tissue. In the immature internode vs. root comparison, higher expression was observed in transcripts associated with UDP-glucose, lignin, phenylalanine, hemicellulose synthesis, sucrose hydrolysis (invertase), fructose and glucose phosphorylation, the myo- inositol pathway, trehalose-6-phosphate pool, and the PPP (comparison No. 4, Fig. 5 ) . The only point in the pathway where the immature internode had a larger number of transcripts with higher expression was in the starch syn/deg pathway. An equal number of transcripts associated with cellulose synthase activity had higher expression in both TI and R samples."

              "The expression of transcripts associated with C partitioning showed distinct differences favouring cell-wall, protein and secondary metabolite synthesis and respiration in immature internodes, as well as sucrose storage in mature internodes, as indicated in several previous studies ( Botha and Black, 2000; Hoang et al., 2017; Thirugnanasambandam et al., 2019; Bindon and Botha, 2002; Casu et al., 2007 ). This notion was mostly supported by our data ; as evidenced by the elevated levels of transcription, particularly in the cell-wall, carbohydrate metabolism and respiratory-related transcripts in the immature internode compared with those in mature source and sink samples. In the focused pathway analysis, most DE transcripts were associated with the direct synthesis of UDP-glucose from sucrose, or consumption into cellulose and hemicellulosic precursors, which were higher in immature internodes. Unsurprisingly, most transcripts were associated with UDP-glucose, the precursor of major cell-wall components, thus suggesting the control of the UDP-glucose pool is central to how C will be partitioned in internodes ( Hoang et al., 2017 ). Wai et al. (2017) have indicated the importance of UDP-glucose synthesis from sucrose in novel Saccharum hybrids, deducing a link between rapid UDP-glucose synthesis & sucrose conversion and high biomass accumulation ( Wai et al., 2017 ). This observation revealed the close relationship between hexose allocation and cell-wall biosynthesis. The lack of elevated expression in sucrose synthetic genes in mature internodes contradicts the enzymatic activity indicated in previous studies ( Botha and Black, 2000; Pan et al., 2009; Rae et al., 2005; Casu, 2003 ). This observation may suggest that competition for sucrose and UDP-glucose by invertase, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGD), cellulose synthase (CesA), and sucrose synthase (SuSy) (UDP-forming) enzymes may be key to the lower sucrose levels in immature internodal tissues, as previously implied ( Bindon and Botha, 2002 ), rather than enhanced competition for UDP-glucose and fructose-6-phosphate due to the activity of the sucrose synthesising enzyme sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) in mature internodes. Genes/transcripts associated with the UGD, CesA and SuSy enzymes have also been found to have significantly higher expression in immature internodes in a prior study ( Hoang et al., 2017 ). The lack of difference between the mature internode BI and MI samples, as indicated by the very few DE genes, suggested the expression levels remained stable following tissue maturity, and throughout sucrose filling. In this study, similar transcriptional profiles observed between internodes of different maturity, suggested that transcriptional changes in select sets of genes influence changes in the direction of C partitioning. This finding contrasts with the large transcriptional differences observed between the major organ types (leaves, internodes and root). An overview is provided in Fig. 6 ."

              "On the basis of the compositional analysis of roots in Mason et al. ( Mason, 2020 ), the bulk of C in roots is probably used in respiration, and protein and cell-wall synthesis, via the cleavage/hydrolysis of imported sucrose ( Mason, 2020 ). Overall, the higher expression of transcripts associated with the aforementioned pools, in comparison to leaf and storage sinks, is consistent with this supposition. Sugarcane root and immature internodes use C in similar ways, in which the C imported from source organs is not stored as sucrose, as is the case in mature internodes (meristematic sinks) ( Wang, 2013 ). However, the previously uncharacterised root system was shown to have distinctly different transcriptional activity associated with C partitioning. Transcripts associated with C utilisation involving sucrose degradation into UDP-glucose, fructose, glucose, lignin and hemicellulose synthesis had higher expression in roots than in immature internodes. Interestingly, evidence of enhanced activity was observed within the alternate hemicellulose synthetic pathway, the myo- inositol pathway ( Endres and Tenhaken, 2011 ). Elevated concentrations of the hemicellulosic monomers galactose and arabinose have been reported in sugarcane roots ( Mason, 2020 ) and may be associated with the higher expression of some transcripts associated with hemicellulose synthesis in roots. Furthermore, in the same study, the lignin content was significantly higher in roots, in line with the heightened expression of transcripts related to lignin biosynthesis. An overview is provided in Fig. 6 ."

              "Leaves the primary source organs of plants. Throughout their lifecycle they are a net exporter of C, via the fixation of atmospheric C as part of the photosynthetic reaction ( McCormick et al., 2006 ). Leaves contain very low levels of sugars, as a result of active exportation of C from this tissue, and high levels of unassigned mass, which has been stipulated to be primarily protein, as a result of the presence of the photosynthetic machinery ( Mason, 2020 ). Transcript expression leading to cell-wall related pools, i.e., lignin, hemicellulose, cellulose respiratory, and some protein synthetic pools was lower than that of meristematic sinks. Several transcripts associated with the glycolytic pathway that had higher expression in leaves suggested a smaller but still significant requirement for C for protein and respiratory pools, as reported by another study ( van der Merwe et al., 2010 ). As much as 80% of C fixed by source organs is transported out; however, most of the other 20% is likely to be used in the aforementioned pools. In source tissues, transcripts associated with sucrose synthesis from UDP-glucose and hexose phosphates displayed elevated expression, probably indicating the synthesis of sucrose from photosynthesis via the triose-phosphate pool ( Wang et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, the lower expression of enzymes associated with fructose 1,6 biphosphate (F1,6BP) synthesis in leaves ( Supplementary Data File 2 Figure S12 ), suggested a lower degree of inhibition of SPS enzyme function, which would further enhance the likelihood of elevated activity of sucrose synthesis in this tissue ( Groenewald and Botha, 2008 ). Interestingly, mature internodes did not display the same degree of low expression of transcripts associated with F1,6BP synthesis as leaves. This finding was unexpected, because the synthesis of F1,6BP is considered a potential key factor in controlling and minimising sucrose accumulation in immature internodes, via the regulation of hexose phosphates to triose phosphates ( van der Merwe et al., 2010 ). This is further supported by a previous kinetic analysis of sucrose and F1,6BP enzymes, which indicated that a specific SuSy enzyme has the most pronounced effect on sucrose synthesis and storage in mature internodes ( Uys et al., 2007 ). This result may suggest that the diminished expression of transcripts related to F1,6BP synthesis plays more of a key role in the promotion of sucrose synthesis in source tissues than in storage sinks. In contrast, the opposite is likely to be true for mature internodes. The lower expression of solute transporters than that in immature sink tissues, specifically sucrose transporters, was unexpected, particularly because leaf tissues actively transport>80% of fixed C as sucrose ( Kalt-Torres et al., 1987 ). Previous characterisations of sucrose transporters (specifically SUT), have been found to have higher expression in leaves and mature internodes ( Rae et al., 2005; Rae et al., 2005 ).

              "Overall, in the results from previous compositional analyses, transcription closely aligned with differences in the overall biomass makeup of insoluble and soluble components. Transcript expression in both active source samples (L1 and L5) displayed higher expression in photosynthetic transcripts and some protein and respiratory transcripts, and very low expression of most transcripts associated with cell-wall synthesis. Meristematic sinks, (R and TI) displayed significantly lower transcript expression relating to photosynthesis, and far higher expression of cell-wall related transcripts, particularly with respect to the source samples. Interestingly, transcription among the different meristematic sinks distinctly differed, a finding potentially associated with differences in composition. The comparison of the major organs of sugarcane in this study allows for enhanced assessment of the differences in transcriptional control of C partitioning throughout the sugarcane plant. The identification of contrasting transcription, relating to differences in C partitioning among the major organs of sugarcane, should provide a valuable resource for future research and manipulation of the variety of related pathways. Organ-specific transcription, such as the higher expression of cell-wall related transcripts in immature sinks, or the higher expression of sucrose synthetic transcripts in source organs, will enable closer analysis of the specific gene isoforms controlling these specific differences in C partitioning."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Sugarcane is known for its high biomass yield and accounts for 10–12% of all carbohydrates produced worldwide ( FAO, 1995 ). Because of sugarcane’s extraordinarily high yield and established farming and processing technologies, sugarcane biomass is a leading candidate as a bioenergy and bioproduct feedstock ( O'Hara and Mundree, 2016; Botha and Moore, 2014 ). Sugarcane biomass is present within two major pools, soluble sugars and non-soluble complex carbohydrates. Soluble sugars are present mainly in the form of sucrose, which represents up to 35% of the photosynthetically fixed carbon (C) in the culm of modern commercial sugarcane varieties ( Arruda, 2012; Moore, 1995 ). The sucrose content in the sugarcane culm ranges from 14 to 42% of the dry weight ( Whittaker and Botha, 1997; Lingle, 1999 ). As the internode cells stop elongating, sucrose accumulation increases in the maturing internodes, followed by a major increase in cell-wall thickening and lignification ( Lingle, 1999; Botha and Black, 2000 ). The other 65% of the fixed C in sugarcane plants is primarily stored as complex carbohydrates, mainly cellulose and hemicellulose ( Matsuoka et al., 2009 ). Most of the non-soluble carbohydrates are located in the cell-wall. The cell-wall of sugarcane comprises glucan, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractives, with the reported values for these components ranging between 38–49%, 25–31%, 17–24% and 1.6–7.5% respectively ( Masarin et al., 2011; Souza, 2012 ). The depression of sugar prices over the past decade ( FAS Sugar, 2019 ), has led to numerous calls for the industry to diversify into the production of biofuels and other bioproducts ( Brumbley et al., 2002; Renouf et al., 2013; Windle and Rolfe, 2005 ). In addition, unlike sucrose production, the production of biofuel and bioproducts can use both the soluble and insoluble components of sugarcane as a feedstock ( O'Hara and Mundree, 2016 ). However, the various soluble and non-soluble biomass compounds have different treatment requirements before they can be used as a feedstock. The soluble component can be converted immediately, whereas, in the insoluble component requires chemical, heat or mechanical pre-treatment is required, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis ( de Souza et al., 2013 ). Traditionally, sugarcane breeding programmes have focused solely on increasing sucrose content in the culm. However, because both soluble and insoluble fractions can be used, future breeding efforts must be focused on optimising the ratios of both ( de Morais et al., ; Hoang et al., ). The transition from modern sugarcane varieties grown for optimal sucrose content to such a system would require: increased in sink strength by changing the partitioning and sink demand ( Botha, 2018; Uys et al., 2007 ), and enhanced source efficiency via the removal feedback inhibition on source metabolism ( Watt et al., 2013; McCormick et al., 2009; Wang, 2013 ). These changes rely on changes in C partitioning in the source and sink. Despite the clear importance of C partitioning in the continual improvement of sugarcane, understanding of the underlying control mechanisms is limited. The best-studied examples relate to internode maturation ( Whittaker and Botha, 1997; Lingle and Thomson, 2012; Brienzo et al., 2016 ). The major organs of sugarcane use C in distinctly different ways, thus leading to differing ratios of insoluble and soluble compounds ( de Souza et al., 2013; Hodgson-Kratky et al., 2019; Mason, 2020 ). Furthermore, differences in C partitioning are also present during organ maturation, which has been well defined in the sugarcane stem ( Whittaker and Botha, 1997; Lingle and Thomson, 2012; Brienzo et al., 2016 ). One such study has observed elevated gene expression associated with sucrose cleavage from UDP-glucose in immature internodes, thus presumably permitting C movement into the cell-wall; in contrast, in mature internodes undergoing higher degrees of sucrose filling, genes associated with the opposite reaction of UDP-glucose to sucrose synthesis are upregulated ( Botha and Black, 2000 ). In several related studies, genes associated with C provision to the cell-wall have also been found to be downregulated in mature internodal tissue ( Hoang et al., 2017; Thirugnanasambandam et al., 2019; Casu et al., 2015 ). Modern high throughput technologies such as next-generation sequencing provide platforms to broadly examine differences in gene expression in among plant organs with differing maturities ( Schuster, 2008; Ansorge, 2009; Metzker, 2010 ). In this study, we used mature sugarcane leaves (dedicated source tissue), young internodes (sink tissue in which the bulk of C goes to cellulose, hemicellulose, protein synthesis and respiration ( Botha, 2018 ), mature internodes (sink tissue where respiration is limited and C will goes toward sucrose storage ( Botha, 2018; Bindon and Botha, 2002 ) and root tissue (where the bulk of C is likely to flow toward respiration and protein synthesis) to investigate the relationship between C partitioning and transcript expression, and to characterise important genes/transcripts that may have utility from a breeding perspective. The knowledge gained from this study may support efforts to develop sugarcane with biomass composition better suited to different end uses. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant material The material used in this experiment was derived from two commercial sugarcane varieties, KQ228 and Q208. Sample material was provided by Sugar Research Australia (SRA), and was grown at their station in Brandon, Queensland, Australia. Leaf and internode samples of both genotypes were collected from 9-month-old commercial stands. Field grown material contained between 24 or 25 internodes, at an average height of 2.7 m, from the base of the stem to the top of the leaf roll. Root samples of Q208 and KQ228 were obtained from 3-month-old research plants in ‘soft’ above-ground pots. The 3-month-old plants contained nine internodes at an average height of 50 cm. All samples were collected in triplicate. For simplicity, analysis of the Q208 genotype is not shown in the main text. The purpose of the additional genotypic analyses was to validate the results of the KQ228 genotype. Results from the transcriptomic analyses of both genotypes indicated high similarities between genotypes. Supplementary material is available in Supplementary data file 1, which contains the parallel analysis of the Q208 genotype ( SRA, 2016 ). 2.2 Sugarcane material collection All samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 1 min after excision, placed on dry ice during transit and kept in a −80 °C freezer before pulverisation. All sample collection occurred between 10 am and 2 pm to minimise the potential effects of diurnal fluctuations in the transcriptome ( Thirugnanasambandam et al., 2017 ). Root material was collected 20 cm away from the base of the stem. Roots were removed from the pots, washed with a fine mist spray nozzle and contact dried with a paper towel before snap freezing. Roots were frozen within 30 s after removal from soil. Leaf material was obtained from the 1st and 5th leaves with visible dewlaps. Internodes were numbered according to the schematic proposed by McCormick et al. ( McCormick et al., 2006 ). Immature internode (labelled as top internode, TI) material was collected from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th internodes. Mid-range mature internode (labelled as middle internode, MI) samples were collected from the 11th, 12th and 13th internodes. Bottom-range mature internode (labelled as bottom internode, BI) material was collected from the 21st, 22nd and 23rd internodes. Internode samples were collected as small 0.5 cm (height) disks, which were processed into small cubes before snap freezing. Hereafter, these samples are referred to as TI, MI, BI, 1st visible dewlap leaf (L1), 5th visible dewlap leaf (L5) and root (R). 2.3 RNA extraction Before RNA extraction samples were homogenised in cryogenic conditions with a Retsch TissueLyser™ II (Retsch, Haan, Germany) at a frequency of 30/S for 1 min and 30 s. RNA extraction was conducted with a combined TRIzol kit and RNeasy Plant mini kit, as previously described in ( Furtado, 2014 ). This method involve an initial guanidium thiocyanate-phenol–chloroform extraction ( Chomczynski and Sacchi, 2006 ), which is followed by filtration and resuspension of the RNA solution with a Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Cat# 74903, Qiagen, USA). RNA quantity, quality and integrity were initially measured with a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). Final quality control before submission for sequencing was completed with an Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 (used with an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit: Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All internode and root samples had RNA integrity number (RIN) values > 8.2 ( Supplementary Data File 3 Table S6). Leaf samples had significantly lower RIN values of > 6.4 ( Supplementary data file 3 Table S6). The lower RIN values observed in the leaf material were determined to be due to the presence of additional chloroplast rRNA peaks in the Bioanalyser profile, which resulted in altered RIN and rRNA 26S/18S ratios ( Babu and Gassmann, 2011 ) ( Supplementary Data File 3 Figure S13 ). In total, 6 root, 12 leaf and 54 internode samples were processed. Internode samples were collected in internodal regions of three samples, which were bulked after extraction. After bulking, a total of 18 RNA samples (9 internode, 6 leaf and 3 root samples) were examined per genotype. 2.4 RNA sequencing and library QC Approximately 2 µg RNA from each sugarcane tissue sample was submitted to the Queensland Brain Institute, (University of Queensland, St Lucia QLD, 4072). Samples were prepared with an Illumina TruSeq™ stranded total RNA library prep kit, with 1000 ng of the submitted RNA. Each sample was sequenced in three lanes on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument to obtain 125 bp paired-end reads. Read data were assessed with FastQC ( Andrews, 2010 ), to determine quality and adapter sequences. Read adapter trimming and quality trimming was accomplished in CLC genomics workbench v11.0.1 (CLC-GWB, QIAGEN Bioinformatics, Aarhus, Denmark) using universal adapter sequences provided by Illumina and a quality score limit of ≤0.01 (Phred score equivalent ≥ 20), allowing a maximum of two ambiguous nucleotides, and removing reads below 35 bp. Both paired-end reads and single reads were used in downstream analysis. 2.5 Reference sequences A full-length sugarcane transcriptome database developed by Hoang et al. 2017, was used as the reference sequence ( Hoang et al., 2017 ) in the assessment of transcript specific gene expression. The transcriptome was derived from a set of pooled RNA samples from various organs and genotypes including the same RNA samples sequenced with Illumina in this study. Overall, RNA samples from internode, root and leaf samples in 22 commercial and introgressed sugarcane genotypes were used. The transcriptome was synthesised with PacBio Isoform sequencing, defining specific isoforms of corresponding genes expressed in the RNA samples. 2.6 Transcript profiling and differential expression analysis The pipeline used to profile the transcriptome of the multiple samples in this experiment was based on the protocol ‘Expression Analysis using RNA-seq’ by QIAGEN bioinformatics ( QIAGEN, 2017 ) in the CLC-GWB. CLC-GWB produces transcript profiles and differential expression analysis without a reference genome guiding transcript allocation. The RNA-seq package (v. 2.15) used in CLC is based on QIAGEN’s proprietary EM estimation algorithm, which is inspired by the RSEM and eXpress methods. The abundance of transcripts was iteratively estimated whilst reads were assigned to transcripts according to the abundance ( QIAGEN, 2018 ). The abundance of each isoform was estimated by alignment of the Illumina RNA-seq data of each sample to the sugarcane reference transcriptome using the RNA-seq analysis function (Navigation: Toolbox > RNA-seq analysis > RNA-seq analysis; settings presented in Supplementary data file 3 Figure S14 ). CLC-GWB’s RNA-seq package builds reads tracks aligned to their respective transcripts, and a table of raw read counts and normalised expression values. Normalised expression values include Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM) and Transcripts Per Million reads (TPM). The read count profile for each sample was parsed manually using the table filtering system into the following groups; >0–0.3, 0.3–1, 1–5, 5–10, 10–100 and >100, on the basis of TPM expression values. The same filtering system was used to extract lists of highly expressed genes (TPM ≥ 500) from each sample for downstream annotation with Blast2Go. To identify differentially expressed transcripts, we used the differential expression (DE) for the RNA-seq data analysis function in CLC-GWB (Navigation: Toolbox > RNA-seq analysis > Differential Expression for RNA-seq data). The DE analysis in CLC-GWB uses multi-factorial statistics based on a negative binomial model (generalised linear model). It also considers the unbalanced sequencing depth of each sample, which facilitates the identification of differentially expressed genes despite highly variable ranges of data ( QIAGEN, 2018 ). Finally, it produces read tracks and a differential gene expression (DGE) table containing fold changes (log 2 and basic fold changes), between conditions as well as the statistical probabilities of transcript comparisons (p-value, Bonferroni and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value). 2.7 Functional annotation of differentially expressed transcripts General functional comparisons of differentially expressed (DE) transcripts were obtained with the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment analyses via PlantRegMap ( Jin et al., 2017 ) and KEGG Orthology-Based Annotation System (KOBAS) v3.0 ( Xie et al., 2011 ), respectively. Both analyses were performed with the SUGIT transcriptome as the background. Only enriched GO terms and pathways with an FDR-corrected p-value ≤ 0.05 were used to compare among the DE transcript sets. For functional classification of DE transcripts, fasta files of the DGE analyses were extracted from CLC-GWB, and each transcript was assigned a functional BIN with the online Mercator X4 v1.0 ( Schwacke et al., 2019 ) application. 2.8 Data analysis Venn diagrams were created with extracted transcript ID lists from CLC-GWB in the online Venn tools developed by the University of Ghent ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/ ) and the InteractiVenn web tool ( Heberle et al., 2015 ). The CLC-GWB analyses were conducted on the CLC Genomics Server, the CLC server, nodes and CLC-clients which are part of the Robert Henry Bioinformatics infrastructure at QAAFI, The University of Queensland, Australia. All CLC infrastructure was hosted by the Research Computing Centre, based at the University of Queensland, Australia ( UQ, 2019 ). All other analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel (as part of the Microsoft Office 365 software package) and R-Studio 1.2.1335 (an integrated toolset of R-3.6.0) ( Gandrud, 2016 ), with the ggplot2 package ( Wickham, 2016 ) and pheatmap ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/ ). 3 Results 3.1 RNA-seq summary To investigate the DE transcripts among organs collected from commercial sugarcane genotypes, we performed RNA-seq analysis. A total of six samples were used, including immature internode tissue (TI), mature internodes (MI and BI), mature leaves (L5 and L1) and roots (R). The total number of trimmed reads for each tissue ranged between 14 and 99 million, (details in Table 1 ). 3.2 Global expression analysis of sugarcane RNA-seq data 3.2.1 Quality control In the 18 samples analysed, the reference transcript isoforms with a TPM > 0 ranged from 31,346 to 79,927. Transcripts with TPM ranges of >0–0.3, 0.3–1, 1–5, 5–10, 10–100 and >100 are presented ( Fig. 1 a) . A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the TPM values of all samples to measure the relatedness of the tissue and the replicates of the same tissue ( Fig. 1 b) . The expression values of all 107,598 reference transcripts were used in the PCA, and principle components 1 and 2 dimensions were plotted. The result indicated high relatedness between all leaves as well as roots. Far more variability was observed in the internodes, particularly those of the BI samples, and the MI and TI samples clustered relatively closely. Two BI samples did not cluster close to the MI and TI cluster. This finding is likely to indicate the BI samples to have reached a level of dormancy/inactivity expected of very mature tissues, as growth and sucrose filling has been completed ( Lingle and Thomson, 2012 ). The BI replicates’ similar transcriptional profile to those of TI and MI samples suggested that this replicate has not yet reached the level of dormancy seen in the other BI replicates. 3.2.2 Venn transcript profile comparison Root tissue had the highest amount of uniquely expressed transcripts among all samples (2286), followed by L5 (1355), TI (756), BI (607), L1 (597) and MI (566) ( Fig. 1 c ). A total of 77,359 transcripts were shared among all organs, with 2286, 2701 and 3488 uniquely expressed transcripts for the root, internode and leaf tissue respectively ( Fig. 1 d) . The Venn comparison of internode samples of differing maturities revealed 66,293 transcripts represented at all internodal maturities, with 6035, 2654 and 2428 unique transcripts identified in TI, MI and BI internodes, respectively ( Fig. 1 e) . A total of 75,938 transcripts were shared between leaf types, whilst 3533 and 9841 unique transcripts were identified in L1 and L5 tissue, respectively ( Fig. 1 f) . 3.3 Differential gene expression analysis The number of transcripts with fold change ≥ 2 and an FDR p-value ≤ 0.01 were summarised for all possible tissue comparisons ( Fig. 2 a). In the comparison among the three internodal samples with differing maturity, little to no transcriptional difference was observed between mature internodes (BI and MI). Between the immature internodes (TI) and mature internodes, larger transcriptional differences were observed. Between leaves (L1 and L5), relatively small transcriptional differences were observed. Larger transcriptional differences were observed in comparisons between leaves and internodes. In this comparison group, the largest transcriptional differences were observed between the immature internodes and both leaves. Larger differences were also observed between the mature internodes and leaves. The larger disparity observed for the upregulated and downregulated transcripts between the leaves and the BI internodal sample might have been explained by the variability between the BI RNA-seq replicates (PCA in Fig. 1 a ) leading to fewer significantly upregulated transcripts. The root samples used in this study were from younger plants (3-months-old) than the other samples, which were all sampled at 9-months. Therefore, the root samples might have contained more immature cells than a 9-month-old plant samples. A high degree of transcriptional difference was observed between root and internodes of all maturities. Differences in transcription were highest between the roots and leaves, in contrast to all other comparisons between organs. Because of the transcriptional similarity of some samples (L1 and L5 and MI and BI) and for simplicity of analysis, we chose four DGE comparisons comparing the major organ types and the internodes of differing maturity for downstream analyses (details in Supplementary data file 2 Table S4). Among the four comparisons, the lowest count of unique transcripts was found in the comparison between immature and mature internodes. Comparisons among organ types yielded larger degrees of uniquely DE transcripts, particularly for the leaves and roots ( Fig. 2 b) . GO term categorisations indicated the largest transcriptional differences among organ types, within the biological process ( Fig. 3 a) , cellular component ( Fig. 3 b) and molecular function ( Fig. 3 c) groupings. Leaves displayed the clearest difference with respect to both R and TI samples and showed a large proportion of high gene ratio terms relating to photosynthetic activity. Smaller differences were observed in the comparison between R and TI samples, and terms with high gene ratios related to polysaccharide metabolism and photosynthesis. Smaller differences were observed for TI vs. MI, and the identity of most DE transcripts fell within cell-wall biosynthetic and polysaccharide metabolism-related GO terms. Similar differences were observed between each comparison in the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis ( Fig. 3 d) . The Mercator web application assigns functional BINs to both DNA and protein sequence inputs for subsequent pathway analysis within Mapman ( Schwacke et al., 2019 ). Separate BIN assignment counts were determined for upregulated and downregulated transcripts. The comparison between mature and immature internodes indicated the immature internodes had more of DE transcripts (with higher expression) in every BIN, except for BINs 7, 9, 15 and 26. The greatest difference in transcript assignment was observed in BINs 3, 18, 19, 20 and 21, in favour of immature internodes, which were related to carbohydrate metabolism, structural (cell-wall and cytoskeleton) and protein-related processes ( Fig. 4 a) . The BIN assignment comparison between L5 and R showed a 25-fold increase in the number of photosynthetic (BIN 1) transcripts with higher expression in the leaf tissue. In most other BINs a higher number of DE transcripts was observed in the root tissue, particularly BINs relating to RNA, protein and structural processes ( Fig. 4 b) . Most BINs had a larger amount of higher DE transcripts in the root, within the R vs. TI comparison ( Fig. 4 c) . The only BINs with a larger number of transcripts within the TI tissue were photosynthesis (BIN 1) and protein biosynthesis related (BIN 17) The BIN assignment comparison between leaf (L5) and immature internodes (TI) showed a 27-fold increase in the number of photosynthetic (BIN 1) transcripts with higher expression in the leaf tissue. In most other BINs, a higher number of DE transcripts was observed in the TI tissue, particularly BINs relating to RNA, protein and structural processes ( Fig. 4 d) . Pathway analysis was then performed to compare the log 2 FC values of the DE transcripts associated with the major pathways of C partitioning. The pathway analysis displayed aspects of hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and starch synthetic pathways, as well as pathways associated with C flux into lignin or hemicellulose synthesis, i.e., the pentose phosphate (PPP), myo- inositol, shikimate, phenylalanine synthetic and glycolytic pathways ( Fig. 5 ) . The comparison between mature and immature internodes indicated the immature internodes had a higher expression of some transcripts associated with UDP-glucose synthesis from sucrose, then UDP-glucose utilisation into hemicellulosic and cellulosic pools (comparison No. 1, Fig. 5 ) . Several transcripts associated with lignin biosynthesis also had higher expression in the immature internodes. However, some dirigent protein-associated transcripts did have higher expression in the mature internode. Pathway analysis of the leaf tissue and the immature internode comparison indicated mostly higher expression of transcripts relating to cell-wall deposition (UDP-glucose, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin synthesis, and the myo- inositol pathway), and fructose phosphorylation in the immature internode (comparison No. 2, Fig. 5 ) . A small number of cellulose synthase transcripts did have higher expression in leaves. Gluconeogenesis, starch synthesis/degradation (syn/deg), and the trehalose-6-phosphate pool-related transcripts exhibited higher expression in leaves. Transcripts associated with PPP, glycolysis, sugar transport, the shikimate pathway and sucrose phosphate synthase activity had large numbers of transcripts with higher expression in both the leaf and immature internode. The root vs. leaf comparison (comparison No. 3, Fig. 5 ) revealed similar trends of gene expression to those in the immature internode vs. leaf comparison. However, in most cases, the number of DE transcripts was higher at most points in the pathway, particularly in the myo- inositol pathway and starch syn/deg. The only major differences were observed for the fructokinase and hexokinase related transcripts which displayed mostly higher expression the root tissue. In the immature internode vs. root comparison, higher expression was observed in transcripts associated with UDP-glucose, lignin, phenylalanine, hemicellulose synthesis, sucrose hydrolysis (invertase), fructose and glucose phosphorylation, the myo- inositol pathway, trehalose-6-phosphate pool, and the PPP (comparison No. 4, Fig. 5 ) . The only point in the pathway where the immature internode had a larger number of transcripts with higher expression was in the starch syn/deg pathway. An equal number of transcripts associated with cellulose synthase activity had higher expression in both TI and R samples. 4 Discussion C is used differentially between the three major sugarcane ( Saccharum spp. hybrids) organ types, leading to a distinctly different makeup of insoluble and soluble C fractions ( de Souza et al., 2013; Hodgson-Kratky et al., 2019; Mason, 2020 ). 4.1 Internodes The expression of transcripts associated with C partitioning showed distinct differences favouring cell-wall, protein and secondary metabolite synthesis and respiration in immature internodes, as well as sucrose storage in mature internodes, as indicated in several previous studies ( Botha and Black, 2000; Hoang et al., 2017; Thirugnanasambandam et al., 2019; Bindon and Botha, 2002; Casu et al., 2007 ). This notion was mostly supported by our data ; as evidenced by the elevated levels of transcription, particularly in the cell-wall, carbohydrate metabolism and respiratory-related transcripts in the immature internode compared with those in mature source and sink samples. In the focused pathway analysis, most DE transcripts were associated with the direct synthesis of UDP-glucose from sucrose, or consumption into cellulose and hemicellulosic precursors, which were higher in immature internodes. Unsurprisingly, most transcripts were associated with UDP-glucose, the precursor of major cell-wall components, thus suggesting the control of the UDP-glucose pool is central to how C will be partitioned in internodes ( Hoang et al., 2017 ). Wai et al. (2017) have indicated the importance of UDP-glucose synthesis from sucrose in novel Saccharum hybrids, deducing a link between rapid UDP-glucose synthesis & sucrose conversion and high biomass accumulation ( Wai et al., 2017 ). This observation revealed the close relationship between hexose allocation and cell-wall biosynthesis. The lack of elevated expression in sucrose synthetic genes in mature internodes contradicts the enzymatic activity indicated in previous studies ( Botha and Black, 2000; Pan et al., 2009; Rae et al., 2005; Casu, 2003 ). This observation may suggest that competition for sucrose and UDP-glucose by invertase, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGD), cellulose synthase (CesA), and sucrose synthase (SuSy) (UDP-forming) enzymes may be key to the lower sucrose levels in immature internodal tissues, as previously implied ( Bindon and Botha, 2002 ), rather than enhanced competition for UDP-glucose and fructose-6-phosphate due to the activity of the sucrose synthesising enzyme sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) in mature internodes. Genes/transcripts associated with the UGD, CesA and SuSy enzymes have also been found to have significantly higher expression in immature internodes in a prior study ( Hoang et al., 2017 ). The lack of difference between the mature internode BI and MI samples, as indicated by the very few DE genes, suggested the expression levels remained stable following tissue maturity, and throughout sucrose filling. In this study, similar transcriptional profiles observed between internodes of different maturity, suggested that transcriptional changes in select sets of genes influence changes in the direction of C partitioning. This finding contrasts with the large transcriptional differences observed between the major organ types (leaves, internodes and root). An overview is provided in Fig. 6 . 4.2 Root On the basis of the compositional analysis of roots in Mason et al. ( Mason, 2020 ), the bulk of C in roots is probably used in respiration, and protein and cell-wall synthesis, via the cleavage/hydrolysis of imported sucrose ( Mason, 2020 ). Overall, the higher expression of transcripts associated with the aforementioned pools, in comparison to leaf and storage sinks, is consistent with this supposition. Sugarcane root and immature internodes use C in similar ways, in which the C imported from source organs is not stored as sucrose, as is the case in mature internodes (meristematic sinks) ( Wang, 2013 ). However, the previously uncharacterised root system was shown to have distinctly different transcriptional activity associated with C partitioning. Transcripts associated with C utilisation involving sucrose degradation into UDP-glucose, fructose, glucose, lignin and hemicellulose synthesis had higher expression in roots than in immature internodes. Interestingly, evidence of enhanced activity was observed within the alternate hemicellulose synthetic pathway, the myo- inositol pathway ( Endres and Tenhaken, 2011 ). Elevated concentrations of the hemicellulosic monomers galactose and arabinose have been reported in sugarcane roots ( Mason, 2020 ) and may be associated with the higher expression of some transcripts associated with hemicellulose synthesis in roots. Furthermore, in the same study, the lignin content was significantly higher in roots, in line with the heightened expression of transcripts related to lignin biosynthesis. An overview is provided in Fig. 6 . 4.3 Leaf Leaves the primary source organs of plants. Throughout their lifecycle they are a net exporter of C, via the fixation of atmospheric C as part of the photosynthetic reaction ( McCormick et al., 2006 ). Leaves contain very low levels of sugars, as a result of active exportation of C from this tissue, and high levels of unassigned mass, which has been stipulated to be primarily protein, as a result of the presence of the photosynthetic machinery ( Mason, 2020 ). Transcript expression leading to cell-wall related pools, i.e., lignin, hemicellulose, cellulose respiratory, and some protein synthetic pools was lower than that of meristematic sinks. Several transcripts associated with the glycolytic pathway that had higher expression in leaves suggested a smaller but still significant requirement for C for protein and respiratory pools, as reported by another study ( van der Merwe et al., 2010 ). As much as 80% of C fixed by source organs is transported out; however, most of the other 20% is likely to be used in the aforementioned pools. In source tissues, transcripts associated with sucrose synthesis from UDP-glucose and hexose phosphates displayed elevated expression, probably indicating the synthesis of sucrose from photosynthesis via the triose-phosphate pool ( Wang et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, the lower expression of enzymes associated with fructose 1,6 biphosphate (F1,6BP) synthesis in leaves ( Supplementary Data File 2 Figure S12 ), suggested a lower degree of inhibition of SPS enzyme function, which would further enhance the likelihood of elevated activity of sucrose synthesis in this tissue ( Groenewald and Botha, 2008 ). Interestingly, mature internodes did not display the same degree of low expression of transcripts associated with F1,6BP synthesis as leaves. This finding was unexpected, because the synthesis of F1,6BP is considered a potential key factor in controlling and minimising sucrose accumulation in immature internodes, via the regulation of hexose phosphates to triose phosphates ( van der Merwe et al., 2010 ). This is further supported by a previous kinetic analysis of sucrose and F1,6BP enzymes, which indicated that a specific SuSy enzyme has the most pronounced effect on sucrose synthesis and storage in mature internodes ( Uys et al., 2007 ). This result may suggest that the diminished expression of transcripts related to F1,6BP synthesis plays more of a key role in the promotion of sucrose synthesis in source tissues than in storage sinks. In contrast, the opposite is likely to be true for mature internodes. The lower expression of solute transporters than that in immature sink tissues, specifically sucrose transporters, was unexpected, particularly because leaf tissues actively transport>80% of fixed C as sucrose ( Kalt-Torres et al., 1987 ). Previous characterisations of sucrose transporters (specifically SUT), have been found to have higher expression in leaves and mature internodes ( Rae et al., 2005; Rae et al., 2005 ). An overview is provided in Fig. 6 . 4.6 Conclusion Overall, in the results from previous compositional analyses, transcription closely aligned with differences in the overall biomass makeup of insoluble and soluble components. Transcript expression in both active source samples (L1 and L5) displayed higher expression in photosynthetic transcripts and some protein and respiratory transcripts, and very low expression of most transcripts associated with cell-wall synthesis. Meristematic sinks, (R and TI) displayed significantly lower transcript expression relating to photosynthesis, and far higher expression of cell-wall related transcripts, particularly with respect to the source samples. Interestingly, transcription among the different meristematic sinks distinctly differed, a finding potentially associated with differences in composition. The comparison of the major organs of sugarcane in this study allows for enhanced assessment of the differences in transcriptional control of C partitioning throughout the sugarcane plant. The identification of contrasting transcription, relating to differences in C partitioning among the major organs of sugarcane, should provide a valuable resource for future research and manipulation of the variety of related pathways. Organ-specific transcription, such as the higher expression of cell-wall related transcripts in immature sinks, or the higher expression of sucrose synthetic transcripts in source organs, will enable closer analysis of the specific gene isoforms controlling these specific differences in C partitioning.
