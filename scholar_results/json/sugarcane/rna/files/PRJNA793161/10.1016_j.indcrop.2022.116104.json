    "full_text": "Ultrasonic treatment within a suitable range often has positive effects on seed germination and plant growth. In the present study, three sugarcane varieties, ROC22 (V1), LC05–136 (V2), and YT93–159 (V3), were treated with ultrasound waves with a mixed frequency of 20–40 kHz for 1, 2, and 5 min. Moreover, the changes in the transcriptome of the sugarcane variety ROC22 with and without ultrasonic treatment at 0, 6, and 12 days of germination were studied. The results showed that suitable ultrasonic treatment substantially increased the length, diameter, and germination rate of sugarcane buds and significantly improved the antioxidant enzyme activities of sugarcane to prevent oxidative burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from damaging cell membranes. A total of 2756 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) (1395 upregulated and 1361 downregulated) were identified in the day 0 comparison; a total of 831 DEGs (408 upregulated and 423 downregulated) were identified in the day 6 comparison, and 5987 DEGs (1862 upregulated and 4125 downregulated) were identified in the day 12 comparison. Furthermore, ultrasonic treatment significantly affected the hormone synthesis pathways, reduced the contents of auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and jasmonic acid (JA), and increased the ratio of IAA/ABA to promote germination. The gene expression of gibberellin (GA) synthesis was upregulated, whereas the gene expression of ABA synthesis was downregulated, resulting in improved germination of sugarcane buds. Overall, the optimal exposure time for ultrasonic treatment differed among the varieties; however, an appropriate ultrasonic treatment could regulate the antioxidant system and hormone synthesis pathways, thereby promoting the germination of sugarcane. This study provides a theoretical basis and technical support for ultrasonic treatment employed to promote sugarcane germination and growth."

          "All living things are capable of sensing and responding to physical stimuli ( Telewski, 2006 ). Many creatures routinely use sound waves to locate or communicate ( Gagliano et al., 2012a ). Similarly, important processes such as plant growth, reproduction, and evolution are all affected by the physical environment ( Gagliano et al., 2012b; Telewski, 2006 ). Studies have reported that plants can exchange information concerning root growth and development ( Baluska et al., 2010; Ciszak et al., 2012 ). Therefore, the use of ultrasound to regulate plant physiological and biochemical metabolism has received attention as a rapid and reagent-less physical method ( Gallo et al., 2018; Rokhina et al., 2009 ). Research has shown that low-intensity ultrasound promotes cell proliferation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Wang et al., 2003 ), whereas ultrasonic treatment can effectively improve Agrobacterium -mediated transformation efficiency in flax ( Beranova et al., 2008 ). Ultrasound was employed to regulate the differentiation of protocorm-like bodies during asexual reproduction of Dendrobium species ( Wei et al., 2012 ). Additionally, Ananthakrishnan et al. (2007) showed that ultrasound can be used as a physical stimulus to manipulate the growth of plant cells and organs.",
          "Moreover, ultrasonic seed treatment is a safe, inexpensive, convenient, and environmentally friendly physical technology that has had positive impacts on the germination and growth of dormant seeds as well as on plant development and metabolism ( Huang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2015 ). Nazari et al. (2014) reported that ultrasonic waves had significant potential to break seed dormancy; however, there was no linear correlation between the duration of ultrasonic treatment and the characteristics of seed growth and development. Liu et al. (2016) indicated that the germination of aged seeds and the growth of seedlings were promoted by ultrasonic treatment; this provided basic evidence for the treatment of aged grass seeds by ultrasound. Previous studies indicated that ultrasonic treatment affected the germination of the seeds of common beans by increasing the cotyledon cell area ( Lahijanian and Nazari, 2017 ), whereas changing the frequency and time of ultrasonic treatment is able to regulate the dynamics of water uptake during barley germination ( Abramov et al., 2019 ). Moreover, the germination rate of Dioscorea seeds was effectively improved under the action of ultrasonic waves, and the growth rate of seedlings was also increased ( Andriamparany and Buerkert, 2019 ). Recently, Wang et al. (2020a) demonstrated that ultrasonic treatment enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity as well as the contents of reducing sugars and flavonoids of Tartary buckwheat seeds, thereby promoting their germination and growth. Most of the previous studies have focused on the phenotypic and physiological effects of ultrasonic treatment in the seed germination process; nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of ultrasonic treatment-induced improvements in seed germination have not been explored.",
          "Sugarcane ( Saccharum spp. hybrids), a tropical and subtropical crop, is the raw material for industrial sugar production and for the extraction of ethanol as an energy substitute ( Cavalett et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2018 ). The sugarcane industry in China contributes to poverty alleviation, and more than 100 tropical countries rely on sugarcane to boost their economies ( Deng et al., 2021; Ou et al., 2013 ). It has been reported before that ultrasonic treatment promotes the germination and growth of different crop seeds; however, the effects of ultrasonic treatment on the germination and growth of sugarcane have rarely been studied. Therefore, the present study aims to determine the changes in germination, growth, and physiological properties of different varieties of sugarcane under different ultrasound levels. Moreover, the molecular mechanism by which ultrasonic treatment promotes sugarcane germination is clarified through transcriptome sequencing."

The sugarcane buds were ultrasonically processed using a Plant Seed Production Increase Processor (JD-1 L, Guangzhou Golden Rice Agricultural Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China). The processed sugarcane buds were placed into a plastic basin, and then, a standard germination experiment was carried out in a lighting incubator (PGX-280A-3 H, Ningbo Life Instruments, China), lasting 12 days. The culture conditions were set as follows: 28 °C temperature, 75% relative humidity, 12:12 (L:D) photoperiod, and 3000 lx light intensity.

Similarly, suitable ultrasonic treatment significantly affected the diameter and germination rate of sugarcane buds at 12 days. The results showed that compared with T0, both T2 and T3 increased the diameters of sugarcane buds of V1 and V2, while T3 promoted the growth of sugarcane buds of V3 ( Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, we found that the germination rate of sugarcane buds was significantly improved after ultrasonic treatment. Compared with T0, the germination rates of T2 and T3 increased significantly for V1, whereas the germination rates of T1, T2, and T3 increased significantly for V2 and V3 at 12 days ( Fig. 2 c).

Unlike V1 and V2, V3 required longer ultrasonic treatment time to increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Compared with T0, T3 significantly increased SOD, CAT, and POD activities on days 3, 6, 9, and 12 ( Table 1 ).

During the germination of sugarcane buds, the hormone determination results showed that the contents of all three hormones (IAA, ABA, and JA) were decreased with the progress of sugarcane germination, and there were significant differences compared with CK. Compared with CK, the IAA content under ultrasonic treatment for 2 min was significantly increased at 12 days ( Fig. 6 a), whereas ABA content was substantially reduced at 6 and 12 days ( Fig. 6 b). In contrast, the content of JA was significantly increased at 6 and 12 days ( Fig. 6 c). Furthermore, the IAA/ABA ratio under the ultrasonic treatment for 2 min was higher than that of CK at 6 and 12 days, but at 0 days, the IAA/ABA ratio was lower than that of CK ( Fig. 6 d). The above analysis indicated that ultrasound promoted the increase of IAA/ABA ratio and JA content during the process of sugarcane bud germination, thus promoting the germination of sugarcane. In order to verify this fact, we conducted an experiment on the effect of exogenous hormones on the germination of sugarcane buds. The results showed that exogenous hormones IAA, ABA, and JA affected the germination of sugarcane ( Fig. 7 ). Compared with B0 (Control), the germination of sugarcane was inhibited under low IAA/ABA ratio and promoted under high IAA/ABA ratio or appropriate concentration JA solutions. Under the mixed solution of high IAA/ABA ratio and appropriate concentration of JA (B4), the germination speed of sugarcane was basically the same as that in the ultrasonic treatment (B5) ( Fig. 7 )."

              "Ultrasonic treatment promoted cell division and accelerated seed germination, whereas its effectiveness was associated with the frequency and time of exposure to the ultrasonic waves ( Nazari et al., 2014 ). In this study, we found that ultrasonic treatment of 20–40 kHz mixed frequency for 2–5 min could promote the germination and growth of sugarcane buds. There is evidence that suitable ultrasonic treatment can increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes to maintain the normal ability of plants to scavenge free radicals and ROS, thereby promoting seedling growth ( Chen et al., 2013; da Silva and Dobranszki, 2014 ). Our results showed that the activities of antioxidant-related enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT) were significantly increased by the ultrasonic treatment, as this contributed to the reduction of superoxide anion content and enhanced the antioxidant properties of sugarcane buds and promoted germination of sugarcane buds. In plants, free radicals cause lipid peroxidation and result in MDA accumulation and the associated cytotoxic effects ( Hafez et al., 2020 ). Previous studies have shown that suitable ultrasonic treatment can scavenge free radicals from plant cells, protect cell membranes, and increase the rate of intracellular transport ( Huang et al., 2020 ). In this study, ultrasonic treatment for 2 min reduced the MDA content significantly in sugarcane buds, which indicates that appropriate ultrasonic treatment can effectively remove free radicals, thereby reducing the production of ROS and protecting cell membranes.",
              "Lipid metabolism is essential for plant seed germination, whereas the synthesis of JA and its derivatives is involved in lipid metabolism that can regulate various processes in plants ( Chini et al., 2018 ). For the JA signal transduction pathway in plants, JAR1 catalyzes the binding of JA and isoleucine (Ile) to form a JA-Ile complex that then specifically binds to the JA receptor COI1 and then the transcription repressor protein JAZ protein that acts to release the signal transmission transcription factor MYC2 and activate the transcription of JA early response genes ( Kazan and Manners, 2013; Major et al., 2017; Ruan et al., 2019 ). Previous studies showed that JA synthesis related genes were up-regulated during seed germination to promote JA synthesis, thereby reducing ROS, improving resistance, and promoting seed germination and growth ( Hu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020b ). In this study, the transcriptome results revealed that there were differences in the three comparative lipid synthesis-related pathways ( Fig. S4a –c) as well as in the key genes responsible for JA synthesis ( Figs. S5–S7 ). Specifically, COI1 and MYC2 gene expression levels were significantly up-regulated on the 12th day, and JAZ gene expression was also mainly up-regulated. This indicates that appropriate ultrasonic treatment may promote JA synthesis, reduce ROS, and thus promote the germination of sugarcane buds.",
              "Previous studies have shown that the synthesis and decomposition of ATP were accelerated after ultrasonic treatment; the cell membrane transport speed was increased, and the synthesis of various metabolites was promoted ( Hwang et al., 2016 ). In this study, transcriptome results showed that related genes of the ATP-binding cassette were also significantly upregulated at 12 days, which is conducive to the synthesis of metabolites. Therefore, in the present study, the sugarcane buds had increased contents of osmotic regulators (soluble proteins) after ultrasonic treatment, which is conducive to maintaining the stability of cell membrane."

              "Hormones play indispensable roles in plant germination, growth, development, maturation, and senescence. IAA and ABA affect the basic processes of plant cell elongation and division, thereby regulating plant germination and growth ( Kende and Zeevaart, 1997 ). Ultrasonic treatment is a special physical stimulation method with multiple complex biological effects ( Liu et al., 2003 ). Previous study has shown that ultrasonic treatment can effectively change the IAA and ABA contents of Chrysanthemum callus to regulate its differentiation and growth ( Wang et al., 2004 ). Wei et al. (2012) indicated that endogenous hormone changes may be caused by the influence of ultrasound during the differentiation of protocorm-like bodies. Similar findings were found in our study, suitable ultrasonic treatment clearly enhanced the germination and growth of sugarcane buds, and this may have been due to changes in hormonal content in sugarcane bud cells ( Fig. 6 a and b). In addition, this study found that during the process of sugarcane germination, the contents of IAA and ABA showed significant downward trends, indicating that high content of IAA and ABA help sugarcane buds to stay dormant, and low content of IAA and ABA are stimuli for sugarcane buds to germinate, which is basically consistent with the research findings of Carrera-Castano et al. (2020) and Kucera et al. (2005) . It was also observed that after ultrasonic treatment, the IAA/ABA ratio in the sugarcane buds increased significantly, and this change promoted the germination of sugarcane. The subsequent exogenous hormone model test results also verified that high IAA/ABA ratio can promote sugarcane germination. In other crops, da Silva and Dobranszki (2014) and Wang et al. (2004) have similar findings. In the transcriptome results and RT-qPCR verification, the expression of the three comparative IAA and ABA related genes also showed a downward trend, which is basically consistent with the change trend of the hormone content (IAA and ABA) during the germination of sugarcane buds ( Figs. S5–S7 ; Fig. 5 b). Therefore, we infer that during the germination of sugarcane buds, ultrasound regulates the expression of genes related to IAA and ABA, reduces IAA and ABA content, increases IAA/ABA ratio, and promotes sugarcane germination and growth.",
              "Gibberellin (GA) plays an important role in seed germination and growth. In the GA signal transduction pathway, the DELLA protein has the function of binding to other regulatory proteins in protein-protein interactions ( Daviere and Achard, 2013; Lilley et al., 2013 ). The DNA-binding ability of transcription factors ( TFs ) is inhibited by interacting with DELLA , thereby negatively regulating the transcription of GA ( Daviere and Achard, 2016; Yoshida et al., 2014 ). In this study, the TF gene expression was upregulated at 0 days, and DELLA gene expression was downregulated at 12 days ( Fig. S5 and Fig. S7 ), demonstrating that ultrasonic treatment could promote GA synthesis to promote the germination and growth of sugarcane buds. This is similar to the research results of Bentsink and Koornneef (2008) .",
              "Our transcriptome results also indicated that a small number of differentially expressed genes were enriched in the cytokinin (CTK) and salicylic acid (SA) synthesis pathways, but there were very few differentially expressed genes in this regard, and these are not discussed in this article ( Figs. S5–S7 )."

RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression of the four genes mentioned above was affected by ultrasonic treatment. However, due to too few relevant genes, the mechanism of light signal transduction during sugarcane germination mediated by ultrasonic treatment needs to be further explored."

In addition, ultrasonic treatment affected the regulation of many DEGs involved in sugarcane hormone synthesis, hormone ratio, signal transduction, and anti-oxidation. Ultrasonic treatment could promote the germination of sugarcane buds owing to improvement in antioxidant capacity and prevention of the damage from ROS and through regulation of IAA, ABA, and JA and other hormone signaling pathways involved in the sugarcane bud germination processes. The mechanism of regulation of ROS and hormone pathway by DEGs explains how suitable ultrasonic treatment can promote sugarcane germination and growth, and thus, the results provide a theoretical basis for ultrasonic application in sugarcane production."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction All living things are capable of sensing and responding to physical stimuli ( Telewski, 2006 ). Many creatures routinely use sound waves to locate or communicate ( Gagliano et al., 2012a ). Similarly, important processes such as plant growth, reproduction, and evolution are all affected by the physical environment ( Gagliano et al., 2012b; Telewski, 2006 ). Studies have reported that plants can exchange information concerning root growth and development ( Baluska et al., 2010; Ciszak et al., 2012 ). Therefore, the use of ultrasound to regulate plant physiological and biochemical metabolism has received attention as a rapid and reagent-less physical method ( Gallo et al., 2018; Rokhina et al., 2009 ). Research has shown that low-intensity ultrasound promotes cell proliferation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Wang et al., 2003 ), whereas ultrasonic treatment can effectively improve Agrobacterium -mediated transformation efficiency in flax ( Beranova et al., 2008 ). Ultrasound was employed to regulate the differentiation of protocorm-like bodies during asexual reproduction of Dendrobium species ( Wei et al., 2012 ). Additionally, Ananthakrishnan et al. (2007) showed that ultrasound can be used as a physical stimulus to manipulate the growth of plant cells and organs. Moreover, ultrasonic seed treatment is a safe, inexpensive, convenient, and environmentally friendly physical technology that has had positive impacts on the germination and growth of dormant seeds as well as on plant development and metabolism ( Huang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2015 ). Nazari et al. (2014) reported that ultrasonic waves had significant potential to break seed dormancy; however, there was no linear correlation between the duration of ultrasonic treatment and the characteristics of seed growth and development. Liu et al. (2016) indicated that the germination of aged seeds and the growth of seedlings were promoted by ultrasonic treatment; this provided basic evidence for the treatment of aged grass seeds by ultrasound. Previous studies indicated that ultrasonic treatment affected the germination of the seeds of common beans by increasing the cotyledon cell area ( Lahijanian and Nazari, 2017 ), whereas changing the frequency and time of ultrasonic treatment is able to regulate the dynamics of water uptake during barley germination ( Abramov et al., 2019 ). Moreover, the germination rate of Dioscorea seeds was effectively improved under the action of ultrasonic waves, and the growth rate of seedlings was also increased ( Andriamparany and Buerkert, 2019 ). Recently, Wang et al. (2020a) demonstrated that ultrasonic treatment enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity as well as the contents of reducing sugars and flavonoids of Tartary buckwheat seeds, thereby promoting their germination and growth. Most of the previous studies have focused on the phenotypic and physiological effects of ultrasonic treatment in the seed germination process; nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of ultrasonic treatment-induced improvements in seed germination have not been explored. Sugarcane ( Saccharum spp. hybrids), a tropical and subtropical crop, is the raw material for industrial sugar production and for the extraction of ethanol as an energy substitute ( Cavalett et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2018 ). The sugarcane industry in China contributes to poverty alleviation, and more than 100 tropical countries rely on sugarcane to boost their economies ( Deng et al., 2021; Ou et al., 2013 ). It has been reported before that ultrasonic treatment promotes the germination and growth of different crop seeds; however, the effects of ultrasonic treatment on the germination and growth of sugarcane have rarely been studied. Therefore, the present study aims to determine the changes in germination, growth, and physiological properties of different varieties of sugarcane under different ultrasound levels. Moreover, the molecular mechanism by which ultrasonic treatment promotes sugarcane germination is clarified through transcriptome sequencing. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Experimental site and materials The sugarcane germination test was conducted at the Sugarcane Laboratory of South China Agricultural University (SCAU), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China on January 30, 2021. Three sugarcane varieties (V), i.e., ROC22 (V1), LC05–136 (V2), and YT93–159 (V3), were obtained from the sugarcane test base of SCAU. To ensure the reliability of the test results, full, fresh, and uniform sugarcane buds (single buds) were selected as experimental materials before ultrasonic treatment, and the sugarcane buds were soaked and sterilized with carbendazim. 2.2 Experimental treatments The ultrasonic (20–40 kHz mixed frequency) treatments were designed at four levels, namely no ultrasonic treatment (T0), ultrasonic treatment for 1 min (T1), ultrasonic treatment for 2 min (T2), and ultrasonic treatment for 5 min (T3), each processing 100 single sugarcane buds. The sugarcane buds were ultrasonically processed using a Plant Seed Production Increase Processor (JD-1 L, Guangzhou Golden Rice Agricultural Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China). The processed sugarcane buds were placed into a plastic basin, and then, a standard germination experiment was carried out in a lighting incubator (PGX-280A-3 H, Ningbo Life Instruments, China), lasting 12 days. The culture conditions were set as follows: 28 °C temperature, 75% relative humidity, 12:12 (L:D) photoperiod, and 3000 lx light intensity. In addition, an appropriate amount of water as per requirement was added to the plastic basin every day. 2.3 Plant sampling For each treatment, 10 buds were randomly selected on days 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 of the sugarcane germination, and the buds were placed in the light incubator was recorded as 0 days. The buds from the sugarcane were cut with an alcohol-sterilized knife, placed in a plastic bag, and stored at 80 °C until biochemical analysis ( Deng et al., 2020 ). 2.4 Biochemical assays Sugarcane buds were ground into powder with a pestle and mortar in an ice bath. Fresh samples (0.2 g) were added to 6 mL of 0.05 mol·L −1 sodium phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.8), centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used to determine antioxidant enzyme activities, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) and soluble protein content using methods described previously ( Ashraf et al., 2020; Ashraf and Tang, 2017; Li et al., 2021 ). The determination of superoxide anion (O 2- ) content was performed according to Mohammadi and Karr (2001) . In addition, the length (base to top) of 10 sugarcane buds was randomly measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 days after germination. On the 12th day, the number of sugarcane buds in each treatment was counted to calculate the germination rate, and the diameter (middle) of the sugarcane buds in each treatment was measured at the same time. 2.5 Transcriptome sequencing and data processing The transcriptome analysis comprised three groups, an untreated control (CK) and ultrasonic treatment of sugarcane variety ROC22 for 2 min at 0, 6, and 12 days, denoted as ROC22_CK_0, ROC22_2 min_0, ROC22_CK_6, ROC22_2 min_6, ROC22_CK_12, and ROC22_2 min_12. There were three biological replicates for each treatment, for a total of 18 samples, and each sample weighed about 0.5 g. Total RNA from sugarcane samples was extracted using a mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (R4154，Magen, Guangzhou, China). The integrity of the RNA was then assessed by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The constructed library was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 sequencer to generate 125 bp or 150 bp of paired-end data. The transcriptome sequencing and analysis were conducted by OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The relevant steps included Unigene functional annotation, Unigene quantification, differential Unigene screening, functional enrichment, and cluster analysis. 2.6 Validation of RNA-Seq data by real-time quantitative PCR Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to validate the RNA-Seq results for 14 gene transcripts ( Table S1 ). Purified RNA was reverse transcribed to synthesize cDNA, according to the instructions of a HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR (+gDNA wiper) Nanjing Novartis Reverse Transcription Kit, and then diluted 10 times for later use. For the primer design, please refer Wang et al. (2020c) . The GAPDH gene was used as the internal reference gene ( Table S1 ). The primers were synthesized by Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. According to the reaction system from the Nanjing Novartis ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix manual, real-time fluorescence quantification (CFX96, Bio-Rad) was used for the amplification reaction. The amplification cycling program was as follows: 180 s at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and finally 65–95 °C to prepare the melt curve. Three replicates were set for each sample, and the relative expression level of 14 genes was determined using the instrument's analysis software. 2.7 Measurement of hormone content The auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and jasmonic acid (JA) contents in fresh bud tissues of CK and after ultrasonic treatment for 2 min for sugarcane variety ROC22 at 0, 6, and 12 days were measured. The hormone extraction process was as follows: the sample (0.5 g) was put into a 10-mL centrifuge tube, and 5 mL of an isopropanol: water: formic acid (80:19:1, V/V/V) mixture was added, and the mixture was oscillated for 30 s with an ultrasonic cleaner (YJ25–12DT, Zhejiang, China) at room temperature and then sonicated for 15 min to assist extraction. In addition, dichloromethane (1 mL) was added to the centrifuge tube; the sample was again sonicated for 15 min under the same conditions and then centrifuged at 9000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a 10 mL centrifuge tube. Subsequently, the supernatant was concentrated by centrifugation with a vacuum centrifugal concentrator (6 K ES, VIRTIS, USA) under normal temperature conditions and reconstituted with 300 μL of methanol. Finally, the reconstituted solution was passed through a 0.22 µm nylon needle filter to obtain the hormone test solution. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the contents of IAA, ABA, and JA in sugarcane buds, and the kits used were purchased from Shanghai Enzyme-Linked Biotechnology Co., Ltd. 2.8 Sugarcane germination in the environment of exogenous hormones To further understand the effects of f hormones on sugarcane germination, six treatments were designed: B0 (no hormone, as a control), B1 (low IAA/ABA ratio, i.e. 5 mg IAA and 15 mg ABA/L), B2 (high IAA/ABA ratio, i.e. 15 mg IAA and 5 mg ABA/L), B3 (appropriate concentration JA, i.e. 2 mg/L), B4 (high IAA/ABA ratio and appropriate JA concentration, i.e. 15 mg IAA, 5 mg ABA, and 2 mg JA/L), and B5 (ultrasonic treatment for 2 min, no hormone). IAA, ABA, and JA were dissolved in distilled water to produce hormone solutions. Three repetitions each treatment. Sugarcane buds (single buds) of ROC22 were germinated in plastic pots to which 500 mL of different hormone solutions were added (500 mL of distilled water for B0 and B5). The germination conditions of sugarcane were as described above. Moreover, the bud lengths were measured at 12 days. 2.9 Statistical analysis Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed by using SPSS software (version 21.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA), whereas differences between specific treatments were analyzed using least significant difference (LSD) tests at the 0.05 probability level. Moreover, paired-sample t-tests were performed using SPSS software (95% confidence intervals), and Pearson's correlation was used to examine the association between T0 and T2 of V1. 3 Results 3.1 Effects of ultrasonic treatment on germination and growth of sugarcane buds The sugarcane began to germinate on the second day after being put into the lighting incubator, and the growth of different varieties of sugarcane under the various treatment times was significantly different ( Fig. 1 ). Compared with T0, suitable ultrasonic treatment significantly increased the sugarcane shoot length of the three cultivars during germination; specifically, the bud lengths of T2 and T3 increased significantly in V1, while the bud lengths of V2 and V3 increased significantly at T2 and T3, respectively ( Fig. 2 a). Similarly, suitable ultrasonic treatment significantly affected the diameter and germination rate of sugarcane buds at 12 days. The results showed that compared with T0, both T2 and T3 increased the diameters of sugarcane buds of V1 and V2, while T3 promoted the growth of sugarcane buds of V3 ( Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, we found that the germination rate of sugarcane buds was significantly improved after ultrasonic treatment. Compared with T0, the germination rates of T2 and T3 increased significantly for V1, whereas the germination rates of T1, T2, and T3 increased significantly for V2 and V3 at 12 days ( Fig. 2 c). In general, ultrasonic treatment can promote the germination and growth of sugarcane buds, although the appropriate treatment duration required by different varieties may be different. For these three varieties, ultrasonic treatment at this mix frequency (20–40 kHz) for 2–5 min is appropriate. 3.2 Effect of ultrasonic treatment on antioxidant system For V1, compared with T0, T2 significantly increased SOD and POD activities during sugarcane germination, but T2 significantly increased CAT activity only at 6 and 12 days ( Table 1 ). For V2, compared with T0, T2 tended to significantly increase SOD, CAT, and POD activities in the later stages (6, 9, and 12 days) of sugarcane germination ( Table 1 ). Unlike V1 and V2, V3 required longer ultrasonic treatment time to increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Compared with T0, T3 significantly increased SOD, CAT, and POD activities on days 3, 6, 9, and 12 ( Table 1 ). In general, these results suggest that the protective enzyme system of sugarcane buds after ultrasonic treatment can operate effectively to avoid the massive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protect the cell membrane, and thus promote the germination of sugarcane buds. 3.3 Oxidative damage and soluble protein content Compared with T0, the T2 and T3 significantly decreased the O 2- content of V1 at 6, 9, and 12 days, whereas T2 led to a significant decrease in O 2- content at 6 and 9 days, and T3 at 3, 6, 9, and 12 days for V2. T3 significantly decreased the O 2- content of V3 at 6, 9, and 12 days ( Table 2 ). Furthermore, the T2 and T3 substantially decreased the MDA content during the later stages (9 and 12 days) of budding of the three sugarcane varieties ( Table 2 ). In addition, the soluble protein content of sugarcane buds was significantly increased after appropriate ultrasonic treatment. In general, appropriate ultrasonic treatment can significantly reduce the content of O 2- and MDA and increase the content of soluble protein during the germination of sugarcane buds. 3.4 RNA-Seq data analysis and DEGs analysis In this analysis, the transcriptome sequencing of six processes (18 samples) was completed, and a total of 121.57 G of clean data were obtained. The effective data volume of each sample was distributed between 6.49 G and 7.09 G; the Q30 base distribution was between 93.43% and 93.97%, and the average GC content was 52.75%. There were 81918 Unigene strips that were spliced together, with a total length of 92140986 bp and an average length of 1124.8 bp. Table S2 shows an overview of the sequencing and alignment results of the transcriptome analysis. We used diamond software to compare Unigenes to NR, KOG, GO, Swissprot, eggNOG, and KEGG databases, and we used HMMER software with the Pfam database to perform Unigene functional analysis. The numbers of Unigenes annotated by KEGG, KOG, GO, Pfam, Swissprot, eggNOG, and NR databases were 9383, 24058, 28427, 28583, 31451, 45343, and 50874, respectively ( Fig. S1 ). The principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the first two principal components explained 90.08% of the variance of the transcriptome data across the six treatments ( Fig. S2a ). Except for one sample in ROC22_2 min_6, the other samples had greater biological reproducibility, confirming the credibility of the results obtained from the transcriptome analysis. Moreover, the correlation test between samples agreed with the above results ( Fig. S2b ). In addition, a total of 2756 DEGs (1395 upregulated and 1361 downregulated) were identified in the day 0 comparison; a total of 831 DEGs (408 upregulated and 423 downregulated) were observed in the day 6 comparison, and 5987 DEGs (1862 upregulated and 4125 downregulated) were identified in the day 12 comparison ( Fig. 3 a). Further analysis revealed significant differences in transcriptomes among the three comparisons, as Venn diagrams indicated that only nine DEGs were common to the three comparison groups ( Fig. 3 b). The overall DEGs distributions on days 0, 6, and 12 are shown in Fig. 3 c–e. Cluster analysis of the changes in DEGs expression between the three comparisons is shown in Fig. S3a –b. To gain an in-depth understanding of the functions of the DEGs identified on days 0, 6, and 12, after obtaining the DEGs, GO (biological process, cellular composition, and molecular function) functional enrichment analysis was performed ( Ashburner et al., 2000 ). This experiment focused on ROS that were significantly enriched in biological processes, including “defense response” and “regulation of defense response” ( Fig. S4a –c). Moreover, pathway analysis was performed on the three contrasting differentially expressed protein-coding genes, and the significance of their differential gene enrichment was determined. Thus, the top 20 bubble charts from the KEGG enrichment analysis were obtained ( Fig. 4 a–c). The results showed that the pathways “plant hormone signal transduction” and “MAPK signal” were significantly enriched in comparison groups. For the functional annotation based on DEGs, we screened 40 candidate genes related to sugarcane germination and growth from the KEGG pathways, including IAA, ABA, gibberellin (GA), JA, and other hormone synthesis related genes as well as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and antioxidant enzyme synthesis related genes ( Fig. 4 d–f). 3.5 Real-time quantitative PCR validation To verify the transcriptome results and the gene expression related to hormone synthesis, 11 genes (eight of which were related to hormone synthesis in sugarcane bud germination) were selected from the KEGG pathways for RT-qPCR analysis ( Table S1 ). Furthermore, three genes ( CRY1, HY5 and RVE ) ( Table S1 ) related to light signaling pathways were validated. Correlation analysis and linear fitting of the gene expression quantity (FPKM) obtained by transcriptome sequencing and the relative quantitative results of RT-qPCR of the corresponding genes were performed. The RT-qPCR results for 14 genes were significantly correlated with the RNA-Seq results (r = 0.836, p < 0.001), indicating that the transcriptome sequencing results were reliable ( Fig. 5 a and b). In addition, the results showed that the relative expression levels of genes related to hormone synthesis in sugarcane buds would be altered after ultrasonic treatment, and the trend was basically the same as that of RNA-Seq ( Fig. 5 b). Moreover, the expression of four differentially expressed genes involved in light signaling, CRY1 , HY5 , PIF , and RVE , were validated by RT-qPCR, and the results showed that ultrasonic treatment affected the expression of the above genes. Therefore, it can be inferred that ultrasound treatment may affect the light signal transduction during the germination of sugarcane buds ( Fig. 5 b). 3.6 Effects and verification of ultrasound on hormone content and hormone ratio in sugarcane bud germination The transcriptome analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in the plant hormone signaling pathways of KEGG, especially the biosynthesis of IAA, ABA, and JA. During the germination of sugarcane buds, the hormone determination results showed that the contents of all three hormones (IAA, ABA, and JA) were decreased with the progress of sugarcane germination, and there were significant differences compared with CK. Compared with CK, the IAA content under ultrasonic treatment for 2 min was significantly increased at 12 days ( Fig. 6 a), whereas ABA content was substantially reduced at 6 and 12 days ( Fig. 6 b). In contrast, the content of JA was significantly increased at 6 and 12 days ( Fig. 6 c). Furthermore, the IAA/ABA ratio under the ultrasonic treatment for 2 min was higher than that of CK at 6 and 12 days, but at 0 days, the IAA/ABA ratio was lower than that of CK ( Fig. 6 d). The above analysis indicated that ultrasound promoted the increase of IAA/ABA ratio and JA content during the process of sugarcane bud germination, thus promoting the germination of sugarcane. In order to verify this fact, we conducted an experiment on the effect of exogenous hormones on the germination of sugarcane buds. The results showed that exogenous hormones IAA, ABA, and JA affected the germination of sugarcane ( Fig. 7 ). Compared with B0 (Control), the germination of sugarcane was inhibited under low IAA/ABA ratio and promoted under high IAA/ABA ratio or appropriate concentration JA solutions. Under the mixed solution of high IAA/ABA ratio and appropriate concentration of JA (B4), the germination speed of sugarcane was basically the same as that in the ultrasonic treatment (B5) ( Fig. 7 ). 4 Discussion 4.1 Effects of ultrasonic treatment on ROS and osmotic regulators Ultrasonic treatment promoted cell division and accelerated seed germination, whereas its effectiveness was associated with the frequency and time of exposure to the ultrasonic waves ( Nazari et al., 2014 ). In this study, we found that ultrasonic treatment of 20–40 kHz mixed frequency for 2–5 min could promote the germination and growth of sugarcane buds. There is evidence that suitable ultrasonic treatment can increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes to maintain the normal ability of plants to scavenge free radicals and ROS, thereby promoting seedling growth ( Chen et al., 2013; da Silva and Dobranszki, 2014 ). Our results showed that the activities of antioxidant-related enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT) were significantly increased by the ultrasonic treatment, as this contributed to the reduction of superoxide anion content and enhanced the antioxidant properties of sugarcane buds and promoted germination of sugarcane buds. In plants, free radicals cause lipid peroxidation and result in MDA accumulation and the associated cytotoxic effects ( Hafez et al., 2020 ). Previous studies have shown that suitable ultrasonic treatment can scavenge free radicals from plant cells, protect cell membranes, and increase the rate of intracellular transport ( Huang et al., 2020 ). In this study, ultrasonic treatment for 2 min reduced the MDA content significantly in sugarcane buds, which indicates that appropriate ultrasonic treatment can effectively remove free radicals, thereby reducing the production of ROS and protecting cell membranes. Lipid metabolism is essential for plant seed germination, whereas the synthesis of JA and its derivatives is involved in lipid metabolism that can regulate various processes in plants ( Chini et al., 2018 ). For the JA signal transduction pathway in plants, JAR1 catalyzes the binding of JA and isoleucine (Ile) to form a JA-Ile complex that then specifically binds to the JA receptor COI1 and then the transcription repressor protein JAZ protein that acts to release the signal transmission transcription factor MYC2 and activate the transcription of JA early response genes ( Kazan and Manners, 2013; Major et al., 2017; Ruan et al., 2019 ). Previous studies showed that JA synthesis related genes were up-regulated during seed germination to promote JA synthesis, thereby reducing ROS, improving resistance, and promoting seed germination and growth ( Hu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020b ). In this study, the transcriptome results revealed that there were differences in the three comparative lipid synthesis-related pathways ( Fig. S4a –c) as well as in the key genes responsible for JA synthesis ( Figs. S5–S7 ). Specifically, COI1 and MYC2 gene expression levels were significantly up-regulated on the 12th day, and JAZ gene expression was also mainly up-regulated. This indicates that appropriate ultrasonic treatment may promote JA synthesis, reduce ROS, and thus promote the germination of sugarcane buds. Previous studies have shown that the synthesis and decomposition of ATP were accelerated after ultrasonic treatment; the cell membrane transport speed was increased, and the synthesis of various metabolites was promoted ( Hwang et al., 2016 ). In this study, transcriptome results showed that related genes of the ATP-binding cassette were also significantly upregulated at 12 days, which is conducive to the synthesis of metabolites. Therefore, in the present study, the sugarcane buds had increased contents of osmotic regulators (soluble proteins) after ultrasonic treatment, which is conducive to maintaining the stability of cell membrane. 4.2 Effects of ultrasonic treatment on the regulation of IAA, ABA and GA Hormones play indispensable roles in plant germination, growth, development, maturation, and senescence. IAA and ABA affect the basic processes of plant cell elongation and division, thereby regulating plant germination and growth ( Kende and Zeevaart, 1997 ). Ultrasonic treatment is a special physical stimulation method with multiple complex biological effects ( Liu et al., 2003 ). Previous study has shown that ultrasonic treatment can effectively change the IAA and ABA contents of Chrysanthemum callus to regulate its differentiation and growth ( Wang et al., 2004 ). Wei et al. (2012) indicated that endogenous hormone changes may be caused by the influence of ultrasound during the differentiation of protocorm-like bodies. Similar findings were found in our study, suitable ultrasonic treatment clearly enhanced the germination and growth of sugarcane buds, and this may have been due to changes in hormonal content in sugarcane bud cells ( Fig. 6 a and b). In addition, this study found that during the process of sugarcane germination, the contents of IAA and ABA showed significant downward trends, indicating that high content of IAA and ABA help sugarcane buds to stay dormant, and low content of IAA and ABA are stimuli for sugarcane buds to germinate, which is basically consistent with the research findings of Carrera-Castano et al. (2020) and Kucera et al. (2005) . It was also observed that after ultrasonic treatment, the IAA/ABA ratio in the sugarcane buds increased significantly, and this change promoted the germination of sugarcane. The subsequent exogenous hormone model test results also verified that high IAA/ABA ratio can promote sugarcane germination. In other crops, da Silva and Dobranszki (2014) and Wang et al. (2004) have similar findings. In the transcriptome results and RT-qPCR verification, the expression of the three comparative IAA and ABA related genes also showed a downward trend, which is basically consistent with the change trend of the hormone content (IAA and ABA) during the germination of sugarcane buds ( Figs. S5–S7 ; Fig. 5 b). Therefore, we infer that during the germination of sugarcane buds, ultrasound regulates the expression of genes related to IAA and ABA, reduces IAA and ABA content, increases IAA/ABA ratio, and promotes sugarcane germination and growth. Gibberellin (GA) plays an important role in seed germination and growth. In the GA signal transduction pathway, the DELLA protein has the function of binding to other regulatory proteins in protein-protein interactions ( Daviere and Achard, 2013; Lilley et al., 2013 ). The DNA-binding ability of transcription factors ( TFs ) is inhibited by interacting with DELLA , thereby negatively regulating the transcription of GA ( Daviere and Achard, 2016; Yoshida et al., 2014 ). In this study, the TF gene expression was upregulated at 0 days, and DELLA gene expression was downregulated at 12 days ( Fig. S5 and Fig. S7 ), demonstrating that ultrasonic treatment could promote GA synthesis to promote the germination and growth of sugarcane buds. This is similar to the research results of Bentsink and Koornneef (2008) . Our transcriptome results also indicated that a small number of differentially expressed genes were enriched in the cytokinin (CTK) and salicylic acid (SA) synthesis pathways, but there were very few differentially expressed genes in this regard, and these are not discussed in this article ( Figs. S5–S7 ). 4.3 Ultrasonic treatment-mediated germination involves other mechanisms The phenomenon of light-regulated seed growth and development is not only a physiological process but also a process of light signal transduction and light-regulated gene expression ( Heschel et al., 2008; Kircher et al., 2002 ). In this study, the KEGG enrichment pathway results (top 20) showed that no enrichment pathway related to the direction of light signal regulation were found ( Fig. 4 a–c), although we obtained four differentially expressed genes related to light signals through screening, namely CRY1 , HY5 , PIF , and RVE . RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression of the four genes mentioned above was affected by ultrasonic treatment. However, due to too few relevant genes, the mechanism of light signal transduction during sugarcane germination mediated by ultrasonic treatment needs to be further explored. 5 Conclusions Overall, the current study revealed that suitable ultrasonic treatment (20–40 kHz mixed frequency, 2–5 min) promotes the germination and growth of sugarcane buds. In addition, ultrasonic treatment affected the regulation of many DEGs involved in sugarcane hormone synthesis, hormone ratio, signal transduction, and anti-oxidation. Ultrasonic treatment could promote the germination of sugarcane buds owing to improvement in antioxidant capacity and prevention of the damage from ROS and through regulation of IAA, ABA, and JA and other hormone signaling pathways involved in the sugarcane bud germination processes. The mechanism of regulation of ROS and hormone pathway by DEGs explains how suitable ultrasonic treatment can promote sugarcane germination and growth, and thus, the results provide a theoretical basis for ultrasonic application in sugarcane production.
