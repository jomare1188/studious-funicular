    "full_text": "Drought stress is a common hazard faced by sugarcane growth, and utilizing microorganisms to enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stress has become an important method for sustainable agricultural development. Several studies have demonstrated that Streptomyces chartreuses WZS021 improves sugarcane tolerance to drought stress. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance at the transcriptional and metabolomic levels remain unclear. We comprehensively evaluated the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which WZS021 enhances drought tolerance in sugarcane, by performing transcriptome sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics; and examining rhizosphere soil properties and plant tissue antioxidant capacity. WZS021 inoculation improved the rhizosphere nutritional environment (AP, ammonia, OM) of sugarcane and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of plant roots, stems, and leaves (POD, SOD, CAT). Comprehensive analyses of the transcriptome and metabolome revealed that WZS021 mainly affects plant drought tolerance through phenylalanine metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. The drought tolerance signaling molecules mediated by WZS021 include petunidin, salicylic acid, α-Linoleic acid, auxin, geranylgeraniol and phenylalanine, as well as key genes related to plant hormone signaling transduction ( YUCCA , amiE , AUX , CYPs , PAL , etc.). Interestingly, inoculation with WZS021 during regular watering induces a transcriptome-level response to biological stress in sugarcane plants. This study further elucidates a WZS021-dependent rhizosphere-mediated regulatory mechanism for improving sugarcane drought tolerance, providing a theoretical basis for increasing sugarcane production capacity."

          "Sugarcane is an important sugar crop and bioenergy crop. More than 80% of sugarcane fields in China are distributed on slopes, mainly relying on rainfall ( Guga et al., 2021 ). Drought stress is the most important environmental factor restricting sugarcane growth ( Guga et al., 2023 ; Qin et al., 2023 ). Insufficient water can lead to stunted sugarcane plants, reducing biomass accumulation and resulting in significant yield losses ( Ghannoum, 2016 ). Drought can lead to a loss of up to 60% in sugarcane yield ( Misra et al., 2022 ). Water scarcity in arid soils results in elevated soil temperatures and diminished nutrient availability, adversely impacting crop growth, development, and yield, ultimately contributing to land degradation ( d'Oria et al., 2022 ). Drought stress triggers adverse effects in plants, including oxidative stress induced by ions and osmotic stress, leading to the formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells ( Samanta et al., 2023 ). Plant responses to drought are intricate and encompass leaf wilting, reduced net photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, altered water-use efficiency, reduced relative water and total chlorophyll contents, and hormonal responses to counter stress and enhance tolerance ( Gupta et al., 2020 ).",
          "In addition to protecting plants internal immune systems from biotic and abiotic stresses, microorganisms in the rhizosphere can establish beneficial symbioses with plants that reduce the damage caused by drought stress ( Toju et al., 2018 ). The use of microorganisms to improve plant drought tolerance is a sustainable method in keeping with green agriculture. In recent years, beneficial plant endophytes have received extensive attention because they can interact with host plants, promote plant growth, enhance drought and disease tolerance, and remediate heavy metal pollution ( Jayakumar et al., 2020 ; Pang et al., 2022 ). Microorganisms can promote nutrient absorption and healthy plant growth by supporting growth-promoting functions including nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, and auxin secretion, and improve plant adaptability to adverse external conditions to improve their stress tolerance ( Xu et al., 2020 ; Scudeletti et al., 2021 ; Pang et al., 2024 ). Increased stress tolerance in plants is an outcome of their coevolution with microorganisms under harsh environmental conditions ( Rodriguez and Redman, 2008 ). Previous studies have shown that inoculation with drought-tolerant microorganisms improves host plant drought resistance ( Wang et al., 2019 ; Chandrasekaran, 2022 ). Screening for drought-tolerant microorganisms is thus of great significance for improving plant drought resistance.",
          "Various omics technologies have been applied to studies of complex mechanisms in plant biology ( Vita et al., 2020 ; Jeyasri et al., 2021 ). Complex plant biological processes are difficult to elaborate using single-omics technologies. Multiomics joint analyses build gene regulatory networks by integrating different levels of omics information, and provide a deeper understanding of the regulation and causal relationships between molecules to further understand gene functions and interaction networks in plants under different environmental conditions ( Shah et al., 2018 ; Qin et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021a ). In joint analyses of the transcriptome and metabolome, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the transcriptome and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in the metabolome can be combined to analyze internal changes in organisms at two different levels, cause (genes) and result (metabolites), to reveal internal laws governing organisms behaviors ( Cai et al., 2022 ).",
          "In a previous study, a Streptomyces strain, WZS021, was isolated from a sugarcane rhizosphere and characterized for its various growth-promoting properties, including ACC deaminase activity, nitrogen fixation and high production of IAA and siderophores ( Wang et al., 2017 , 2021b ). WZS021 could extensively colonize sugarcane roots, enhances sugarcane drought resistance by promoting root growth and secreting ACC deaminase and IAA, thereby inducing systemic tolerance ( Wang et al., 2019 ). Inoculation with WZS021 changed the community composition of the sugarcane rhizosphere microbiome, recruiting more beneficial microorganisms into the rhizosphere, thereby improving nitrogen and phosphorus absorption under stress conditions ( Wang et al., 2023 ). This study first evaluated the changes in tissue physiology and rhizosphere environment of sugarcane after inoculation with WZS021. Secondly, transcriptomics and metabolomics were used to analyze the differences and correlations in gene expression and metabolite synthesis between inoculated and uninoculated treatments, in order to better understand the mechanism by which WZS021 enhances drought resistance in sugarcane. This study provides valuable molecular information on the response of sugarcane drought resistance to inoculation with WZS021, revealing the relevant biological pathways through which WZS021 plays an important role in sugarcane drought resistance. This will provide evidence and guidance for the application of Streptomyces as a microbial agent for drought resistance."

              "Sugarcane variety ‘ ROC22 ’ from Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences was used in this study. The genome and plant growth promoting (PGP) traits of S . chartreuses WZS021 isolated from sugarcane rhizosphere have been published previously ( Wang et al., 2017 , 2019 , 2021b ). A pot cultivation experiment was conducted in a sugarcane greenhouse at Yulin Normal University (Yulin, China). The indoor temperature ranged from 24 to 32 °C. The soil was red loam, and its characteristics are listed in Table S1 . Plastic pots were used for cultivation (50 cm high, with an inner diameter of 45 cm), with one sugarcane plant per pot, each holding 25 kg of soil. Four treatment groups were established, consisting of regular watering without inoculation (CK) (T1), drought stress without inoculation (T2), regular watering with inoculation (T3), and drought stress with inoculation (T4). Each treatment was performed with 5 replicates (i.e. 5 pots/group). One month after planting sugarcane, bacterial suspension (200 mL) was applied, uninoculated plants were treated with an equal volume of sterile water, followed by monthly applications thereafter. After the fifth application, T2 and T4 underwent drought stress (soil water content: 35 ± 5%) for 7 days, after which all treatments were sampled ( Table S2 ). According to Bulgarelli et al. (2012) , 2 g of rhizosphere soil samples were collected near the roots of each treated plant, and 1 g each of root, stem and leaf were collected from corresponding plants and stored at −80 °C. Five biological replicates of rhizosphere soil and plant tissue samples were used to evaluate the physiological and biochemical conditions of root growth. Three biologically duplicated root tissue samples were used for transcriptome and metabolome analyses."

DHA was significantly higher in stressed plants than in T1 soil (40%), but AKP remained significantly lower than in non-stressed plants (34%). Under water stress, no significant differences in OM and AP levels were observed in rhizosphere soil after inoculation, whereas AK decreased significantly (16.8%), and ammonia increased significantly (4.4 fold; Fig. 1 B–D). In response to drought antioxidant enzyme levels in sugarcane roots, stems, and leaves significantly increased, but decreased to varying degrees after inoculation with WZS021 ( Fig. 1 E–I). Osmotic regulatory substances in plant tissues exhibited similar trends. MDA and PRO contents in root and leaf tissues did not significantly differ under drought stress after inoculation. These results indicate that WZS021 enhances drought stress tolerance by improving the rhizosphere soil environment and physiological conditions in plant tissues."

Gene expression was quantified, and differentially expressed genes were identified based on their expression. The DEGs were further processed for functional annotation and enrichment analyses. A summary of the transcriptome sequencing data is provided in Table S4 .",
              "To investigate the effect of WZS021 on gene expression in sugarcane roots under drought stress, RNA-seq analysis was performed on sugarcane root samples subjected to the four different treatments. The overall distribution of gene expression levels in all samples was similar, with density peaks above 0.4 ( Fig. 2 A). PCA of transcript expression revealed that root samples from each treatment were grouped together, suggesting minimal differences between the three replicates of each treatment ( Fig. 2 B). The first two components accounted for 80.8% of the variation and distinguished the four differently treated samples without overlap, highlighting the significant impact of drought and inoculation on the gene expression profile of plant roots. According to DESeq2 analysis, compared to regular watering, 2887 DEGs were detected under drought stress conditions, of which 848 genes were upregulated and 2039 genes were downregulated ( Fig. 2 C). Under the inoculation conditions, 12,367 DEGs were produced, of which 3335 genes were up-regulated and 9032 genes were down regulated ( Fig. 2 D), indicating that the transcriptional changes in sugarcane roots after inoculation were much greater than those caused by drought stress. Under drought stress after inoculation, 3685 DEGs were differentially expressed in sugarcane roots, with 2039 DEGs up-regulated and 1646 DEGs down-regulated ( Fig. 2 E). Under inoculated conditions, drought stress caused the differential expression of 10,704 DEGs, with 7989 DEGs upregulated, and 2715 DEGs downregulated ( Fig. 2 F), suggesting that WZS021 helps sugarcane mobilize DEG expression in plant roots in response to drought stress.",
              "KEGG enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, phenolpropanoid biosynthesis, MAPK signaling, starch and sucrose metabolism, plant pathway interactions, and other pathways ( Fig. 3 A–D). It is worth noting that under drought conditions, the top three pathways for number of upregulated genes after inoculation are phenolpropanoid biosynthesis (94, 14.6%), search and cross metabolism (48, 7.4%), and plant hormone signal transduction (40, 6.2%), indicating that phenolpropanoid biosynthesis is one of the important pathways by which WZS021 helps plants improve drought resistance ( Fig. 3 C). In terms of GO classification, DEGs in both inoculated and arid sugarcane roots were most enriched in biological processes, with the top three being the oxidative stress response, hydrogen peroxide catabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism, with more than 60 DEGs participating ( Fig. S1 ). Thus, WZS021 may directly participate in plant drought tolerance by upregulating the expression of these genes.",
              "To validate the RNA-seq results, qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of nine upregulated sugarcane genes. The results of qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated no significant differences from our RNA-seq data, and similar trends were observed for both upregulated and downregulated genes ( Fig. S2 ). These results confirmed the reliability of the RNA-seq data."

A total of 9682 peaks were detected, with 917 annotated metabolites. Drought stress resulted in 647 DAMs in the root system, of which 363 were up-regulated and 284 were downregulated. Three metabolites with log 2 FC values > 23 were detected (upregulated: tetrahydrofurfuryl cinnamate, 2−phenylbutyrolactone, petunidin; downregulated: asparaginyl-asparagine) ( Fig. 4 A). A total of 639 DAMs were detected under inoculated conditions, of which 330 were upregulated and 309 were downregulated. Petunidin showed the largest difference (log 2 FC = 25.09) ( Fig. 4 B). When sugarcane was subjected to drought stress, inoculation resulted in the production of 529 DAMs in the root system, among which 274 were upregulated and 255 were downregulated. The top three downregulated metabolites were tetrahydrofurfuryl cinnamate, 2-Phenylbutyrolactone, and petunidin. Interestingly, these three metabolites were also the top three up-regulated metabolites in response to drought stress in the absence of WZS021 ( Fig. 4 C). After pre-inoculation, drought stress resulted in the identification of 546 DAMs, of which 296 metabolites were upregulated and 250 were downregulated. The largest fold downregulation was observed for petunidin ( Fig. 4 D). Joint KEGG enrichment analysis of the co-mapped pathways revealed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was significantly enriched in response to both drought and inoculation ( Fig. 5 ). In addition, under drought conditions, significant changes in the physiological conditions of sugarcane roots, stems, leaves, and rhizosphere soil ( Fig. 6 A), many DEGs were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction ( Fig. 6 B) and linoleic acid metabolism pathways in response to WZS021 inoculation."

Among these, shikimate, phenylalanine, hydroxybenzoate, phenylacetate, and l-phenylalanine increased significantly, whereas transcinnamic acid, phenylacetylglutamine, and phenylethanol decreased significantly. After inoculation, the genes expressing phenylalanine ammonia-lyase ( PAL ), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase ( PAT ), shikimate kinase ( SK ), 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase ( DHS ), 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase ( hppD ), and amidase ( amiE ) were upregulated, while those expressing primary-amine oxidase ( PAO ), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ), and arogenate dehydratase ( ADT ) were downregulated, with significant changes observed ( Fig. 6 C).

          "Sugarcane is an important sugar and energy crop and drought is an abiotic stress factor that restricts its growth. Root systems play crucial roles in water and nutrient absorption by plants. Changes in the physicochemical properties of rhizosphere soil and changes in physiological, biochemical, transcriptomic, and metabolomic properties of root tissue are key indicators of enhanced drought tolerance in sugarcane. Under abiotic stress, nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are crucial for stimulating plant growth and development ( Mostofa et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2024 ). Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are essential nutrients for plant growth, and plant contents of these elements can reflect soil quality and nutrient limitations ( Bai et al., 2019 ). The formation and transport of sugars within plants are intimately linked to potassium levels, which enhance nitrogen metabolism and bolster plant stress resistance ( Saudy and El-Metwally, 2019 ). In the present study, AKP, DHA, and urease activities were significantly depressed in sugarcane rhizosphere soil under drought stress than under other tested conditions. Following inoculation with WZS021, AKP, DHA, and urease activities were significantly enhanced in rhizosphere soil. However, both drought stress and inoculation significantly reduced OM content, while significantly improving pH conditions. Under drought stress, AP and AK contents in rhizosphere soil significantly increased, whereas ammonia content was significantly elevated in inoculated rhizosphere soil, which may reflect the nitrogen fixation ability of WZS021.",
          "Under drought stress, osmoregulatory substances become key factors that influence plant stress resistance. These substances modulate plant osmotic capacity, reduce osmotic potential, decrease water potential, preserve cell turgor, and alleviate damage induced by drought stress ( Ozturk et al., 2021 ). Under water-deficient conditions, Bacillus sp. WM13-24 and Pseudomonas sp. M30-35 enhanced CAT and POD activities in Haloxylon ammodendron , and increased PRO and MDA contents ( He et al., 2021 ). We assessed alterations in antioxidant enzymes and osmoprotectants in plant tissues after inoculation with S. chartreuses WZS021 under drought stress. SOD, POD, CAT, MDA, and PRO levels in sugarcane roots, stems, and leaves were significantly affected by the combined effects of drought and inoculation. Regardless of whether WZS021 or water deficiency alone is being assessed, antioxidant enzyme activities and osmoregulatory substance levels increased, indicating that either single treatment induces a stress response in sugarcane. When sugarcane received both treatments simultaneously, a significant decrease in stress response effects was observed compared to the effect of either single treatment, indicating that inoculation can help plants adapt better to drought stress. Azotobacter croccum can enhance antioxidant enzyme activity and accumulate osmotic protectants in peppermint under drought conditions, effectively maintaining the balance of cell osmotic potential, preventing plant dehydration, and defending against drought stress ( Asghari et al., 2020 ). Inoculating barley with Providencia rettgeri improves drought stress tolerance indicators, including PRO, MDA, and hydrogen peroxide contents ( Ferioun et al., 2023 ). Under drought conditions, plants produce large amounts of ROS, which increase membrane lipid peroxidation ( Qi et al., 2018 ). In this study, SOD, POD, and CAT activities in sugarcane roots inoculated with WZS021 increased to varying degrees under drought stress. S. chartreuses WZS021 activated the protective enzyme system in sugarcane leaves and roots, thereby enhancing enzyme activity, inducing physiological resistance to drought stress, and balancing the production and scavenging of ROS within the plant. Inoculation with Bacillus safensis PM22 significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activity of maize plants and reduced their MDA content to alleviate the oxidative damage caused by abiotic stress, thereby enhancing plant stress resistance ( Azeem et al., 2022 ). The MDA content in sugarcane significantly increased under drought stress, indicating that drought damage to sugarcane cell membrane systems increased the MDA content of lipid peroxidation products in cell membranes. MDA content in roots, stems, and leaves of sugarcane inoculated with WZS021 was significantly lower than that in control, plant tissues, indicating that WZS021 significantly reduced the MDA content in sugarcane, reduced ROS accumulation, and alleviated damage caused by drought stress. This further demonstrates that WZS021 can directly enhance its ability to resist drought stress by regulating plant physiological and biochemical reactions.",
          "This study described a mechanism by which Streptomyces drives plant stress defense at the transcriptional level. Determining the regulatory network of Streptomyces in the sugarcane response to drought stress is important for improving sugarcane drought tolerance and enhancing land development and utilization. Differential and enrichment analyses were performed on the transcriptome data to reveal significant physiological changes that occur in sugarcane at the transcriptional level in response to drought stress, reflecting the mechanism by which Streptomyces helps sugarcane respond to drought stress. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is a critical pathway for plant resistance to drought stress. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) catalyzes the non-oxidative deamination of l-phenylalanine or tyrosine, producing trans-cinnamic acid, and ultimately generating coumaroyl-CoA, which enters the downstream metabolism of flavonoids, lignins, and coumarins ( Yadav et al., 2020 ). Transcriptome analysis indicated that under drought stress, the SoPAL s family genes were significantly upregulated compared to treatment with WZS021 alone, resulting in a significant increase in salicylic acid content in root metabolites ( Fig. 6 ). Plants synthesize salicylic acid usually via the isochorismate synthase pathway or PAL pathway, the main contribution pathway of salicylic acid synthesis vary among different plants ( Ullah et al., 2023 ; Yang et al., 2023 ). Based on the results of this study, it is hypothesized that PALs may regulate the synthesis of downstream metabolites in sugarcane to resist abiotic stress. In recent years, the rapid advancement of omics technologies has allowed numerous studies to clarify the extensive involvement of plant phenylpropane metabolism and its downstream products under various stress conditions at transcript, protein, and metabolite levels ( de Vries et al., 2021 ; Dong and Lin, 2021 ; Ramaroson et al., 2022 ). Drought induces ROS production, which leads to fortification of the cell wall, superoxide reactions, and other effects, resulting in significant gene upregulation within the plant-pathogen interaction pathway. The starch and sucrose metabolism pathways not only participate in plant growth and development, but also play an important role in tolerance to abiotic stresses ( Chen et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2023 ). In previous studies, WZS021 promoted the production of plant hormones including IAA and ethylene in sugarcane leaves ( Wang et al., 2019 ), which was confirmed by upregulation of plant hormone signal transduction-related gene expression levels in this study.",
          "This study employed KEGG gene enrichment analysis to identify the most upregulated 94 genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. The following pathways were identified: plant-pathogen interactions, starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction, involving 63, 48, and 40 genes, respectively. This suggests that Streptomyces systematically enhances sugarcane response to drought stress by upregulating genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interactions, plant hormone signal transduction, and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. This demonstrates the significant positive regulatory role of Streptomyces in the expression of osmotic adjustment, antioxidant systems, plant hormone regulation, and regulatory protein-coding genes during the sugarcane response to drought stress. These physiological, biochemical, and molecular processes have been confirmed to be crucial in numerous studies on plant drought stress responses ( Fox et al., 2018 ; Kumar et al., 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ). Genes involved in the regulation of tyrosine N-monooxygenase, peroxidase (PRX), and KDEL-tailed cysteine endopeptidases showed significantly elevated expression levels. KDEL-tailed cysteine endopeptidases are also involved in root development ( Rodríguez-García et al., 2024 ). Tyrosine N-monooxygenase and peroxidase are closely associated with plant responses to drought stress ( Lian et al., 2023 ; Wang et al., 2024 ). The xyloglucosyl transferase gene, a key player in the dynamics and mechanics of plant cell walls, is downregulated ( Hrmova et al., 2022 ), and the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase genes play a critical role in regulating abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis in higher plants ( Jia et al., 2022 ). Actin depolymerizing factor is primarily associated with plant resistance to biotic stress ( Sun et al., 2023 ; Xu et al., 2023 ). This may be because sugarcane is not only affected by drought stress but also stimulated by Streptomyces as a biotic stress.",
          "Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that eliminate ROS produced in response to environmental stress. Flavonoids can enhance plant-microbial symbiosis to defend against stress and are an important way to improve plant stress resistance ( Wu et al., 2023 ). Drought can alter flavonoid content in the cell nucleus, and flavonoids work synergistically with plant hormones to help plants adapt to water deficiency ( Cai et al., 2023 ). In general, ROS production and scavenging within plants maintains a dynamic equilibrium. However, when plants face abiotic stresses such as drought and salt damage, this equilibrium is disrupted, causing rapid ROS accumulation and oxidative plant damage ( Ravi et al., 2023 ). Flavonoid metabolites exhibit strong antioxidant activities and protect plants from ROS. Drought stress can induce flavonoid accumulation and improve plant antioxidant capacity ( Li et al., 2021 ; Gao et al., 2023 ). Drought stress can induce accumulation of antioxidant metabolites including polyphenols and flavonoids in plant leaves and roots, thereby eliminating ROS ( Gharibi et al., 2019 ; Albergaria et al., 2020 ). These results demonstrate that phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, within the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway are crucial for enhancing plant drought resistance. Similarly, this study revealed that the antioxidant capacity of sugarcane leaves, stems, and roots significantly increased under drought stress in the presence of WZS021, potentially because suppression of ROS production by flavonoids and other phenolic compounds through WZS021 regulates the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway.",
          "It has long been recognized that amino acid accumulation is a hallmark plant response to abiotic stress, playing a critical role in stress resistance ( Ingrisano et al., 2023 ). Under osmotic stress, amino acids including proline and serine accumulate significantly in plant leaves ( Khan et al., 2020 ; Ozturk et al., 2021 ). Proline is a key osmotic regulator in plants responding to drought stress, with its levels indicating the extent of osmotic regulation against stress ( Lü et al., 2019 ). We found a significant increase in proline content in sugarcane roots from T2 to T4, indicating intensification of drought stress. Proline is synthesized in large quantities to regulate osmotic pressure, eliminate free radicals, and to act as a hydrophilic substance to reduce protein and enzyme degradation, thereby alleviating the damage caused by drought stress in sugarcane cells. Following drought stress, sugarcane undergoes a significant downregulation of amino acid metabolites ( Fig. 4 A), to reduce transpiration and slow growth to cope with drought stress in a way that conserves and reallocates resources. When WZS021 was applied under stress conditions, amino acid metabolites were predominantly upregulated ( Fig. 4 C). This modulation helps to regulate osmotic pressure, enhance water absorption, and maintain ionic homeostasis within the plant, thereby reducing drought-induced damage. Through the analysis of differential metabolites and related pathways, we identified alanine, aspartic acid, histidine, L-isoleucine, and saccharopine as key metabolites contributing to sugarcane drought resistance. Saccharopine is closely associated with glutamate, lysine, and proline synthesis, which aid plants in countering damage from abiotic stress ( Arruda and Barreto, 2020 ). Amino acid metabolic pathways are crucial for WZS021's role in enhancing sugarcane drought stress resistance by collaborating with other metabolic pathways to combat drought stress and ensure normal physiological functions. This study illustrates the role of WZS021 in modulating metabolic products and pathways during sugarcane's response to drought stress by analyzing the differential metabolites and pathways that actively respond to stress. The resulting data provide a reference for practical application of microorganisms in sugarcane water management, preventing long-term drought from reducing sugarcane quality and yield, and further unveiling the mechanisms by which WZS021 enhances sugarcane drought resistance.",
          "In conclusion, this study found that under the tested inoculation and drought stress conditions, the antioxidant capacity of different sugarcane tissues significantly increased. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses showed that the biosynthesis and metabolism of phenylalanine, flavonoids, and related gene transcription levels in sugarcane roots significantly increased after WZS021 inoculation under drought stress. Isolated inoculations can also simulate stress responses, including root growth, accelerated nitrogen metabolism, and phytohormone accumulation. WZS021 optimizes plant physiology and the rhizosphere nutritional environment, influencing key metabolic pathways including phenylalanine, flavonoids, and plant hormone signal transduction, thereby enhancing the drought resistance of sugarcane. Altogether with previous research, we can provide a scientific basis for the development of WZS021 as a microbial agent for enhancing plant drought resistance."

More than 80% of sugarcane fields in China are distributed on slopes, mainly relying on rainfall ( Guga et al., 2021 ). Drought stress is the most important environmental factor restricting sugarcane growth ( Guga et al., 2023 ; Qin et al., 2023 ). Insufficient water can lead to stunted sugarcane plants, reducing biomass accumulation and resulting in significant yield losses ( Ghannoum, 2016 ). Drought can lead to a loss of up to 60% in sugarcane yield ( Misra et al., 2022 ). Water scarcity in arid soils results in elevated soil temperatures and diminished nutrient availability, adversely impacting crop growth, development, and yield, ultimately contributing to land degradation ( d'Oria et al., 2022 ). Drought stress triggers adverse effects in plants, including oxidative stress induced by ions and osmotic stress, leading to the formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells ( Samanta et al., 2023 ). Plant responses to drought are intricate and encompass leaf wilting, reduced net photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, altered water-use efficiency, reduced relative water and total chlorophyll contents, and hormonal responses to counter stress and enhance tolerance ( Gupta et al., 2020 ). In addition to protecting plants internal immune systems from biotic and abiotic stresses, microorganisms in the rhizosphere can establish beneficial symbioses with plants that reduce the damage caused by drought stress ( Toju et al., 2018 ). The use of microorganisms to improve plant drought tolerance is a sustainable method in keeping with green agriculture. In recent years, beneficial plant endophytes have received extensive attention because they can interact with host plants, promote plant growth, enhance drought and disease tolerance, and remediate heavy metal pollution ( Jayakumar et al., 2020 ; Pang et al., 2022 ). Microorganisms can promote nutrient absorption and healthy plant growth by supporting growth-promoting functions including nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, and auxin secretion, and improve plant adaptability to adverse external conditions to improve their stress tolerance ( Xu et al., 2020 ; Scudeletti et al., 2021 ; Pang et al., 2024 ). Increased stress tolerance in plants is an outcome of their coevolution with microorganisms under harsh environmental conditions ( Rodriguez and Redman, 2008 ). Previous studies have shown that inoculation with drought-tolerant microorganisms improves host plant drought resistance ( Wang et al., 2019 ; Chandrasekaran, 2022 ). Screening for drought-tolerant microorganisms is thus of great significance for improving plant drought resistance. Various omics technologies have been applied to studies of complex mechanisms in plant biology ( Vita et al., 2020 ; Jeyasri et al., 2021 ). Complex plant biological processes are difficult to elaborate using single-omics technologies. Multiomics joint analyses build gene regulatory networks by integrating different levels of omics information, and provide a deeper understanding of the regulation and causal relationships between molecules to further understand gene functions and interaction networks in plants under different environmental conditions ( Shah et al., 2018 ; Qin et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021a ). In joint analyses of the transcriptome and metabolome, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the transcriptome and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in the metabolome can be combined to analyze internal changes in organisms at two different levels, cause (genes) and result (metabolites), to reveal internal laws governing organisms behaviors ( Cai et al., 2022 ). In a previous study, a Streptomyces strain, WZS021, was isolated from a sugarcane rhizosphere and characterized for its various growth-promoting properties, including ACC deaminase activity, nitrogen fixation and high production of IAA and siderophores ( Wang et al., 2017 , 2021b ). WZS021 could extensively colonize sugarcane roots, enhances sugarcane drought resistance by promoting root growth and secreting ACC deaminase and IAA, thereby inducing systemic tolerance ( Wang et al., 2019 ). Inoculation with WZS021 changed the community composition of the sugarcane rhizosphere microbiome, recruiting more beneficial microorganisms into the rhizosphere, thereby improving nitrogen and phosphorus absorption under stress conditions ( Wang et al., 2023 ). This study first evaluated the changes in tissue physiology and rhizosphere environment of sugarcane after inoculation with WZS021. Secondly, transcriptomics and metabolomics were used to analyze the differences and correlations in gene expression and metabolite synthesis between inoculated and uninoculated treatments, in order to better understand the mechanism by which WZS021 enhances drought resistance in sugarcane. This study provides valuable molecular information on the response of sugarcane drought resistance to inoculation with WZS021, revealing the relevant biological pathways through which WZS021 plays an important role in sugarcane drought resistance. This will provide evidence and guidance for the application of Streptomyces as a microbial agent for drought resistance. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Experimental materials and stress treatment Sugarcane variety ‘ ROC22 ’ from Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences was used in this study. The genome and plant growth promoting (PGP) traits of S . chartreuses WZS021 isolated from sugarcane rhizosphere have been published previously ( Wang et al., 2017 , 2019 , 2021b ). A pot cultivation experiment was conducted in a sugarcane greenhouse at Yulin Normal University (Yulin, China). The indoor temperature ranged from 24 to 32 °C. The soil was red loam, and its characteristics are listed in Table S1 . Plastic pots were used for cultivation (50 cm high, with an inner diameter of 45 cm), with one sugarcane plant per pot, each holding 25 kg of soil. Four treatment groups were established, consisting of regular watering without inoculation (CK) (T1), drought stress without inoculation (T2), regular watering with inoculation (T3), and drought stress with inoculation (T4). Each treatment was performed with 5 replicates (i.e. 5 pots/group). One month after planting sugarcane, bacterial suspension (200 mL) was applied, uninoculated plants were treated with an equal volume of sterile water, followed by monthly applications thereafter. After the fifth application, T2 and T4 underwent drought stress (soil water content: 35 ± 5%) for 7 days, after which all treatments were sampled ( Table S2 ). According to Bulgarelli et al. (2012) , 2 g of rhizosphere soil samples were collected near the roots of each treated plant, and 1 g each of root, stem and leaf were collected from corresponding plants and stored at −80 °C. Five biological replicates of rhizosphere soil and plant tissue samples were used to evaluate the physiological and biochemical conditions of root growth. Three biologically duplicated root tissue samples were used for transcriptome and metabolome analyses. 2.2 Collection of phenotypic, physiological, and biochemical parameter data After air-drying the collected soil samples, 0.1 g samples were taken to determine soil enzyme activity. Alkaline phosphatase (AKP, cat. No. BC0285), urease (cat. No. BC0120) and dehydrogenase (DHA, cat. No. BC0395) were measured using appropriate kits (Solarbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Soil properties, including pH, available P (AP), available potassium (AK), ammonium nitrogen (ammonia), and organic matter (OM), were determined using a soil nutrient analyzer (TPY-6A, Top Cloud-Agri Technology Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China). Sugarcane tissue was cleaned with ddH 2 O and the surface was wiped dry before being ground. Peroxidase (POD, cat. No. BC0090), catalase (cat. No. BC0205), and superoxide dismutase (SOD; cat. No. BC5165) activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA, cat. No. BC0025), and proline (cat. No. BC0290) levels were assayed using kits (Solarbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). 2.3 Transcriptome sequencing and qRT-PCR validation Total RNA was extracted from roots using an E. Z.N.A.® Plant RNA Kit. After removing the DNA, RNA quality and concentration were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and microspectrophotometry. Transcriptome sequencing was performed by Biomarker Technologies Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) for RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Platform. After acquiring the transcriptome sequencing data, the raw sequence data (raw reads) were filtered to obtain high-quality data (clean reads). The RNA-Seq-specific alignment software STAR was used to perform sequence alignment between the clean reads and the reference genome. Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) were used as indicators of gene expression levels. DESeq2 v1.22.1 was used to analyze DEGs between groups. The Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to correct P -values and control the false discovery rate (FDR). Genes with P -values<0.05 and Fold Change (FC) > 1.5 (up-regulated) or <0.67 (down-regulated) were considered DEGs. All raw sequencing data were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (accession number: PRJNA885747). To verify the accuracy of the transcriptome results, 9 genes were randomly selected from among the DEGs for qRT-PCR. A FastPure® Universal Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme Biotech, China) was used to extract total RNA from plant roots. A MightyScript Plus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Master Mix reverse transcription kit (Sangon Biotech, China) was used to reverse transcribe the RNA into cDNA. Primer 5.0 software was used to design specific primers ( Table S3 ), and qRT-PCR experiments were conducted using a 2 × Taq Pro Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix kit (Vazyme Biotech, China). Specific operations were carried out according to kit instructions. The qRT-PCR and amplification programs are listed in supplementary material. Using sugarcane GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as an internal reference gene, gene expression levels were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCT method ( Schmittgen and Livak, 2008 ). 2.4 Metabolite extraction, identification and analyses The LC/MS system for metabolomics analysis comprised a Waters Acquity I-Class PLUS ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a Waters Xevo G2-XS QTof high-resolution mass spectrometer. Detailed sample processing and testing conditions are described in supplementary material. MassLynx V4.2 was used to operate the LC/MS system and collect raw data, which were then processed using Proggenesis QI software for peak extraction, comparison, and identification. Following normalization of the original peak area using total peak area, principal component analysis (PCA) and Spearman correlation analysis were conducted to assess the repeatability of samples within a group. Searches for classification and pathway information of identified compounds were conducted using KEGG, HMDB, and lipidmaps databases. Based on grouping information, differential multiples were calculated and compared, and the P -value for each compound was determined using a t -test. The screening criteria P -value ≤0.05 and variable importance in projection (VIP) ≥ 1 were used to define DAMs. 2.5 Statistical analysis Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using IBM SPSS (Version 26., IBM Inc., Chicago), based on Duncan's multiple range test, with significance set at P < 0.05, to determine significant differences among treatment groups. 3 Results 3.1 WZS021 improves rhizosphere environment and physiological conditions Compared to uninoculated plants under drought stress, WZS021 inoculation significantly increased AKP, DHA, and urease activities in rhizosphere soil (43%, 116%, and 40%, respectively) ( Fig. 1 A). DHA was significantly higher in stressed plants than in T1 soil (40%), but AKP remained significantly lower than in non-stressed plants (34%). Under water stress, no significant differences in OM and AP levels were observed in rhizosphere soil after inoculation, whereas AK decreased significantly (16.8%), and ammonia increased significantly (4.4 fold; Fig. 1 B–D). In response to drought antioxidant enzyme levels in sugarcane roots, stems, and leaves significantly increased, but decreased to varying degrees after inoculation with WZS021 ( Fig. 1 E–I). Osmotic regulatory substances in plant tissues exhibited similar trends. MDA and PRO contents in root and leaf tissues did not significantly differ under drought stress after inoculation. These results indicate that WZS021 enhances drought stress tolerance by improving the rhizosphere soil environment and physiological conditions in plant tissues. 3.2 WZS021 regulates differential gene expression in a drought environment Twelve samples were processed for transcriptome sequencing, generating 80.23 Gb of clean data. At least 5.77 Gb of clean data were generated for each sample, with a minimum of 93.77% of clean data achieving a quality score of Q30. Gene expression was quantified, and differentially expressed genes were identified based on their expression. The DEGs were further processed for functional annotation and enrichment analyses. A summary of the transcriptome sequencing data is provided in Table S4 . To investigate the effect of WZS021 on gene expression in sugarcane roots under drought stress, RNA-seq analysis was performed on sugarcane root samples subjected to the four different treatments. The overall distribution of gene expression levels in all samples was similar, with density peaks above 0.4 ( Fig. 2 A). PCA of transcript expression revealed that root samples from each treatment were grouped together, suggesting minimal differences between the three replicates of each treatment ( Fig. 2 B). The first two components accounted for 80.8% of the variation and distinguished the four differently treated samples without overlap, highlighting the significant impact of drought and inoculation on the gene expression profile of plant roots. According to DESeq2 analysis, compared to regular watering, 2887 DEGs were detected under drought stress conditions, of which 848 genes were upregulated and 2039 genes were downregulated ( Fig. 2 C). Under the inoculation conditions, 12,367 DEGs were produced, of which 3335 genes were up-regulated and 9032 genes were down regulated ( Fig. 2 D), indicating that the transcriptional changes in sugarcane roots after inoculation were much greater than those caused by drought stress. Under drought stress after inoculation, 3685 DEGs were differentially expressed in sugarcane roots, with 2039 DEGs up-regulated and 1646 DEGs down-regulated ( Fig. 2 E). Under inoculated conditions, drought stress caused the differential expression of 10,704 DEGs, with 7989 DEGs upregulated, and 2715 DEGs downregulated ( Fig. 2 F), suggesting that WZS021 helps sugarcane mobilize DEG expression in plant roots in response to drought stress. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, phenolpropanoid biosynthesis, MAPK signaling, starch and sucrose metabolism, plant pathway interactions, and other pathways ( Fig. 3 A–D). It is worth noting that under drought conditions, the top three pathways for number of upregulated genes after inoculation are phenolpropanoid biosynthesis (94, 14.6%), search and cross metabolism (48, 7.4%), and plant hormone signal transduction (40, 6.2%), indicating that phenolpropanoid biosynthesis is one of the important pathways by which WZS021 helps plants improve drought resistance ( Fig. 3 C). In terms of GO classification, DEGs in both inoculated and arid sugarcane roots were most enriched in biological processes, with the top three being the oxidative stress response, hydrogen peroxide catabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism, with more than 60 DEGs participating ( Fig. S1 ). Thus, WZS021 may directly participate in plant drought tolerance by upregulating the expression of these genes. To validate the RNA-seq results, qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of nine upregulated sugarcane genes. The results of qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated no significant differences from our RNA-seq data, and similar trends were observed for both upregulated and downregulated genes ( Fig. S2 ). These results confirmed the reliability of the RNA-seq data. 3.3 Overview of metabolome analyses LC-QTOF-based metabolomic analysis was used to obtain qualitative and quantitative assessments of the metabolites in the 12 samples under drought and inoculated conditions. A total of 9682 peaks were detected, with 917 annotated metabolites. Drought stress resulted in 647 DAMs in the root system, of which 363 were up-regulated and 284 were downregulated. Three metabolites with log 2 FC values > 23 were detected (upregulated: tetrahydrofurfuryl cinnamate, 2−phenylbutyrolactone, petunidin; downregulated: asparaginyl-asparagine) ( Fig. 4 A). A total of 639 DAMs were detected under inoculated conditions, of which 330 were upregulated and 309 were downregulated. Petunidin showed the largest difference (log 2 FC = 25.09) ( Fig. 4 B). When sugarcane was subjected to drought stress, inoculation resulted in the production of 529 DAMs in the root system, among which 274 were upregulated and 255 were downregulated. The top three downregulated metabolites were tetrahydrofurfuryl cinnamate, 2-Phenylbutyrolactone, and petunidin. Interestingly, these three metabolites were also the top three up-regulated metabolites in response to drought stress in the absence of WZS021 ( Fig. 4 C). After pre-inoculation, drought stress resulted in the identification of 546 DAMs, of which 296 metabolites were upregulated and 250 were downregulated. The largest fold downregulation was observed for petunidin ( Fig. 4 D). Joint KEGG enrichment analysis of the co-mapped pathways revealed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was significantly enriched in response to both drought and inoculation ( Fig. 5 ). In addition, under drought conditions, significant changes in the physiological conditions of sugarcane roots, stems, leaves, and rhizosphere soil ( Fig. 6 A), many DEGs were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction ( Fig. 6 B) and linoleic acid metabolism pathways in response to WZS021 inoculation. 3.4 Effects of WZS021 on DEGs and DAMs in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis under drought conditions DEGs and DAMs involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis changed significantly under drought stress. After WZS021 inoculation, 14 DAMs involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis or catabolism in sugarcane roots were identified. Among these, shikimate, phenylalanine, hydroxybenzoate, phenylacetate, and l-phenylalanine increased significantly, whereas transcinnamic acid, phenylacetylglutamine, and phenylethanol decreased significantly. After inoculation, the genes expressing phenylalanine ammonia-lyase ( PAL ), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase ( PAT ), shikimate kinase ( SK ), 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase ( DHS ), 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase ( hppD ), and amidase ( amiE ) were upregulated, while those expressing primary-amine oxidase ( PAO ), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ), and arogenate dehydratase ( ADT ) were downregulated, with significant changes observed ( Fig. 6 C). These changes in DEGs and DAMs affect the entire phenylpropanoid biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, aiding sugarcane in responding to water-deficient conditions. 4 Discussion Sugarcane is an important sugar and energy crop and drought is an abiotic stress factor that restricts its growth. Root systems play crucial roles in water and nutrient absorption by plants. Changes in the physicochemical properties of rhizosphere soil and changes in physiological, biochemical, transcriptomic, and metabolomic properties of root tissue are key indicators of enhanced drought tolerance in sugarcane. Under abiotic stress, nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are crucial for stimulating plant growth and development ( Mostofa et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2024 ). Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are essential nutrients for plant growth, and plant contents of these elements can reflect soil quality and nutrient limitations ( Bai et al., 2019 ). The formation and transport of sugars within plants are intimately linked to potassium levels, which enhance nitrogen metabolism and bolster plant stress resistance ( Saudy and El-Metwally, 2019 ). In the present study, AKP, DHA, and urease activities were significantly depressed in sugarcane rhizosphere soil under drought stress than under other tested conditions. Following inoculation with WZS021, AKP, DHA, and urease activities were significantly enhanced in rhizosphere soil. However, both drought stress and inoculation significantly reduced OM content, while significantly improving pH conditions. Under drought stress, AP and AK contents in rhizosphere soil significantly increased, whereas ammonia content was significantly elevated in inoculated rhizosphere soil, which may reflect the nitrogen fixation ability of WZS021. Under drought stress, osmoregulatory substances become key factors that influence plant stress resistance. These substances modulate plant osmotic capacity, reduce osmotic potential, decrease water potential, preserve cell turgor, and alleviate damage induced by drought stress ( Ozturk et al., 2021 ). Under water-deficient conditions, Bacillus sp. WM13-24 and Pseudomonas sp. M30-35 enhanced CAT and POD activities in Haloxylon ammodendron , and increased PRO and MDA contents ( He et al., 2021 ). We assessed alterations in antioxidant enzymes and osmoprotectants in plant tissues after inoculation with S. chartreuses WZS021 under drought stress. SOD, POD, CAT, MDA, and PRO levels in sugarcane roots, stems, and leaves were significantly affected by the combined effects of drought and inoculation. Regardless of whether WZS021 or water deficiency alone is being assessed, antioxidant enzyme activities and osmoregulatory substance levels increased, indicating that either single treatment induces a stress response in sugarcane. When sugarcane received both treatments simultaneously, a significant decrease in stress response effects was observed compared to the effect of either single treatment, indicating that inoculation can help plants adapt better to drought stress. Azotobacter croccum can enhance antioxidant enzyme activity and accumulate osmotic protectants in peppermint under drought conditions, effectively maintaining the balance of cell osmotic potential, preventing plant dehydration, and defending against drought stress ( Asghari et al., 2020 ). Inoculating barley with Providencia rettgeri improves drought stress tolerance indicators, including PRO, MDA, and hydrogen peroxide contents ( Ferioun et al., 2023 ). Under drought conditions, plants produce large amounts of ROS, which increase membrane lipid peroxidation ( Qi et al., 2018 ). In this study, SOD, POD, and CAT activities in sugarcane roots inoculated with WZS021 increased to varying degrees under drought stress. S. chartreuses WZS021 activated the protective enzyme system in sugarcane leaves and roots, thereby enhancing enzyme activity, inducing physiological resistance to drought stress, and balancing the production and scavenging of ROS within the plant. Inoculation with Bacillus safensis PM22 significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activity of maize plants and reduced their MDA content to alleviate the oxidative damage caused by abiotic stress, thereby enhancing plant stress resistance ( Azeem et al., 2022 ). The MDA content in sugarcane significantly increased under drought stress, indicating that drought damage to sugarcane cell membrane systems increased the MDA content of lipid peroxidation products in cell membranes. MDA content in roots, stems, and leaves of sugarcane inoculated with WZS021 was significantly lower than that in control, plant tissues, indicating that WZS021 significantly reduced the MDA content in sugarcane, reduced ROS accumulation, and alleviated damage caused by drought stress. This further demonstrates that WZS021 can directly enhance its ability to resist drought stress by regulating plant physiological and biochemical reactions. This study described a mechanism by which Streptomyces drives plant stress defense at the transcriptional level. Determining the regulatory network of Streptomyces in the sugarcane response to drought stress is important for improving sugarcane drought tolerance and enhancing land development and utilization. Differential and enrichment analyses were performed on the transcriptome data to reveal significant physiological changes that occur in sugarcane at the transcriptional level in response to drought stress, reflecting the mechanism by which Streptomyces helps sugarcane respond to drought stress. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is a critical pathway for plant resistance to drought stress. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) catalyzes the non-oxidative deamination of l-phenylalanine or tyrosine, producing trans-cinnamic acid, and ultimately generating coumaroyl-CoA, which enters the downstream metabolism of flavonoids, lignins, and coumarins ( Yadav et al., 2020 ). Transcriptome analysis indicated that under drought stress, the SoPAL s family genes were significantly upregulated compared to treatment with WZS021 alone, resulting in a significant increase in salicylic acid content in root metabolites ( Fig. 6 ). Plants synthesize salicylic acid usually via the isochorismate synthase pathway or PAL pathway, the main contribution pathway of salicylic acid synthesis vary among different plants ( Ullah et al., 2023 ; Yang et al., 2023 ). Based on the results of this study, it is hypothesized that PALs may regulate the synthesis of downstream metabolites in sugarcane to resist abiotic stress. In recent years, the rapid advancement of omics technologies has allowed numerous studies to clarify the extensive involvement of plant phenylpropane metabolism and its downstream products under various stress conditions at transcript, protein, and metabolite levels ( de Vries et al., 2021 ; Dong and Lin, 2021 ; Ramaroson et al., 2022 ). Drought induces ROS production, which leads to fortification of the cell wall, superoxide reactions, and other effects, resulting in significant gene upregulation within the plant-pathogen interaction pathway. The starch and sucrose metabolism pathways not only participate in plant growth and development, but also play an important role in tolerance to abiotic stresses ( Chen et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2023 ). In previous studies, WZS021 promoted the production of plant hormones including IAA and ethylene in sugarcane leaves ( Wang et al., 2019 ), which was confirmed by upregulation of plant hormone signal transduction-related gene expression levels in this study. This study employed KEGG gene enrichment analysis to identify the most upregulated 94 genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. The following pathways were identified: plant-pathogen interactions, starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction, involving 63, 48, and 40 genes, respectively. This suggests that Streptomyces systematically enhances sugarcane response to drought stress by upregulating genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interactions, plant hormone signal transduction, and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. This demonstrates the significant positive regulatory role of Streptomyces in the expression of osmotic adjustment, antioxidant systems, plant hormone regulation, and regulatory protein-coding genes during the sugarcane response to drought stress. These physiological, biochemical, and molecular processes have been confirmed to be crucial in numerous studies on plant drought stress responses ( Fox et al., 2018 ; Kumar et al., 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ). Genes involved in the regulation of tyrosine N-monooxygenase, peroxidase (PRX), and KDEL-tailed cysteine endopeptidases showed significantly elevated expression levels. KDEL-tailed cysteine endopeptidases are also involved in root development ( Rodríguez-García et al., 2024 ). Tyrosine N-monooxygenase and peroxidase are closely associated with plant responses to drought stress ( Lian et al., 2023 ; Wang et al., 2024 ). The xyloglucosyl transferase gene, a key player in the dynamics and mechanics of plant cell walls, is downregulated ( Hrmova et al., 2022 ), and the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase genes play a critical role in regulating abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis in higher plants ( Jia et al., 2022 ). Actin depolymerizing factor is primarily associated with plant resistance to biotic stress ( Sun et al., 2023 ; Xu et al., 2023 ). This may be because sugarcane is not only affected by drought stress but also stimulated by Streptomyces as a biotic stress. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that eliminate ROS produced in response to environmental stress. Flavonoids can enhance plant-microbial symbiosis to defend against stress and are an important way to improve plant stress resistance ( Wu et al., 2023 ). Drought can alter flavonoid content in the cell nucleus, and flavonoids work synergistically with plant hormones to help plants adapt to water deficiency ( Cai et al., 2023 ). In general, ROS production and scavenging within plants maintains a dynamic equilibrium. However, when plants face abiotic stresses such as drought and salt damage, this equilibrium is disrupted, causing rapid ROS accumulation and oxidative plant damage ( Ravi et al., 2023 ). Flavonoid metabolites exhibit strong antioxidant activities and protect plants from ROS. Drought stress can induce flavonoid accumulation and improve plant antioxidant capacity ( Li et al., 2021 ; Gao et al., 2023 ). Drought stress can induce accumulation of antioxidant metabolites including polyphenols and flavonoids in plant leaves and roots, thereby eliminating ROS ( Gharibi et al., 2019 ; Albergaria et al., 2020 ). These results demonstrate that phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, within the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway are crucial for enhancing plant drought resistance. Similarly, this study revealed that the antioxidant capacity of sugarcane leaves, stems, and roots significantly increased under drought stress in the presence of WZS021, potentially because suppression of ROS production by flavonoids and other phenolic compounds through WZS021 regulates the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway. It has long been recognized that amino acid accumulation is a hallmark plant response to abiotic stress, playing a critical role in stress resistance ( Ingrisano et al., 2023 ). Under osmotic stress, amino acids including proline and serine accumulate significantly in plant leaves ( Khan et al., 2020 ; Ozturk et al., 2021 ). Proline is a key osmotic regulator in plants responding to drought stress, with its levels indicating the extent of osmotic regulation against stress ( Lü et al., 2019 ). We found a significant increase in proline content in sugarcane roots from T2 to T4, indicating intensification of drought stress. Proline is synthesized in large quantities to regulate osmotic pressure, eliminate free radicals, and to act as a hydrophilic substance to reduce protein and enzyme degradation, thereby alleviating the damage caused by drought stress in sugarcane cells. Following drought stress, sugarcane undergoes a significant downregulation of amino acid metabolites ( Fig. 4 A), to reduce transpiration and slow growth to cope with drought stress in a way that conserves and reallocates resources. When WZS021 was applied under stress conditions, amino acid metabolites were predominantly upregulated ( Fig. 4 C). This modulation helps to regulate osmotic pressure, enhance water absorption, and maintain ionic homeostasis within the plant, thereby reducing drought-induced damage. Through the analysis of differential metabolites and related pathways, we identified alanine, aspartic acid, histidine, L-isoleucine, and saccharopine as key metabolites contributing to sugarcane drought resistance. Saccharopine is closely associated with glutamate, lysine, and proline synthesis, which aid plants in countering damage from abiotic stress ( Arruda and Barreto, 2020 ). Amino acid metabolic pathways are crucial for WZS021's role in enhancing sugarcane drought stress resistance by collaborating with other metabolic pathways to combat drought stress and ensure normal physiological functions. This study illustrates the role of WZS021 in modulating metabolic products and pathways during sugarcane's response to drought stress by analyzing the differential metabolites and pathways that actively respond to stress. The resulting data provide a reference for practical application of microorganisms in sugarcane water management, preventing long-term drought from reducing sugarcane quality and yield, and further unveiling the mechanisms by which WZS021 enhances sugarcane drought resistance. In conclusion, this study found that under the tested inoculation and drought stress conditions, the antioxidant capacity of different sugarcane tissues significantly increased. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses showed that the biosynthesis and metabolism of phenylalanine, flavonoids, and related gene transcription levels in sugarcane roots significantly increased after WZS021 inoculation under drought stress. Isolated inoculations can also simulate stress responses, including root growth, accelerated nitrogen metabolism, and phytohormone accumulation. WZS021 optimizes plant physiology and the rhizosphere nutritional environment, influencing key metabolic pathways including phenylalanine, flavonoids, and plant hormone signal transduction, thereby enhancing the drought resistance of sugarcane. Altogether with previous research, we can provide a scientific basis for the development of WZS021 as a microbial agent for enhancing plant drought resistance.
