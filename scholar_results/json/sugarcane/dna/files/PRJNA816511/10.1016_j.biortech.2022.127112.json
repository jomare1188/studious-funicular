          "Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant low-cost renewable carbon source for the production of biogas, which can subsequently be used as an energy source for heat and power generation and transport ( Kougias and Angelidaki, 2018; Ray et al., 2013 ). However, commercial production of biogas from lignocellulosic biomass is limited due to low biogas yield and productivity, a consequence of the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic biomass for digestion and operational issues in delivery and mixing of feedstocks. Many biomass pretreatment methods, such as liquid hot water (LHW), dilute acid (DA), alkaline, organosolv, ionic liquid and steam explosion have been explored to improve biomass digestibility ( Abraham et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2019 ). Among these methods, LHW, DA and alkaline pretreatments are commonly used because these pretreatments are relatively simple and low-cost. Nevertheless, the improvement in biogas yield and productivity from pretreated biomass are still limited by the presence of a significant portion of less digestible lignin.",
          "In order to further improve biomethane yield and productivity from lignocellulosic biomass, solid state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD, also called dry AD) processes containing relatively high substrate total solids (TS) loadings of ≥ 15% have been researched ( Lima et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2015 ). Biogas production kinetic models such as first-order, modified Gompertz, and Chen and Hashimoto models are useful tools for predicting biomethane yield and identification of key parameters affecting biomethane production from organic wastes ( Kafle and Chen, 2016; Li et al., 2019 ). However, to the authors’ knowledge, kinetic studies on SS-AD of pretreated lignocellulosic biomasses are very limited. In one of the very few studies, kinetics of SS-AD of pretreated sugarcane bagasse by LHW and aqueous glycerol was studied ( Lima et al., 2018 ). In that study, only pretreated solid residues were used for biomethane production, which would inevitably lead to reduced biomethane production based on initial biomass, since hydrolyzed and solubilized carbohydrates were not counted. The use of whole biomass slurry after pretreatment would increase the total methane yield. However, the whole biomass slurry contains potential AD inhibitors such as furfural and soluble phenolics generated from pretreatment ( Jönsson and Martín, 2016 ), which may reduce biomethane production, especially in SS-AD, due to the use of high solid loadings (resulting in high levels of inhibitors).",
          "In the AD process, biomethane is produced by methanogens while the synergistic effects from various microbial communities play a critical role. For instance, when lignocellulosic biomass is used, lignocellulolytic bacteria hydrolyze carbohydrates to sugars, followed by the production of acetic acid and other short chain fatty acids by acetogenic and acidogenic bacteria, respectively ( Sayara and Sánchez, 2019; Yang et al., 2015 ). The metabolites form short chain fatty acids are further converted to biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) by methanogenic archaea ( Sayara and Sánchez, 2019; Yang et al., 2015 ). Studies have shown that feedstock types and operational conditions affected microbial communities, and consequently biomethane production ( Dai et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019; Joyce et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018; Yi et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Understanding the role and dynamics of microbial communities in AD of different feedstocks is important for development of bioaugmentation strategies to improve biomethane production. For instance, bioaugmentation of cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii improved the relative abundances of hydrolytic bacterium Caldicoprobacter , several syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic Methanothermobacter , leading to enhanced biomethane production from steam-exploded birch biomass ( Mulat et al., 2018 ).",
          "Sugarcane is an important crop with an annual production of approximately 1.9 billion tonnes ( FAO, 2021 ). Sugarcane trash, including sugarcane tops and leaves, is a type of abundant lignocellulosic biomass. In the authors’ previous study, LHW, DA (dilute H 2 SO 4 ) and KOH pretreatments of sugarcane trash under 14 conditions (including one control without pretreatment) were studied at a low VS loading of 1% using the whole slurry samples to identify the optimal pretreatment conditions ( Ketsub et al., 2021 ). In the present study, the whole slurry samples of sugarcane trash prepared at the optimal conditions for LHW, DA and KOH pretreatments were directly used to produce biogas by SS-AD at a high TS loading of 15% to improve methane volumetric productivity. The effects pretreatment methods on biomethane production kinetics and microbial community dynamics were investigated. The biomethane production kinetic model was used to predict biomethane production. Key microbial communities responding to trash samples from different pretreatment methods were identified. The results from this study provided valuable information in understanding of SS-AD of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass and could lead to the development of new bioaugmentation strategies to improve biomethane production from lignocellulosic biomass pretreated by different methods."

Sugarcane trash was air-dried to<10% moisture, followed by reducing the length to 2–10 cm by a garden shredder. Size-reduced trash was placed in a sealed bag and stored at 4 °C until pretreatment and AD. Sludge for SS-AD in this present study was collected from a sludge digester for biogas production at a local municipal wastewater treatment plant in South East Queensland. The sludge sample was kept at 4 °C for no more than two weeks prior to the use in AD trials."

Pretreatment conditions were selected based on the authors’ previous study, which identified the optimal pretreatment condition for each pretreatment ( Ketsub et al., 2021 ). All pretreatments were conducted in a 7.5 L pretreatment reactor (Series 4554, Parr Instruments, US) with a liquid/solid mass ratio of 5:1. The liquid included water from trash and catalyst. Trash was soaked in the liquid solution with or without the catalyst for 15 min before loading the mixture to the reactor. The reactor was heated to the required temperature and maintained at the temperature for 30 min. After pretreatment, the reactor was cooled down to ∼60 °C before opening the reactor for collecting the pretreated trash. The solid and liquid fractions were separated by vacuum filtration and the weight of each fraction was recorded. The mass ratio of liquid to solid was calculated based on the weight of each fraction. The solid and liquid fractions were stored at 4 °C for later use."

Following mixing the substate and the sludge, the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.2 by 50% KOH and 98% H 2 SO 4 if required. Then the mixture was transferred to the 2 L Schott bottle and the headspace of the Schott bottle reactor was flushed with N 2 gas (99% pure) to generate an anaerobic condition. The SS-AD trials were performed in triplicate at 37 ± 1 °C in a temperature-controlled water bath. During AD, the Schott bottles were gently rotated to facilitate mass transfer every two days. Biogas in AD bottle headspace was sampled by gas chromatography (GC) syringe. The biogas volume generated from the AD process was determined by a water-filled manometer. Biogas composition was analysed by GC as described in the authors’ previous publication ( Ketsub et al., 2021 ). The biogas yield calculation was referred to the standard atmospheric condition and subtracted with the gas from the blank trial, which was conducted with sludge inoculum only."

DADA2 is the core tool in the ampliseq workflow, performing multiple quality control steps, including quality filtering, denoising, read pair merging and PCR chimera removal, then inferring Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) which are subsequently assigned to taxonomic groups ( Callahan et al., 2016 ).

              "A variety of R (v4.0.5 R Core Team, 2021) packages were used for sample and groupwise statistical analysis of ASV abundance and taxonomy. The main R package used was ampvis2, which was used to estimate and visualise alpha and beta diversity indices and microbial community structure ( Andersen et al., 2018 ). Alpha diversity indices include Shannon’s index and Simpson’s index. Shannon’s index uses both species richness and evenness to calculate the degree of uncertainty in predicting a species from a random subsample while Simpson’s index is the probability (thus the index range is between 0 and 1) that two randomly selected individuals from the same sample belong to the same species. Significant differences in alpha diversity scores within pretreatment groups was calculated with a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. For continuous variables (VAs, pH, and methane yield in SS-AD), Shannon’s and Simpson’s index scores were also used to construct linear regression models, for observing trends and relationships between subcategories of pretreatment groups. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was used to estimate beta diversity of the microbial community in this study and is based on the change in diversity of microbial communities from one pretreatment to another and from one time point to another. Significance of beta diversity differences per pretreatment was calculated using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Microbial community structure was shown in phylum and genus level for bacteria and archaea, respectively. Top ten of key taxa for bacteria and archaea were shortlisted in this study. The R package Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC) ( Lin and Peddada, 2020 ) was used to estimate differential abundance (presented as W scores) of each pretreatment by using untreated condition as the reference. Differential abundance results were shown in genus level in both bacteria and archaea. The genera which were significantly different from another pretreatment and had relative abundance > 3% were shortlisted in this study.

All pretreatments increased glucan content in pretreated fibre comparing to untreated trash. LHW and DA pretreatments led to reduced contents of hemicellulose in solid fractions but increased lignin contents due to hemicellulose removal and possible formation of pseudo lignins from carbohydrates ( Shinde et al., 2018 ). Through calculation of distributions of major biomass components, it was found that LHW and DA pretreatments also hydrolysed and/or degrade more carbohydrates from biomass while KOH pretreatment removed more lignin. In addition to monosugars and oligosaccharides, liquid fractions also contained sugar degradation products such as furfural and HMF."

              "Biogas production was undertaken using the SS-AD and the starting conditions of AD trials were shown in Table 2 . All the pretreated trash samples were used at TS contents of 15% though the VS contents varied slightly. The compositions and distribution of VS varied due to the use of different pretreatment methods. Digestible VS loadings were calculated with inclusion of total carbohydrates, acetyl groups, HMF and furfural though HMF and furfural could inhibit biogas production. Overall, KOH pretreatment led to a highest digestible VS loading of the four biomass samples including untreated trash though the levels of TS and VS loadings in all trials were same or similar. The highest digestible VS loading was attributed to the highest content of carbohydrates ( Table 2 ). LHW and DA pretreatments led to a similar level of digestible VS loadings though the distributions of digestible VS in solid and liquid fractions were different. Moreover, the AD substrate derived from the DA pretreatment had the highest levels of furfural and HMF, which were 0.34 g/kg and 0.14 g/kg AD mixture, respectively, while furfural was not detected in the substrate derived from KOH pretreatment (see e- supplementary material s).",
              "Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of biomethane production using untreated and pretreated trash samples. The modified Gompertz’s kinetic model was used to fit the biomethane data and the model parameters were summarised in Table 3 . Overall, the experimental data fitted with the model very well with R 2 values of 0.987 – 0.997. Based on the model, KOH pretreatment led to the highest predicted maximum biomethane yield ( G max ) of 214.2 L methane /kg VS and predicted maximum production rate ( R max ) of 6.9 L methane/kg VS/day, followed by DA and LHW pretreatments, respectively. The lowest G max and R max were achieved with untreated trash sample, which were only 165.4 L methane/kg VS and 4.1 L methane/kg VS/day, respectively. The results were in line with the digestible VS loading data shown in Table 2 , where the substrates derived from KOH pretreatment and untreated trash had the highest and lowest digestible VS loadings, respectively. The order of G max values of untreated and pretreated samples was also in line with the experimental biomethane data though G max and experimental results were not the same values.",
              "Furthermore, it was found that DA pretreatment led to the longest lag phase time ( λ ) of 6.2 days, followed by 2.8 days from untreated trash, 1.6 days from trash pretreated by LHW and 1.2 days by KOH pretreatment. The much longer lag phase of AD of trash pretreated by DA was related to the presence of highest levels of inhibitors, such as furfural and HMF, from pretreatment (see e- supplementary material s). In addition, the long lag phase of AD of trash pretreated by DA might also be related to the high availability of soluble and digestible VS. As shown in Table 2 , the loading of digestible VS in liquid derived from DA pretreatment was 1.04%, the highest of all the loadings. These soluble digestible VS can be rapidly converted to organic acids by acetogens and high levels of organic acids may have inhibited AD ( Siegert and Banks, 2005 ).",
              "In the authors’ previous study, the biogas production data from pretreated sugarcane trash did not fit well with the modified Gompertz’s model ( Ketsub et al., 2021 ). The different observation from the present study was likely attributed to different TS/VS loadings and different levels of inhibitors. In the previous study, the VS loadings were only 1% and lag phase was not obvious due to the low levels of inhibitors. In the present study, lag phase was observed in all conditions. The results from the present study was in line with the observation from a previous study on SS-AD of raw sugarcane bagasse, in which the modified Gompertz’s model fitted the experimental data well with a R 2 value of 0.976 ( Lima et al., 2018 ). However, in that study, the predicted biomethane yield (73.5 L/kg VS) and productivity (1.50 L/kg/day) were much lower than those achieved in this study because of the use of untreated biomass.",
              "Fig. 2 shows the levels of short chain volatile acids (VAs) and digestate pHs during SS-AD of untreated and pretreated trash. All the ADs had an initial pH of 7.0. However, in the AD process, production of VAs led to the differentiation of digestate pHs. In general, higher levels of total VAs corresponded to low digestate pH. On day 13, SS-AD of DA pretreated trash led to the highest level of total VAs (5.3 g/L) with acetic acid (2.4 g/L), butyric acid (0.9 g/L), and propionic acid (1.1 g/L) being the three major VAs, corresponding to a lowest pH of 6.6. In contrast, SS AD of LHW and KOH pretreated trash samples on day 13 only generated moderate levels of VAs while AD of untreated trash generated the lowest levels of VAs due to the low availability of digestible VS. On day 31, the total VAs in AD of DA pretreated trash were significantly reduced but were still at the highest level. On days 50 and 70, due to the depletion of highly digestible VS, the levels of VAs were at relatively low levels of no >0.2 g/L for all the ADs. It was also noted that ADs of KOH pretreated and untreated trash samples led to similar pH trends, which were ∼7.0 in day 13 and slightly increased to the range of 7.1–7.2 from day 31 till the end of AD.",
              "The high levels of total VAs on days 13 and 31 in AD of DA pretreated trash were likely due to the high levels of soluble and digestible VS ( Table 2 ), which led to the rapid production by acidogens and acetogens, and accumulation of VAs. This phenomenon was also observed in previous studies in AD of biomass pretreated by DA ( Achinas et al., 2019 ). Although VAs are the intermediates to produce biogas, high levels of VAs could inhibit the activities of methanogens and biogas production ( Siegert and Banks, 2005 ). However, with the prolonged AD time, microbial communities might adapt to these inhibitors (inhibitory effect of VAs and sugars degradation compounds) and even metabolise these inhibitors for biomethane production ( Palatsi et al., 2010; Pekařová et al., 2017 )."

In bacterial community, significant correlations ( p < 0.05) of bacterial alpha diversity with VAs were observed during SS-AD. This could be because bacteria play a critical role in hydrolysis of carbohydrate polymers, sugar assimilation hydrolysis and VAs generation in AD. Moreover, negative slope of the regression lines related to the correlations of bacterial diversity with pH indicated that high diversity of bacteria was related to low pH during SS-AD. Alpha diversity of bacterial community did not have significant correlations with methane yield ( p > 0.05), likely due to the role of bacteria in carbohydrate polymer hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis rather than methanogenesis. The diversity of bacteria indicated significant correlations with the intermediates ( e.g., VAs) in AD, rather than end-product – methane.",
                  "The positive correlations of bacterial community with VAs production observed in the present study aligned with previous observations. In one study, it was found that the abundances of some bacteria genera, e.g. , Lactobacillus, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12 , and Caproiciproducens increased with the increase in the concentrations of VAs, especially butyric acid and acetic acid while the significance of the correlations was not reported ( Li et al., 2022 ). In another study, four genera, Lactobacillus , Bacteroides , Clostridium sensu stricto and Clostridium IV were mainly found in AD along with high levels of VAs ( Zhou et al., 2021 ). Another previous study also reported that bacterial genera, e.g. , Clostridium and Bacteroides were related to VAs production in AD ( Lv et al., 2022 ). However, unlike the present study, the direct correlations of alpha diversity indexes with variables were not described and reported in previous studies.",
                  "Compared to bacterial community, the abundance of archaeal community was less relevant with VAs. Shannon’s index showed some significant correlations with some VAs ( p < 0.05) but Simpson’s index had no significant correlations with VAs ( p > 0.05). The correlations of alpha indexes of archaeal community with pH were not significant likely because archaeal community did not produce VAs in SS-AD. In contrast, the correlations of alpha diversity indexes of archaeal community with methane yield were significant because methanogens belonged to archaeal community.",
                  "PERMANOVA analysis was employed to understand the effect of pretreatment and AD time on microbial diversity. In this study, PCoA plots from Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was employed to distinguish microbial diversity between pretreatment methods and between AD time points. All groups PERMANOVA showed the overall dissimilarity of all groups while pairwise PERMANOVA specifically showed the dissimilarity of each selected pair in the group.",
                  "For bacterial community, Fig. 3 a and 3b show beta diversity of PCoA plots from Bray-Curtis dissimilarity grouped by pretreatment methods and AD time points, respectively. With the pretreatment group, both all groups PERMANOVA and pairwise PERMANOVA analyses indicated that bacterial diversity in each pretreatment was significantly different from each other ( p < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 a), indicating that pretreatment method significantly affected microbial responses in AD. With the AD time group, all groups PERMANOVA analyses showed that the overall dissimilarity of all bacterial groups was significant ( p < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 b). Pairwise PERMANOVA analysis showed that significant changes of bacterial community between day 0 and other selected AD time points and between early and late AD time ( p < 0.05, Day 13 vs Day 48, Day 13 vs Day 70). However, the changes were not significant between Day 13 and Day 31, and between the time points after Day 31 ( p > 0.05).",
                  "For the archaeal community group by pretreatment, all groups PERMANOVA analysis showed that the overall dissimilarity of all archaeal community was not significant ( p > 0.05) ( Fig. 3 c). Pairwise PERMANOVA analyses did not show the significant difference between pretreatments ( p > 0.05) though the changes were significant between untreated and pretreatments by DA and KOH ( p < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 c). For the archaeal community group by AD time, all groups PERMANOVA showed that the overall dissimilarity of all archaeal community was significant (p < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 d). Pairwise PERMANOVA analysis results were similar to those for the bacterial community group by AD time ( Fig. 3 d). Namely, the archaeal community changes were significant from Day 0 to the selected AD time points ( p < 0.05, all groups PERMANOVA) and between early and late AD time (pairwise PERMANOVA), but were not significant after 31 days of AD ( p > 0.05, pairwise PERMANOVA).",
                  "The present study showed that pretreatments had more significant effects on bacterial community than archaeal community and AD time had significant effects on both bacterial and archaeal communities. The effect of pretreatments on the profiles of microbial communities in the subsequent AD processes were previously reported but the observations varied among studies. For instance, it was reported that H 2 SO 4 -catalysed pretreatment of rice straw led to the change of microbial community compared to the use of untreated biomass in AD ( Mirmohamadsadeghi et al., 2021 ). Compared to the use of untreated biomass, the use of pretreated rice straw led to the decrease in the main bacterial family of Hyphomicrobiaceae but the increase in the families of Chromatiaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Clostridiaceae. For archaeal community, the use of pretreated rice straw increased Candidatus and Nitrososphaera . In another study, wheat straw was pretreated with acetic acid, sodium hydroxide, and calcium peroxide, followed by mixing with municipal sludge for methane production ( Kang et al., 2021 ). In that study, different microbial profiles using wheat straw pretreated with different methods and profile changes during AD were also observed. These different observations indicate that AD of lignocellulosic biomass for biogas production is a very complicated process. Many factors such as pretreatment methods, biomass type, AD type and operational conditions can affect microbial communities and biogas production."

                  "Following all groups and pairwise PERMANOVA analysis, key bacteria and archaea were identified for differential abundance analysis using R packages. Fig. 4 a showed relative proportion (%) of top 10 bacterial phyla from different pretreatments at different AD times. Firmicutes and Chloroflexi were relatively abundant compared to the other phyla in all conditions. Proteobacteria, Synergistetes, and Bacteroidetes were also found in lower abundance throughout the AD. Moreover, the other bacterial phyla were also observed, for example, Actinobacteria, Patescibacteria, Atribacteria, Armatimonadetes, Planctomycetes. Most of archaeal population belonged to phylum Euryarchaeota (see e- supplementary material s). Fig. 4 b showed relative proportion of archaeal community in genus level. Methanosaeta was the main genus in SS-AD of all trash samples. Methanosaeta is known as obligate aceticlastic methanogens ( Yang et al., 2020 ). This methanogen strictly uses acetate for methanogenesis. The results indicated that aceticlastic methanogenesis was the main pathway for methane formation in the SS-AD of pretreated sugarcane trash samples. Methanosarcina was the second most abundant genus in the archaeal community and its abundance increased along with prolonged SS-AD time using all the trash samples. Methanosarcina is a type of facultative aceticlastic methanogen ( Kurade et al., 2019 ), and it can utilise acetate and hydrogen/carbon dioxide for methane formation. Moreover, most of the rest methanogens, such as Methanospirillum , Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium belong to hydrogenotrophic methanogens ( Kurade et al., 2019 ).",
                  "Fig. 5 showed differential abundance (W score) of the genera which were significantly different from the other groups based on different pretreatments using ANCOM-BC method. In general, highly active genera (W score > 4) related to pretreatment methods were Bacillus , Fonticella , Anaerofustis , Anaerosalibacter , Sporanaerobacter , Blautia , Desulfotomaculum , Caproiciproducens , and Pelospora . In line with the major population, all these significant genera belonged to Firmicutes. Six out of previous nine genera were also significantly different regarding the time during SS-AD (see e- supplementary material s). Six genera included Bacillus , Fonticella , Anaerosalibacter , Blautia , Caproiciproducens , and Pelospora . The differential abundance of these genera was generally higher in the initial phase (day 13) compared to the other time points during SS-AD. Previously, it was reported that Caproiciproducens and Anaerosalibacter were able to produce VAs from carbohydrates ( Dione et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020 ), and Pelospora could produce VAs from other organic compounds, such as glutarate ( Yu et al., 2021 ). It was also reported that Bacillus had both acidogenic and acetogenic activities ( Ai et al., 2018 ). Moreover, bacteria in genera Fonticella and Blautia could produce acetate from organic compounds such as carbohydrates ( Fraj et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015 ). The acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria likely prefer the pretreated biomass in which carbohydrates are easy to access for hydrolysis. Fig. 5 b showed the significant archaeal genera grouped by different pretreatments. Methanofollis was found in SS-AD of sugarcane trash samples from LHW and DA pretreatments, which is a type of hydrogenotrophic methanogen ( Kurade et al., 2019 ). Methanosphaera genus was active in the SS-AD of trash pretreated by KOH, which is a type of methylotrophic methanogen ( Kurade et al., 2019 ). Methanofollis was also the significant methanogen regarding the time during SS-AD (see e- supplementary material s). The present study clearly showed that different pretreatment significantly affected the profiles of both bacterial and archaeal communities in SS-AD. It is anticipated that identification of the specific role of each microbial genus will lead to the development of bioaugmentation strategy to enhance biomethane production."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant low-cost renewable carbon source for the production of biogas, which can subsequently be used as an energy source for heat and power generation and transport ( Kougias and Angelidaki, 2018; Ray et al., 2013 ). However, commercial production of biogas from lignocellulosic biomass is limited due to low biogas yield and productivity, a consequence of the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic biomass for digestion and operational issues in delivery and mixing of feedstocks. Many biomass pretreatment methods, such as liquid hot water (LHW), dilute acid (DA), alkaline, organosolv, ionic liquid and steam explosion have been explored to improve biomass digestibility ( Abraham et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2019 ). Among these methods, LHW, DA and alkaline pretreatments are commonly used because these pretreatments are relatively simple and low-cost. Nevertheless, the improvement in biogas yield and productivity from pretreated biomass are still limited by the presence of a significant portion of less digestible lignin. In order to further improve biomethane yield and productivity from lignocellulosic biomass, solid state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD, also called dry AD) processes containing relatively high substrate total solids (TS) loadings of ≥ 15% have been researched ( Lima et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2015 ). Biogas production kinetic models such as first-order, modified Gompertz, and Chen and Hashimoto models are useful tools for predicting biomethane yield and identification of key parameters affecting biomethane production from organic wastes ( Kafle and Chen, 2016; Li et al., 2019 ). However, to the authors’ knowledge, kinetic studies on SS-AD of pretreated lignocellulosic biomasses are very limited. In one of the very few studies, kinetics of SS-AD of pretreated sugarcane bagasse by LHW and aqueous glycerol was studied ( Lima et al., 2018 ). In that study, only pretreated solid residues were used for biomethane production, which would inevitably lead to reduced biomethane production based on initial biomass, since hydrolyzed and solubilized carbohydrates were not counted. The use of whole biomass slurry after pretreatment would increase the total methane yield. However, the whole biomass slurry contains potential AD inhibitors such as furfural and soluble phenolics generated from pretreatment ( Jönsson and Martín, 2016 ), which may reduce biomethane production, especially in SS-AD, due to the use of high solid loadings (resulting in high levels of inhibitors). In the AD process, biomethane is produced by methanogens while the synergistic effects from various microbial communities play a critical role. For instance, when lignocellulosic biomass is used, lignocellulolytic bacteria hydrolyze carbohydrates to sugars, followed by the production of acetic acid and other short chain fatty acids by acetogenic and acidogenic bacteria, respectively ( Sayara and Sánchez, 2019; Yang et al., 2015 ). The metabolites form short chain fatty acids are further converted to biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) by methanogenic archaea ( Sayara and Sánchez, 2019; Yang et al., 2015 ). Studies have shown that feedstock types and operational conditions affected microbial communities, and consequently biomethane production ( Dai et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019; Joyce et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018; Yi et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Understanding the role and dynamics of microbial communities in AD of different feedstocks is important for development of bioaugmentation strategies to improve biomethane production. For instance, bioaugmentation of cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii improved the relative abundances of hydrolytic bacterium Caldicoprobacter , several syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic Methanothermobacter , leading to enhanced biomethane production from steam-exploded birch biomass ( Mulat et al., 2018 ). Sugarcane is an important crop with an annual production of approximately 1.9 billion tonnes ( FAO, 2021 ). Sugarcane trash, including sugarcane tops and leaves, is a type of abundant lignocellulosic biomass. In the authors’ previous study, LHW, DA (dilute H 2 SO 4 ) and KOH pretreatments of sugarcane trash under 14 conditions (including one control without pretreatment) were studied at a low VS loading of 1% using the whole slurry samples to identify the optimal pretreatment conditions ( Ketsub et al., 2021 ). In the present study, the whole slurry samples of sugarcane trash prepared at the optimal conditions for LHW, DA and KOH pretreatments were directly used to produce biogas by SS-AD at a high TS loading of 15% to improve methane volumetric productivity. The effects pretreatment methods on biomethane production kinetics and microbial community dynamics were investigated. The biomethane production kinetic model was used to predict biomethane production. Key microbial communities responding to trash samples from different pretreatment methods were identified. The results from this study provided valuable information in understanding of SS-AD of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass and could lead to the development of new bioaugmentation strategies to improve biomethane production from lignocellulosic biomass pretreated by different methods. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Sugarcane trash, including sugarcane leaves and tops, was collected from a sugarcane field in Mackay (Australia) following mechanical harvesting of sugarcane. Sugarcane trash was air-dried to<10% moisture, followed by reducing the length to 2–10 cm by a garden shredder. Size-reduced trash was placed in a sealed bag and stored at 4 °C until pretreatment and AD. Sludge for SS-AD in this present study was collected from a sludge digester for biogas production at a local municipal wastewater treatment plant in South East Queensland. The sludge sample was kept at 4 °C for no more than two weeks prior to the use in AD trials. 2.2 Pretreatment of sugarcane trash Sugarcane trash was pretreated by LHW (170 °C for 15 min), DA (150 °C for 15 min, 2.5 wt% H 2 SO 4 on trash) and KOH (150 °C for 60 min, 10 wt% KOH on trash) methods, respectively, prior to SS-AD. Pretreatment conditions were selected based on the authors’ previous study, which identified the optimal pretreatment condition for each pretreatment ( Ketsub et al., 2021 ). All pretreatments were conducted in a 7.5 L pretreatment reactor (Series 4554, Parr Instruments, US) with a liquid/solid mass ratio of 5:1. The liquid included water from trash and catalyst. Trash was soaked in the liquid solution with or without the catalyst for 15 min before loading the mixture to the reactor. The reactor was heated to the required temperature and maintained at the temperature for 30 min. After pretreatment, the reactor was cooled down to ∼60 °C before opening the reactor for collecting the pretreated trash. The solid and liquid fractions were separated by vacuum filtration and the weight of each fraction was recorded. The mass ratio of liquid to solid was calculated based on the weight of each fraction. The solid and liquid fractions were stored at 4 °C for later use. 2.3 Solid state anaerobic digestion trials Subsamples of solid and liquid fractions were mixed according to their mass ratios as determined in 2.2 after pretreatment and separation. The mixtures were neutralized to pH 7.0 prior to inoculation of sludge to start SS-AD. An inoculum to substrate volatile solids (VS) ratio (ISR) of 1:2 was used for all the AD trials. Exogenous nutrients were not added into the AD trials. The AD trials were conducted in 2 L Schott bottle with rubber septum-seal lid containing ∼200 g mixture including 15% total solids (TS) by weight. The substrates and inoculum characteristics were shown in Table 1 . Prior to inoculation of the sludge to start the AD trials, the sludge was reactivated at 37 °C for 5 days. Following mixing the substate and the sludge, the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.2 by 50% KOH and 98% H 2 SO 4 if required. Then the mixture was transferred to the 2 L Schott bottle and the headspace of the Schott bottle reactor was flushed with N 2 gas (99% pure) to generate an anaerobic condition. The SS-AD trials were performed in triplicate at 37 ± 1 °C in a temperature-controlled water bath. During AD, the Schott bottles were gently rotated to facilitate mass transfer every two days. Biogas in AD bottle headspace was sampled by gas chromatography (GC) syringe. The biogas volume generated from the AD process was determined by a water-filled manometer. Biogas composition was analysed by GC as described in the authors’ previous publication ( Ketsub et al., 2021 ). The biogas yield calculation was referred to the standard atmospheric condition and subtracted with the gas from the blank trial, which was conducted with sludge inoculum only. 2.4 Model development for solid state anaerobic digestion Biogas yields were plotted over the AD time and the data were fitted to modified Gompertz’s model ( Li et al., 2019 ) to determine kinetic parameters of biogas production. Modified Gompertz’s model equation is shown as the following: G t = G 0 × exp ( - exp ( ( R max × e ) / G 0 ) ( λ - - t ) + 1 ) ) . where G t is the cumulative methane yield (mL/g VS), G 0 is maximum methane potential (mL/g VS), R max is the maximum methane production rate (mL/g VS/day), λ is the lag time (day) and t is anaerobic digestion time (day). 2.5 General sample characterisation Samples were dried at 105 °C until constant weights for determination of TS contents. Dried samples were further heated and burned at 550 °C for 3 h and the weight loss was recorded to calculate the contents of VS in initial biomass. Biomass compositions of trash samples were determined according to a standard method developed by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( Sluiter et al., 2008 ). Sugars, furans such as furfural and organic acid acids such as acetic acid were determined by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods according to a previous publication of the authors ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). Briefly, one Waters HPLC system equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector (Waters 410, US) and a SP810 carbohydrate column (300 mm × 8.0 mm, Shodex, Japan) was used for sugar analysis with the use of water as a mobile phase. The other Waters HPLC system equipped with a RI detector and an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 mm × 8.0 mm, Bio-Rad, US) was used for analysis of sugar degradation products with the use of 5 mM H 2 SO 4 as a mobile phase. General statistical analysis of the data was performed by One-way ANOVA using Minitab® version 17. 2.6 DNA extraction Samples (approximately 2 g) were withdrawn at day 0, 13, 31, 50 and 70 in the SS-AD trials for DNA extraction and subsequent genomic analysis. Samples from triplicate SS-AD trials were pooled equally prior to genomic DNA extraction. After pooling, the samples were boiled at 100 °C for 10 min to facilitate microbial cell disruption prior to DNA extraction using a Favorgen, FavorPrep Soil DNA Isolation Mini kit. 2.7 16S rRNA library preparation and sequencing The extracted DNA was used for amplification and sequencing of the hypervariable V3/V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Primers used to generate bacteria amplicons were F:5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and R:5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC, obtained from the Illumina 16S library preparation manual ( Illumina, 2013 ). Primers for archaea were F:5′-CCCTAYGGGGYGCASCAG and R:5′- GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT, which were designed in a 2019 study to amplify novel and diverse archaeal taxa ( Bahram et al., 2019 ). Two PCR purification steps were performed according to Illumina MiSeq 16S metagenome sequencing library preparation protocol ( Illumina, 2013 ). After the initial 25 cycle PCR, 16S amplicons were purified with AMPure XP beads and washed with 80% ethanol for the second PCR. The second PCR was performed by attaching dual indices to the Illumina sequence adapters using the Nextera XT index kit, then run for 8 cycles. Amplicons were then quantified by Varioskan™ LUX microplate reader before being pooled for PE 300 sequencing on a MiSeq platform. 2.8 Sequence processing Initial 16S profiling of the sequenced 16S rRNA amplicons was completed using a Nextflow ( https://www.nextflow.io/ ) pipeline: ampliseq v1.2.0 ( Straub et al., 2020 ). Ampliseq combines a series of analysis tools and processes into a curated and reproducible workflow, which are, briefly, as follows: raw sequence reads are assessed for quality using FastQC ( Andrews, 2010 ) and primer sequences are trimmed from reads using cutadapt v2.8 ( Martin, 2011 ). DADA2 is the core tool in the ampliseq workflow, performing multiple quality control steps, including quality filtering, denoising, read pair merging and PCR chimera removal, then inferring Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) which are subsequently assigned to taxonomic groups ( Callahan et al., 2016 ). DADA2 taxonomy assignment was based on the Silva v132 database ( Quast et al., 2012 ). 2.9 Alpha diversity, beta diversity and microbial community structure analysis A variety of R (v4.0.5 R Core Team, 2021) packages were used for sample and groupwise statistical analysis of ASV abundance and taxonomy. The main R package used was ampvis2, which was used to estimate and visualise alpha and beta diversity indices and microbial community structure ( Andersen et al., 2018 ). Alpha diversity indices include Shannon’s index and Simpson’s index. Shannon’s index uses both species richness and evenness to calculate the degree of uncertainty in predicting a species from a random subsample while Simpson’s index is the probability (thus the index range is between 0 and 1) that two randomly selected individuals from the same sample belong to the same species. Significant differences in alpha diversity scores within pretreatment groups was calculated with a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. For continuous variables (VAs, pH, and methane yield in SS-AD), Shannon’s and Simpson’s index scores were also used to construct linear regression models, for observing trends and relationships between subcategories of pretreatment groups. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was used to estimate beta diversity of the microbial community in this study and is based on the change in diversity of microbial communities from one pretreatment to another and from one time point to another. Significance of beta diversity differences per pretreatment was calculated using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Microbial community structure was shown in phylum and genus level for bacteria and archaea, respectively. Top ten of key taxa for bacteria and archaea were shortlisted in this study. The R package Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC) ( Lin and Peddada, 2020 ) was used to estimate differential abundance (presented as W scores) of each pretreatment by using untreated condition as the reference. Differential abundance results were shown in genus level in both bacteria and archaea. The genera which were significantly different from another pretreatment and had relative abundance > 3% were shortlisted in this study. The results were considered as significant with p -values < 0.05. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Effect of pretreatment on biomass composition and component distribution Table 1 shows biomass composition in solid residues and distribution of major components and their derivatives in solid and liquid fractions after pretreatment. All pretreatments increased glucan content in pretreated fibre comparing to untreated trash. LHW and DA pretreatments led to reduced contents of hemicellulose in solid fractions but increased lignin contents due to hemicellulose removal and possible formation of pseudo lignins from carbohydrates ( Shinde et al., 2018 ). Through calculation of distributions of major biomass components, it was found that LHW and DA pretreatments also hydrolysed and/or degrade more carbohydrates from biomass while KOH pretreatment removed more lignin. In addition to monosugars and oligosaccharides, liquid fractions also contained sugar degradation products such as furfural and HMF. 3.2 Solid state anaerobic digestion of pretreated sugarcane trash for biomethane production Biogas production was undertaken using the SS-AD and the starting conditions of AD trials were shown in Table 2 . All the pretreated trash samples were used at TS contents of 15% though the VS contents varied slightly. The compositions and distribution of VS varied due to the use of different pretreatment methods. Digestible VS loadings were calculated with inclusion of total carbohydrates, acetyl groups, HMF and furfural though HMF and furfural could inhibit biogas production. Overall, KOH pretreatment led to a highest digestible VS loading of the four biomass samples including untreated trash though the levels of TS and VS loadings in all trials were same or similar. The highest digestible VS loading was attributed to the highest content of carbohydrates ( Table 2 ). LHW and DA pretreatments led to a similar level of digestible VS loadings though the distributions of digestible VS in solid and liquid fractions were different. Moreover, the AD substrate derived from the DA pretreatment had the highest levels of furfural and HMF, which were 0.34 g/kg and 0.14 g/kg AD mixture, respectively, while furfural was not detected in the substrate derived from KOH pretreatment (see e- supplementary material s). Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of biomethane production using untreated and pretreated trash samples. The modified Gompertz’s kinetic model was used to fit the biomethane data and the model parameters were summarised in Table 3 . Overall, the experimental data fitted with the model very well with R 2 values of 0.987 – 0.997. Based on the model, KOH pretreatment led to the highest predicted maximum biomethane yield ( G max ) of 214.2 L methane /kg VS and predicted maximum production rate ( R max ) of 6.9 L methane/kg VS/day, followed by DA and LHW pretreatments, respectively. The lowest G max and R max were achieved with untreated trash sample, which were only 165.4 L methane/kg VS and 4.1 L methane/kg VS/day, respectively. The results were in line with the digestible VS loading data shown in Table 2 , where the substrates derived from KOH pretreatment and untreated trash had the highest and lowest digestible VS loadings, respectively. The order of G max values of untreated and pretreated samples was also in line with the experimental biomethane data though G max and experimental results were not the same values. Furthermore, it was found that DA pretreatment led to the longest lag phase time ( λ ) of 6.2 days, followed by 2.8 days from untreated trash, 1.6 days from trash pretreated by LHW and 1.2 days by KOH pretreatment. The much longer lag phase of AD of trash pretreated by DA was related to the presence of highest levels of inhibitors, such as furfural and HMF, from pretreatment (see e- supplementary material s). In addition, the long lag phase of AD of trash pretreated by DA might also be related to the high availability of soluble and digestible VS. As shown in Table 2 , the loading of digestible VS in liquid derived from DA pretreatment was 1.04%, the highest of all the loadings. These soluble digestible VS can be rapidly converted to organic acids by acetogens and high levels of organic acids may have inhibited AD ( Siegert and Banks, 2005 ). In the authors’ previous study, the biogas production data from pretreated sugarcane trash did not fit well with the modified Gompertz’s model ( Ketsub et al., 2021 ). The different observation from the present study was likely attributed to different TS/VS loadings and different levels of inhibitors. In the previous study, the VS loadings were only 1% and lag phase was not obvious due to the low levels of inhibitors. In the present study, lag phase was observed in all conditions. The results from the present study was in line with the observation from a previous study on SS-AD of raw sugarcane bagasse, in which the modified Gompertz’s model fitted the experimental data well with a R 2 value of 0.976 ( Lima et al., 2018 ). However, in that study, the predicted biomethane yield (73.5 L/kg VS) and productivity (1.50 L/kg/day) were much lower than those achieved in this study because of the use of untreated biomass. Fig. 2 shows the levels of short chain volatile acids (VAs) and digestate pHs during SS-AD of untreated and pretreated trash. All the ADs had an initial pH of 7.0. However, in the AD process, production of VAs led to the differentiation of digestate pHs. In general, higher levels of total VAs corresponded to low digestate pH. On day 13, SS-AD of DA pretreated trash led to the highest level of total VAs (5.3 g/L) with acetic acid (2.4 g/L), butyric acid (0.9 g/L), and propionic acid (1.1 g/L) being the three major VAs, corresponding to a lowest pH of 6.6. In contrast, SS AD of LHW and KOH pretreated trash samples on day 13 only generated moderate levels of VAs while AD of untreated trash generated the lowest levels of VAs due to the low availability of digestible VS. On day 31, the total VAs in AD of DA pretreated trash were significantly reduced but were still at the highest level. On days 50 and 70, due to the depletion of highly digestible VS, the levels of VAs were at relatively low levels of no >0.2 g/L for all the ADs. It was also noted that ADs of KOH pretreated and untreated trash samples led to similar pH trends, which were ∼7.0 in day 13 and slightly increased to the range of 7.1–7.2 from day 31 till the end of AD. The high levels of total VAs on days 13 and 31 in AD of DA pretreated trash were likely due to the high levels of soluble and digestible VS ( Table 2 ), which led to the rapid production by acidogens and acetogens, and accumulation of VAs. This phenomenon was also observed in previous studies in AD of biomass pretreated by DA ( Achinas et al., 2019 ). Although VAs are the intermediates to produce biogas, high levels of VAs could inhibit the activities of methanogens and biogas production ( Siegert and Banks, 2005 ). However, with the prolonged AD time, microbial communities might adapt to these inhibitors (inhibitory effect of VAs and sugars degradation compounds) and even metabolise these inhibitors for biomethane production ( Palatsi et al., 2010; Pekařová et al., 2017 ). 3.3 Dynamic changes of microbial communities in solid state anaerobic digestion of trash samples The microbial communities were monitored in SS-AD of untreated and pretreated trash samples. Both bacterial and archaeal communities were investigated. The former communities are mainly bacteria with feedstock hydrolytic and acidogenic/acetogenic functions while the latter communities are largely methanogens. 3.3.1 Diversity correlation analysis Table 4 shows the significance level and correlation from generalised linear regression model between the scatter plot of alpha diversity indexes (Shannon’s index and Simpson’s index) and corresponding variables at different time. In bacterial community, significant correlations ( p < 0.05) of bacterial alpha diversity with VAs were observed during SS-AD. This could be because bacteria play a critical role in hydrolysis of carbohydrate polymers, sugar assimilation hydrolysis and VAs generation in AD. Moreover, negative slope of the regression lines related to the correlations of bacterial diversity with pH indicated that high diversity of bacteria was related to low pH during SS-AD. Alpha diversity of bacterial community did not have significant correlations with methane yield ( p > 0.05), likely due to the role of bacteria in carbohydrate polymer hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis rather than methanogenesis. The diversity of bacteria indicated significant correlations with the intermediates ( e.g., VAs) in AD, rather than end-product – methane. The positive correlations of bacterial community with VAs production observed in the present study aligned with previous observations. In one study, it was found that the abundances of some bacteria genera, e.g. , Lactobacillus, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12 , and Caproiciproducens increased with the increase in the concentrations of VAs, especially butyric acid and acetic acid while the significance of the correlations was not reported ( Li et al., 2022 ). In another study, four genera, Lactobacillus , Bacteroides , Clostridium sensu stricto and Clostridium IV were mainly found in AD along with high levels of VAs ( Zhou et al., 2021 ). Another previous study also reported that bacterial genera, e.g. , Clostridium and Bacteroides were related to VAs production in AD ( Lv et al., 2022 ). However, unlike the present study, the direct correlations of alpha diversity indexes with variables were not described and reported in previous studies. Compared to bacterial community, the abundance of archaeal community was less relevant with VAs. Shannon’s index showed some significant correlations with some VAs ( p < 0.05) but Simpson’s index had no significant correlations with VAs ( p > 0.05). The correlations of alpha indexes of archaeal community with pH were not significant likely because archaeal community did not produce VAs in SS-AD. In contrast, the correlations of alpha diversity indexes of archaeal community with methane yield were significant because methanogens belonged to archaeal community. PERMANOVA analysis was employed to understand the effect of pretreatment and AD time on microbial diversity. In this study, PCoA plots from Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was employed to distinguish microbial diversity between pretreatment methods and between AD time points. All groups PERMANOVA showed the overall dissimilarity of all groups while pairwise PERMANOVA specifically showed the dissimilarity of each selected pair in the group. For bacterial community, Fig. 3 a and 3b show beta diversity of PCoA plots from Bray-Curtis dissimilarity grouped by pretreatment methods and AD time points, respectively. With the pretreatment group, both all groups PERMANOVA and pairwise PERMANOVA analyses indicated that bacterial diversity in each pretreatment was significantly different from each other ( p < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 a), indicating that pretreatment method significantly affected microbial responses in AD. With the AD time group, all groups PERMANOVA analyses showed that the overall dissimilarity of all bacterial groups was significant ( p < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 b). Pairwise PERMANOVA analysis showed that significant changes of bacterial community between day 0 and other selected AD time points and between early and late AD time ( p < 0.05, Day 13 vs Day 48, Day 13 vs Day 70). However, the changes were not significant between Day 13 and Day 31, and between the time points after Day 31 ( p > 0.05). For the archaeal community group by pretreatment, all groups PERMANOVA analysis showed that the overall dissimilarity of all archaeal community was not significant ( p > 0.05) ( Fig. 3 c). Pairwise PERMANOVA analyses did not show the significant difference between pretreatments ( p > 0.05) though the changes were significant between untreated and pretreatments by DA and KOH ( p < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 c). For the archaeal community group by AD time, all groups PERMANOVA showed that the overall dissimilarity of all archaeal community was significant (p < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 d). Pairwise PERMANOVA analysis results were similar to those for the bacterial community group by AD time ( Fig. 3 d). Namely, the archaeal community changes were significant from Day 0 to the selected AD time points ( p < 0.05, all groups PERMANOVA) and between early and late AD time (pairwise PERMANOVA), but were not significant after 31 days of AD ( p > 0.05, pairwise PERMANOVA). The present study showed that pretreatments had more significant effects on bacterial community than archaeal community and AD time had significant effects on both bacterial and archaeal communities. The effect of pretreatments on the profiles of microbial communities in the subsequent AD processes were previously reported but the observations varied among studies. For instance, it was reported that H 2 SO 4 -catalysed pretreatment of rice straw led to the change of microbial community compared to the use of untreated biomass in AD ( Mirmohamadsadeghi et al., 2021 ). Compared to the use of untreated biomass, the use of pretreated rice straw led to the decrease in the main bacterial family of Hyphomicrobiaceae but the increase in the families of Chromatiaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Clostridiaceae. For archaeal community, the use of pretreated rice straw increased Candidatus and Nitrososphaera . In another study, wheat straw was pretreated with acetic acid, sodium hydroxide, and calcium peroxide, followed by mixing with municipal sludge for methane production ( Kang et al., 2021 ). In that study, different microbial profiles using wheat straw pretreated with different methods and profile changes during AD were also observed. These different observations indicate that AD of lignocellulosic biomass for biogas production is a very complicated process. Many factors such as pretreatment methods, biomass type, AD type and operational conditions can affect microbial communities and biogas production. 3.3.2 Community structure and differential abundance Following all groups and pairwise PERMANOVA analysis, key bacteria and archaea were identified for differential abundance analysis using R packages. Fig. 4 a showed relative proportion (%) of top 10 bacterial phyla from different pretreatments at different AD times. Firmicutes and Chloroflexi were relatively abundant compared to the other phyla in all conditions. Proteobacteria, Synergistetes, and Bacteroidetes were also found in lower abundance throughout the AD. Moreover, the other bacterial phyla were also observed, for example, Actinobacteria, Patescibacteria, Atribacteria, Armatimonadetes, Planctomycetes. Most of archaeal population belonged to phylum Euryarchaeota (see e- supplementary material s). Fig. 4 b showed relative proportion of archaeal community in genus level. Methanosaeta was the main genus in SS-AD of all trash samples. Methanosaeta is known as obligate aceticlastic methanogens ( Yang et al., 2020 ). This methanogen strictly uses acetate for methanogenesis. The results indicated that aceticlastic methanogenesis was the main pathway for methane formation in the SS-AD of pretreated sugarcane trash samples. Methanosarcina was the second most abundant genus in the archaeal community and its abundance increased along with prolonged SS-AD time using all the trash samples. Methanosarcina is a type of facultative aceticlastic methanogen ( Kurade et al., 2019 ), and it can utilise acetate and hydrogen/carbon dioxide for methane formation. Moreover, most of the rest methanogens, such as Methanospirillum , Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium belong to hydrogenotrophic methanogens ( Kurade et al., 2019 ). Fig. 5 showed differential abundance (W score) of the genera which were significantly different from the other groups based on different pretreatments using ANCOM-BC method. In general, highly active genera (W score > 4) related to pretreatment methods were Bacillus , Fonticella , Anaerofustis , Anaerosalibacter , Sporanaerobacter , Blautia , Desulfotomaculum , Caproiciproducens , and Pelospora . In line with the major population, all these significant genera belonged to Firmicutes. Six out of previous nine genera were also significantly different regarding the time during SS-AD (see e- supplementary material s). Six genera included Bacillus , Fonticella , Anaerosalibacter , Blautia , Caproiciproducens , and Pelospora . The differential abundance of these genera was generally higher in the initial phase (day 13) compared to the other time points during SS-AD. Previously, it was reported that Caproiciproducens and Anaerosalibacter were able to produce VAs from carbohydrates ( Dione et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020 ), and Pelospora could produce VAs from other organic compounds, such as glutarate ( Yu et al., 2021 ). It was also reported that Bacillus had both acidogenic and acetogenic activities ( Ai et al., 2018 ). Moreover, bacteria in genera Fonticella and Blautia could produce acetate from organic compounds such as carbohydrates ( Fraj et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015 ). The acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria likely prefer the pretreated biomass in which carbohydrates are easy to access for hydrolysis. Fig. 5 b showed the significant archaeal genera grouped by different pretreatments. Methanofollis was found in SS-AD of sugarcane trash samples from LHW and DA pretreatments, which is a type of hydrogenotrophic methanogen ( Kurade et al., 2019 ). Methanosphaera genus was active in the SS-AD of trash pretreated by KOH, which is a type of methylotrophic methanogen ( Kurade et al., 2019 ). Methanofollis was also the significant methanogen regarding the time during SS-AD (see e- supplementary material s). The present study clearly showed that different pretreatment significantly affected the profiles of both bacterial and archaeal communities in SS-AD. It is anticipated that identification of the specific role of each microbial genus will lead to the development of bioaugmentation strategy to enhance biomethane production. 4 Conclusions In this study, SS-AD of untreated sugarcane trash and trash samples pretreated by LHW, DA and KOH was studied in terms of biomethane production kinetics and microbial community dynamics. Biomethane production data fitted the modified Gompertz’s model very well and KOH pretreatment led to the highest methane yield and production rate with short lag phase. Microbial community study revealed bacteria significantly related to VAs while archaea significantly related with methane production. Moreover, significant genera regarding KOH pretreatment were identified. These findings provided fundamental microbiome information and can be used for bioaugmentation development to improve biomethane production using pretreated lignocellulose.
