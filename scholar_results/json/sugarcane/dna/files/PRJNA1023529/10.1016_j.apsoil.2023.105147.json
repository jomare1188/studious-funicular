    "full_text": "Accurate measurement of decomposition of fine roots in forests is important for understanding nutrient cycling, carbon dynamics and biotic responses; however, various sources of error or bias interfere with commonly used approaches. Most studies of fine root decomposition have used the buried root litter bag method, but this method may underestimate decay rates based on comparisons with the less disruptive, intact soil core approach. We compared these two methods for one year for seven temperate forest trees growing in twelve monospecific plantations in central New York. The experimental design included four species that form arbuscular mycorrhizae (sugar maple, red maple, cherry, tulip poplar) and three with ectomycorrhizae (pine, spruce, oak). We also examined macronutrients (N, P) release and fungal community composition of decaying fine roots using Illumina sequencing. Across the seven species and 12 plots, fine root decay rate was significantly higher for intact cores than litter bags, with the difference being approximately 12 %, a smaller disparity than that observed in previous comparisons. However, one species (Norway spruce) showed the opposite trend. Similarly, N and P release from decaying roots was significantly greater for the intact core method, but again with an exception (red oak). No consistent effects of mycorrhizal type on the method effect or decay rate and nutrient release were detected. Fungal communities in decaying roots differed between the two methods; nevertheless, Mycena spp. dominated most plots for both methods. These results further emphasize the notion that decay rates and nutrient mobilization of fine roots in forests are usually underestimated by the litter bag approach."

          "Forest ecosystems store a large amount of Earth's terrestrial carbon (about 860 Pg; Pan et al., 2011 ). Forest soils comprise a high proportion of this forest carbon (about 380 Pg or 44 %), representing nearly 17 % of the total global C stock in terrestrial ecosystems ( Pan et al., 2013 ; Scharlemann et al., 2014 ). The three principal inputs of carbon to forest soils include aboveground detritus, belowground detritus (root mortality), and rhizosphere carbon flux. Although fine roots represent only a small proportion of the total biomass in forests, their short lifespans and rapid turnover result in a large proportion of the carbon input to the soil ( Jackson et al., 1996 ); for example, root inputs to relatively stable soil organic C stocks have been estimated to be five times greater than for aboveground detritus ( Jackson et al., 2017 ). Thus, understanding the process of decomposition of forest roots is important for evaluating global carbon dynamics. However, due to methodological challenges, the rates and controls of fine root decomposition are still uncertain. Depending upon the decay rates assumed, the contribution of fine roots to soil carbon stocks could vary considerably ( Clemmensen et al., 2013 ).",
          "The traditional litter bag is the most common method for measuring the decomposition rate of fine roots; the approach is widely used for aboveground detritus ( Karberg et al., 2008 ). Fine roots are excised from soil, prepared (e.g., air dried), and returned to the soil to incubate within fine mesh bags (e.g., 50–100 um mesh), which prevent the loss of small fragments or entry of soil particles, both of which would confound the estimation of weight loss. This method offers a simple, low-cost approach for estimating fine root decomposition rates, especially for assessing treatment effects and species differences in decomposition ( Freschet et al., 2021 ); however, this method may introduce important artifacts that could cause measurement error or bias. Early studies using this method indicated unexpectedly slow decay for both temperate conifer and broadleaf deciduous tree roots ( Fogel and Hunt, 1979 ; McClaugherty et al., 1984 ). McClaugherty et al. (1984) noted likely artifacts resulting from the root litter bag method, especially the condition of the root samples at the initiation of studies and the composition of decomposer communities. For example, the composition of both the microbial and faunal community of decomposers may be considerably different from those of roots senescing naturally and decaying within their intact rhizosphere ( Li et al., 2010 ; Li et al., 2015 ; Luo et al., 2017 Freschet et al., 2021 ). An alternative approach to the root litter bag method is the intact core method in which loss of mass and chemical changes are estimated for dead roots contained in soil cores ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ). This method is labor intensive, requiring accurate and precise measurements of fine root biomass at the stand level. The method is suitable for measuring individual species decay rates only for monospecific or plantation forests. However, the limitation for the litter bag method that the fine roots decay in the absence of their rhizosphere has been posited to justify the higher expense of the intact core method ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ). Indeed, direct comparisons of decay rates of fine roots of forest trees using these two approaches have consistently reported significantly higher decay rates for the intact core method than the root litterbag method ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ; Sun et al., 2013 ; Li et al., 2015 ; Luo et al., 2017 ; Freschet et al., 2021 ).",
          "A myriad of environmental and biotic factors affects the decay rates of fine roots in forests. Similar to leaf litter, temperature, moisture and substrate quality are undoubtedly important controlling factors ( Silver and Miya, 2001 ; See et al., 2019 ). In general, fine root litter usually exhibits lower decay rates than leaf litter of the same species, a difference that appears to be associated in part with substrate quality and secondary chemistry ( Sun et al., 2018 ; Guo et al., 2021 ). The role of root size or order is not fully understood; for example, some but not all studies indicate higher decay rates for order 3–4 than order 1–2 fine roots ( Goebel et al., 2011 ; Wang et al., 2019 ), possibly reflecting subtle differences in substrate chemistry ( Beidler and Pritchard, 2017 ). The relative roles of different microbial and faunal groups in fine root decay are not well understood. Recent surveys using molecular techniques have quantified the complex microbial communities colonizing decaying fine roots ( Herzog et al., 2019 ) and the succession of bacterial and fungal decomposers ( Kohout et al., 2018 ). Among the latter are endophytes, saprotrophs as well as mycorrhizal fungi. The effects of mycorrhizal fungi on decay rates of tree roots appear to be complex; for example, ectomycorrhizal fungi may depress fine root decay rates by limiting the activity of more effective saprotrophic decomposers ( Bödeker et al., 2016 ). Luo et al. (2017) observed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may influence fine root decay through interactions with actinobacterial decomposers. A global data analysis ( See et al., 2019 ) indicated higher decay rates for fine roots of arbuscular mycorrhizal trees than for ectomycorrhizal trees.",
          "Many studies of leaf litter decay indicate that macronutrients, N and P, are immobilized during the early stages of decomposition, reflecting high microbial demand ( McClaugherty et al., 1985 ). Immobilization of N and P has also been reported in root litter bag studies of fine root decomposition. However, studies using the intact core method have noted greater N and P release from decaying fine roots of forest trees than observed with litter bags ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ; Li et al., 2015 ). One possible mechanism that could contribute to this pattern is the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which were more abundant in decaying roots of red pine in cores than in litter bags ( Li et al., 2015 ). Lindahl and Tunlid (2015) suggested that the role of these fungi in litter decay was linked with acquisition of N and P.",
          "The primary objective of the present study was to compare fine root (<1 mm diameter) decay rates for seven species of temperate forest trees measured using the root litter bag and intact core methodologies. The measurements were made in a suite of 12 nominally monospecific plantations growing on a common site in central New York, USA ( Phillips and Fahey, 2006 ) and included four arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species and three ectomycorrhizal species. Building upon previous observations, we predicted that: 1) decay rate estimates would be consistently higher using the intact core than the litter bag method, and mobilization of N and P from decaying fine root litter would be greater for intact cores than for root litter bags ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ); 2) the fungal communities in the decaying roots would differ between the intact cores and root litterbags; we focused on fungi because of their known importance in acid forest soils; and 3) the root litter bag effect on mobilization of N and P in the plots containing ectomycorrhizal trees would be greater than in those containing arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, reflecting the hypothesized effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on this process ( Li et al., 2015 )."

              "The study was conducted in the Turkey Hill Plantations (THP) in Tompkins County, NY, USA (42°, 27′ N, 76°, 25′ W). From 1939 to 1941, Professor R.F. Chandler, Cornell University, established a series of tree plantations on a tract of abandoned farmland to study the effects of trees on soil properties. The entire tract was divided into one acre (0.4 ha) square plots and different tree species, or species combinations were assigned to the various plots. For several tree species two replicate plots were included, laid out in two blocks; although not specified in the notes from the original work, assignment of species to different plots was probably random (E. L. Stone, unpublished). Seedlings were planted at 1.5 × 1.5 m spacing. Variable survival, growth, and invasion by other species occurred during the ensuing 80 years, and some cultural treatment was conducted periodically to maintain the dominance of the planted species. The study area ranges in elevation from 430 to 450 m. Annual precipitation averages 890 mm with average air temperatures of −5.8 °C and 17.7 °C in January and June, respectively. Precipitation and temperature were near normal during the year of study (2020–2021; Fig. S1). Soils in the study area developed from silt-enriched glacial till derived primarily from local sandstones and siltstones. The soils at the THP are Aeric Fragiudepts (Mardin and Volusia series in Block 2) and Typic Dystrudepts (Lordstown series in Block 1), varying somewhat in drainage characteristics and depth to a fragipan layer. Detailed soil measurements for the plots are presented in Table 1 .",
              "For the present study, twelve nominally monospecific stands at the THP were utilized. For five species there were two replicate plots (sugar maple – SM, red maple-RM, red oak – RO, Norway spruce – NS, white pine – WP). For two additional species (tulip poplar – TP, black cherry – BC) there was a single plot located in Block 2. The proportional abundance in terms of basal area of the target species was measured for a 0.04 ha circular plot positioned to encompass the root sampling transects ( Table 1 )."

Fine roots (<1 mm diameter) were separated manually from larger roots the same day, and a subsample of rinsed fine roots from each plot was immediately frozen and stored at −20 °C for fungal amplicon sequencing. The remainder of the roots was air-dried, and a second subsample was collected for initial chemistry, moisture and ash content measurements. Initial moisture and was determined by drying to constant mass at 80 °C and then combusting for 4 h at 450 °C to measure ash-free dry weight (AFDW). About two-gram samples were weighed to 0.01 g, inserted in Nitex bags (hydrophilic nylon mesh, pore size = 100 μm), sealed, and labeled.

Twenty fine root biomass cores were collected using 5 cm diameter PVC cores, equally spaced about 1 m apart along two 10 m transects in each plot in late-October 2020. Cores were returned to the laboratory and immediately frozen at −20 °C until processing. Fine roots (<1 mm) were sorted by hand from each core. We intentionally included both live and dead fine roots during this root sorting; we reasoned that in the root decay cores at the time of collection (see below) it would not be possible to distinguish between roots that were originally alive vs dead, so that the difference in total root biomass would be most reliable. However, tiny fragments (<2 mm length) were ignored; in effect, we assumed that these mostly partially decayed root fragments would be completely decomposed after one year and hence not enter into the estimates.",
                  "Fine roots were rinsed free of adhering soil with tap water over a 53 μm sieve and dried to constant mass at 80 °C. Dry weight was measured to ±l mg. A pooled subsample of dried roots from each plot was finely ground. Subsamples were combusted at 450 °C for 4 h and re-weighed to estimate AFDW. Lignin and nutrient contents were measured on a separate subsample (see below).",
                  "In situ decomposition was measured by driving a 5 cm diameter soil PVC core to 20 cm depth, thereby severing all the roots and initiating the decay process. The PVC cores were prepared with holes of 25 cm 2 drilled in the walls, and the holes were covered with Nitex cloth to prohibit colonization by roots but not soil microorganisms. Fifteen of these cores were deployed on transects in each plot parallel to the initial fine root biomass cores. These cores were installed in late October 2020 and collected one year later. Root decay cores were returned to the laboratory and immediately frozen at −20 °C until processing.",
                  "Fine roots were sorted by hand from root decay cores, using a different procedure than that for the fine root biomass cores to maximize recovery of tiny root fragments. First, each sample was gently spread on a tray and all the easily sorted roots were removed manually and stored in glass jars; this step usually took <0.5 h per sample. At this point a small subsample was taken, rinsed with tap water and stored at −20 °C for fungal amplicon sequencing. Next, each entire remaining soil sample was sieved through a 4 mm sieve. Fine roots were sorted from the fraction retained on the sieve and added to the larger sample jars. The fine fraction that passed through the sieve was stored at 4 °C until final processing. Each of the fifteen, fine fraction (sieved soil) samples from each plot were pooled, thoroughly mixed, and spread on a large tray. Using a pie subsampling approach two subsamples (ca. 8 % each) from each plot were collected for fine fragment sorting. Fine root fragments (mostly <5 mm in length) were carefully sorted by hand from these subsamples. (Note: this step required about 1 h per subsample; thus, we estimate that complete processing of all the individual root decay cores for fine fragments would require about 250 h). The mass of the two subsamples from each sample was similar (mean difference = 24.3 %). The fine fragments were dried to constant mass, weighed to ±1 mg and combusted at 450 °C to determine AFDW. The AFDW of each sample was estimated by adding the mean fine fragment mass to the individual sample AFDW values. Fine fragments comprised on average 19.6 % of total sample AFDW across all the plots; thus, ignoring these tiny fragments would result in a substantial overestimation of decay rates.",

Acid detergent lignin ( Van Soest, 1973 ) was determined on an ANKOM fiber analyzer (ANKOM Technology, Macedon, NY, USA). Total N was analyzed by combustion on an automated CN analyzer, and total P was analyzed spectrophotometrically following dry ashing and acid dissolution ( Thomas et al., 1967 )."

This approach was necessary because the individual decayed root cores could not be paired with live root biomass measurements. The effect of tree species on decay rate measured by the root litter bag method was evaluated using a mixed model with random effects of Plot nested within Block. Differences in decay rate between tree species with AM vs ECM associations were evaluated with a mixed model with mycorrhizal type and method (cores/bags) fixed and with Plot as a random effect. The correlations between root decay rate and initial root tissue chemistry (lignin:N ratio) for each of the two methods were evaluated based on Pearson correlation coefficients. Finally, we performed a distance-based redundancy analysis of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of the fungal community with sample decay rate, N remaining, and P remaining using the capscale function in the vegan package in R ( Oksanen et al., 2017 )."

For the five species with replicate plots, the measured decay rates were not significantly different between plots; however, for red maple and especially Norway spruce based on the in situ core method, obvious differences between the replicate plots were observed ( Fig. 1 ).

Note that soil classification at the THP site indicated different soil types in every case for the replicate plot pairs ( Table 1 ).",
              "The overall fungal composition differed markedly between the living roots and decayed roots; a key exception was the high abundance of Mycena spp. in most samples of both types ( Fig. 4 ). Note that Mycena also was observed at moderate or high abundance in nearly all samples of the living roots, the only exceptions being black cherry and red oak plot 2 ( Fig. 4 ). The highest abundance of Mycena was usually seen in the in-situ core samples; overall, Mycena was nearly twice as abundant in the in-situ cores (37.5 %) than the root litter bags (21.7 %), the notable exception being white pine plot 2 ( Fig. 4 ). Although five different species of Mycena were detected, most of the reads were for M. abramsii , except in the white pine plots where M. sanguinolenta was dominant. Other common and abundant fungal taxa in the decaying fine roots included members of the Agaricomycetes and Helotiales as well as Russula (in pine and oak), Burgoa (tulip poplar), and Phialocephala fortinii (several tree species).",
              "Based on the redundancy analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in the fungal communities, variation in the fine root decay rate in the root litter bags and intact cores was not significantly dependent on fungal community composition ( p = 0.775). In contrast, N release from the decaying roots was strongly dependent on the fungal community composition ( p = 0.003), while P release was marginally dependent ( p = 0.067).",
              "As noted above, the one exception to faster fine root decay for in situ cores than root litter bags was Norway spruce, which decayed very rapidly in the bags in both replicate plots ( Fig. 1 ), despite the high lignin concentration and lignin:N ratio in the root tissue ( Table 1 ). The fungal community in these samples was dominated by ASVs in the Agaricomycetes that are undescribed and uncultured."

          "Measurement of the decomposition of fine roots is challenging because of the difficulty of quantifying the process without disturbing the soil environment. In most studies fine roots have been excised from soil before being enclosed in fine mesh bags and incubated in soil, the root litter bag approach; however, this method may introduce important artifacts that could cause measurement error or bias ( Li et al., 2022 ). An alternative approach to measurement of fine root decomposition was developed, the intact core method, in which fine roots incubate inside soil cores where the roots have died because of being cut off during installation of the core ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ). This method preserves the rhizosphere with its microbial community and, at least, those invertebrates that occupied the core prior to installation. All the direct comparisons of tree fine root decay between the root litter bag and intact core method have demonstrated considerably higher decay rates with the latter method, ranging from about 23 % to nearly twice as rapid ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ; Li et al., 2015 Luo et al., 2017 ; Sun et al., 2013 ). Coincidentally, mobilization of macronutrients, N and P, from decaying fine roots has been shown in these studies to be much greater for intact cores than for root litter bags in which nutrient immobilization typically occurs, as commonly observed for decaying leaf litter ( McClaugherty et al., 1985 ). Li et al. (2015) suggested that differences in the microbial decomposer community between intact cores and root litter bags, including ectomycorrhizal fungi, might contribute to differences in decay rate and nutrient mobilization.",
          "We measured decomposition and nutrient mobilization of fine roots of seven tree species growing in monospecific plantations at a common site in central New York, USA, comparing the root litter bag and intact core methods. We predicted that both decay rate and nutrient mobility would be consistently much greater for fine roots decaying in situ than for those in litter bags. Although we observed significantly higher dry weight and nutrient loss for fine roots in intact cores than litter bags, the differences in decay rate were smaller (12 % on a relative basis) than noted in other comparative studies ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ; Li et al., 2015 ; Sun et al., 2013 ), and they were not consistent across all species; in particular, Norway spruce fine roots decayed very rapidly in litter bags, faster than for intact cores ( Fig. 1 ). Similarly, although significantly higher N and P loss were observed for intact cores than litter bags across all the plots ( Figs. 2, 3 ), this result was not entirely consistent, with the opposite being observed for one plot each of Norway spruce and red oak. Thus, our first prediction was not supported. We also expected that differences in decay rate and nutrient mobilization for the two methods would be greater for ectomycorrhizal than arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, supporting the involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the decomposition and nutrient mobilization process ( Li et al., 2015 ). We also found no support for this hypothesis as consistent differences related to mycorrhizal type were not observed. For the intact core method, generally higher decay rates were observed for fine roots of arbuscular than ectomycorrhizal trees supporting the global analysis of See et al. (2019) ; however, this pattern was not statistically significant because of the high decay rate for Norway spruce in the root litter bag method.",
          "Finally, we hypothesized that differences in fungal communities between the two methods would contribute to differences in decay rates and method effects. Although the fungal communities in the fine roots were sometimes very different between the two methods for a particular plot, the role of these differences in explaining decay rate differences was not conclusive, as indicated by the redundancy analysis. This observation supports the existence of functional redundancy in tree root decomposition as recently noted for Scots pine and drought ( Herzog et al., 2019 ). Also, the likely role of bacteria ( Luo et al., 2017 ) and soil fauna ( Bokhorst and Wardle, 2013 ) in fine root decay should be acknowledged. Certainly, the ubiquity and abundance of Mycena spp. in the decaying roots was indicative of its key role in fine root decay; however, Mycena was usually abundant in both intact cores and root litter bags ( Fig. 4 ). In contrast to observations of Li et al. (2015) , ectomycorrhizal fungi were not very abundant in either the root litter bags or the intact cores, and there was only limited support for the hypothesized role of particular ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient mobilization ( Li et al., 2015 ). The one case in which a confirmed ectomycorrhizal fungus was more abundant in decayed than live roots was for Russula in white pine in the intact cores ( Fig. 4 ), and these roots also had among the highest release of N and P among all the samples.",
          "Why was the difference in fine root decay rates measured using the intact core vs the root litter bag method smaller than has been noted in other such comparisons for temperate forest trees? Certainly, there were methodological, species and site differences among the studies that could have contributed. However, the most likely explanation is the exhaustive effort expended in the present study to recover essentially all the tiniest (mostly <2 mm) fine root fragments (see Methods ). Because these fragments would be retained by the fine mesh used in root litter bags (50–100 um), they would contribute to the dry weight remaining. We can attest that the amount of fine root fragments not recovered in the present study was insignificant. The mass of these tiny fragments comprised an average of 9.3 % of the AFDW of the remaining sample. Thus, limited recovery of fine fragments might account for the larger discrepancy in decay rates between the two methods in some previous studies that did not report such efforts at fragment recovery. However, at least one study that indicated faster decay for fine roots in intact cores than litter bags ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ) made an exhaustive effort to recover tiny root fragments. Also, we ignored tiny root fragments (<2 mm length) in the pre-incubation cores on the assumption that these mostly dead root fragments would be completely decayed after one year; to the extent that some of these fragments remained, our intact core method would slightly underestimate decay rate.",
          "Fine root decay rate values were remarkably similar between the two plots for each of the five species with replicate plots (Table S1) despite differences in soil types and fungal community composition between the pairs. Although all the soils at the site are broadly classified as acidic Inceptisols, the Lordstown soils in Block 1 (Typic Dystrudepts) are well drained whereas in the Mardin and Volusia soils in Block 2 (Aeric Fragiudepts) a fragipan at 20–30 cm depth restricts drainage. Nevertheless, no clear effects of these soil differences on decay rates were evident; average decay rates across species and methods were similar for the two soil types.",
          "The obvious importance of Mycena spp. in fine root decay at this site, based on the high proportion of ITS2 reads in the decaying roots for most of the plots and species ( Fig. 4 ), invites some evaluation and speculation. First, Mycena spp. were common in the living fine roots of all the species except black cherry. Mycena is a very common genus of saprotrophic fungi in forest soils ( Boberg et al., 2011 ), and recent evidence indicates that many Mycena spp. can form endophytic associations with tree roots, even including apparent mutualistic interactions ( Thoen et al., 2020 ). Moreover, in some situations Mycena spp. can comprise a high proportion of all the fungal reads in living plant roots ( Harder et al., 2023 ); this matches our observations for four tree species: sugar maple, red maple, red oak, and white pine. Kohout et al. (2018) detected Mycena in living roots of Norway spruce, and following forest clearcutting, Mycena increased greatly in abundance as the roots decomposed. We often observed an overall increase in the relative abundance of Mycena in decaying roots, especially for the intact cores ( Fig. 4 ). These observations raise the interesting possibility that the endophyte status of Mycena may constitute a strategy to gain priority in fine root decomposition, analogous to that noted for wood decay fungi ( Hiscox et al., 2015 ).",
          "Note that the prominent exception to the pattern of higher decay in the intact cores than the litter bags was Norway spruce for which unexpectedly rapid decay was observed in the litter bags ( Fig. 1 ). We note that Norway spruce was the only non-native tree species in the present study. Unidentified and uncultured fungal taxa from the Agaricomycetes were uniquely abundant in the spruce root litter bags, and these may have been very rapid decomposers of the spruce fine roots. The fungal community in the present study had some overlap with the aforementioned study of fungal communities of decaying roots in a clearcut Norway spruce plantation in Czech Republic ( Kohout et al., 2018 ), especially Mycena , Philocephala and some ectomycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Cenococcum , Amanita , Tomentella ).",
          "Other approaches for estimating fine root decay have been explored, for example, direct observations of root disappearance using minirhizotrons; again, much faster decay has been demonstrated with this approach ( Hendrick and Pregitzer, 1996 ; Song et al., 2008 ) than observations for root litter bags, but artifacts associated with minirhizotron tube effects are possible. Li et al. (2020, 2022) devised an indirect approach for estimating fine root decay rates that reduces some of these weaknesses. Their method is labor intensive combining sequential root coring and minirhizotron observations. Perhaps the most important problem with their method is the difficulty of objectively determining root mortality and identifying and sorting dead roots (i.e., root tissues often die gradually, and dead roots are gradually transformed into coarse particulate organic matter), and the interrelated problem of fine root herbivory which can be substantial ( Gan and Wickings, 2020 ; Stevens and Jones, 2006 ). The approach of Li et al. (2020) would seem to be capable of providing improved estimates of fine root decay rates, especially if the issue of dead vs live roots can be circumvented, and more comparisons with the relatively simple and inexpensive root litter bag approach would be useful. Li et al. (2022) reported about two times higher decay rates by their indirect approach compared with root litter bags in a loblolly pine forest. We also note that the duration of most root decay studies has usually been only one year; problems with root tissue recovery from intact cores precludes longer incubation times. Whether the initial differences in decay rates between methods remain consistent through longer time frames will be challenging to test.",
          "In conclusion, the intact core method generally indicated a higher decay rate and nutrient mobilization than the root litter bag method, though the differences were not as large as previously reported. Moreover, the differences in decay rates between the two methods did not correlate consistently with differences in the fungal community. These observations suggest that the less expensive root litter bag method might be only slightly biased towards lower decay rates and can be applied more confidently to evaluate experimental treatment effects on fine root decomposition. Now that we have characterized the fungal communities and identified the potentially important players in root decomposition at this site, it would be useful for future studies to employ methods such as qPCR to assess absolute abundances of these fungal taxa in relation to root decay. Certainly, the results highlight the complexity of quantifying fine root decay and nutrient mobilization and suggest that more research is needed to determine the microbial drivers of root decomposition among tree species."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Forest ecosystems store a large amount of Earth's terrestrial carbon (about 860 Pg; Pan et al., 2011 ). Forest soils comprise a high proportion of this forest carbon (about 380 Pg or 44 %), representing nearly 17 % of the total global C stock in terrestrial ecosystems ( Pan et al., 2013 ; Scharlemann et al., 2014 ). The three principal inputs of carbon to forest soils include aboveground detritus, belowground detritus (root mortality), and rhizosphere carbon flux. Although fine roots represent only a small proportion of the total biomass in forests, their short lifespans and rapid turnover result in a large proportion of the carbon input to the soil ( Jackson et al., 1996 ); for example, root inputs to relatively stable soil organic C stocks have been estimated to be five times greater than for aboveground detritus ( Jackson et al., 2017 ). Thus, understanding the process of decomposition of forest roots is important for evaluating global carbon dynamics. However, due to methodological challenges, the rates and controls of fine root decomposition are still uncertain. Depending upon the decay rates assumed, the contribution of fine roots to soil carbon stocks could vary considerably ( Clemmensen et al., 2013 ). The traditional litter bag is the most common method for measuring the decomposition rate of fine roots; the approach is widely used for aboveground detritus ( Karberg et al., 2008 ). Fine roots are excised from soil, prepared (e.g., air dried), and returned to the soil to incubate within fine mesh bags (e.g., 50–100 um mesh), which prevent the loss of small fragments or entry of soil particles, both of which would confound the estimation of weight loss. This method offers a simple, low-cost approach for estimating fine root decomposition rates, especially for assessing treatment effects and species differences in decomposition ( Freschet et al., 2021 ); however, this method may introduce important artifacts that could cause measurement error or bias. Early studies using this method indicated unexpectedly slow decay for both temperate conifer and broadleaf deciduous tree roots ( Fogel and Hunt, 1979 ; McClaugherty et al., 1984 ). McClaugherty et al. (1984) noted likely artifacts resulting from the root litter bag method, especially the condition of the root samples at the initiation of studies and the composition of decomposer communities. For example, the composition of both the microbial and faunal community of decomposers may be considerably different from those of roots senescing naturally and decaying within their intact rhizosphere ( Li et al., 2010 ; Li et al., 2015 ; Luo et al., 2017 Freschet et al., 2021 ). An alternative approach to the root litter bag method is the intact core method in which loss of mass and chemical changes are estimated for dead roots contained in soil cores ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ). This method is labor intensive, requiring accurate and precise measurements of fine root biomass at the stand level. The method is suitable for measuring individual species decay rates only for monospecific or plantation forests. However, the limitation for the litter bag method that the fine roots decay in the absence of their rhizosphere has been posited to justify the higher expense of the intact core method ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ). Indeed, direct comparisons of decay rates of fine roots of forest trees using these two approaches have consistently reported significantly higher decay rates for the intact core method than the root litterbag method ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ; Sun et al., 2013 ; Li et al., 2015 ; Luo et al., 2017 ; Freschet et al., 2021 ). A myriad of environmental and biotic factors affects the decay rates of fine roots in forests. Similar to leaf litter, temperature, moisture and substrate quality are undoubtedly important controlling factors ( Silver and Miya, 2001 ; See et al., 2019 ). In general, fine root litter usually exhibits lower decay rates than leaf litter of the same species, a difference that appears to be associated in part with substrate quality and secondary chemistry ( Sun et al., 2018 ; Guo et al., 2021 ). The role of root size or order is not fully understood; for example, some but not all studies indicate higher decay rates for order 3–4 than order 1–2 fine roots ( Goebel et al., 2011 ; Wang et al., 2019 ), possibly reflecting subtle differences in substrate chemistry ( Beidler and Pritchard, 2017 ). The relative roles of different microbial and faunal groups in fine root decay are not well understood. Recent surveys using molecular techniques have quantified the complex microbial communities colonizing decaying fine roots ( Herzog et al., 2019 ) and the succession of bacterial and fungal decomposers ( Kohout et al., 2018 ). Among the latter are endophytes, saprotrophs as well as mycorrhizal fungi. The effects of mycorrhizal fungi on decay rates of tree roots appear to be complex; for example, ectomycorrhizal fungi may depress fine root decay rates by limiting the activity of more effective saprotrophic decomposers ( Bödeker et al., 2016 ). Luo et al. (2017) observed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may influence fine root decay through interactions with actinobacterial decomposers. A global data analysis ( See et al., 2019 ) indicated higher decay rates for fine roots of arbuscular mycorrhizal trees than for ectomycorrhizal trees. Many studies of leaf litter decay indicate that macronutrients, N and P, are immobilized during the early stages of decomposition, reflecting high microbial demand ( McClaugherty et al., 1985 ). Immobilization of N and P has also been reported in root litter bag studies of fine root decomposition. However, studies using the intact core method have noted greater N and P release from decaying fine roots of forest trees than observed with litter bags ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ; Li et al., 2015 ). One possible mechanism that could contribute to this pattern is the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which were more abundant in decaying roots of red pine in cores than in litter bags ( Li et al., 2015 ). Lindahl and Tunlid (2015) suggested that the role of these fungi in litter decay was linked with acquisition of N and P. The primary objective of the present study was to compare fine root (<1 mm diameter) decay rates for seven species of temperate forest trees measured using the root litter bag and intact core methodologies. The measurements were made in a suite of 12 nominally monospecific plantations growing on a common site in central New York, USA ( Phillips and Fahey, 2006 ) and included four arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species and three ectomycorrhizal species. Building upon previous observations, we predicted that: 1) decay rate estimates would be consistently higher using the intact core than the litter bag method, and mobilization of N and P from decaying fine root litter would be greater for intact cores than for root litter bags ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ); 2) the fungal communities in the decaying roots would differ between the intact cores and root litterbags; we focused on fungi because of their known importance in acid forest soils; and 3) the root litter bag effect on mobilization of N and P in the plots containing ectomycorrhizal trees would be greater than in those containing arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, reflecting the hypothesized effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on this process ( Li et al., 2015 ). 2 Methods 2.1 Study area The study was conducted in the Turkey Hill Plantations (THP) in Tompkins County, NY, USA (42°, 27′ N, 76°, 25′ W). From 1939 to 1941, Professor R.F. Chandler, Cornell University, established a series of tree plantations on a tract of abandoned farmland to study the effects of trees on soil properties. The entire tract was divided into one acre (0.4 ha) square plots and different tree species, or species combinations were assigned to the various plots. For several tree species two replicate plots were included, laid out in two blocks; although not specified in the notes from the original work, assignment of species to different plots was probably random (E. L. Stone, unpublished). Seedlings were planted at 1.5 × 1.5 m spacing. Variable survival, growth, and invasion by other species occurred during the ensuing 80 years, and some cultural treatment was conducted periodically to maintain the dominance of the planted species. The study area ranges in elevation from 430 to 450 m. Annual precipitation averages 890 mm with average air temperatures of −5.8 °C and 17.7 °C in January and June, respectively. Precipitation and temperature were near normal during the year of study (2020–2021; Fig. S1). Soils in the study area developed from silt-enriched glacial till derived primarily from local sandstones and siltstones. The soils at the THP are Aeric Fragiudepts (Mardin and Volusia series in Block 2) and Typic Dystrudepts (Lordstown series in Block 1), varying somewhat in drainage characteristics and depth to a fragipan layer. Detailed soil measurements for the plots are presented in Table 1 . For the present study, twelve nominally monospecific stands at the THP were utilized. For five species there were two replicate plots (sugar maple – SM, red maple-RM, red oak – RO, Norway spruce – NS, white pine – WP). For two additional species (tulip poplar – TP, black cherry – BC) there was a single plot located in Block 2. The proportional abundance in terms of basal area of the target species was measured for a 0.04 ha circular plot positioned to encompass the root sampling transects ( Table 1 ). 2.2 Approaches Fine root decomposition was measured over one year (late October 2020–2021) using two approaches: 1) buried fine root litter bags and 2) in situ fine root weight loss for roots in soil cores. 2.2.1 Root litter bags Roots were excavated in each plantation from 0 to 20 cm depth using shovels. Roots were hand sorted from several soil samples, returned to the laboratory, and cleaned of adhering soil under a stream of tap water. Fine roots (<1 mm diameter) were separated manually from larger roots the same day, and a subsample of rinsed fine roots from each plot was immediately frozen and stored at −20 °C for fungal amplicon sequencing. The remainder of the roots was air-dried, and a second subsample was collected for initial chemistry, moisture and ash content measurements. Initial moisture and was determined by drying to constant mass at 80 °C and then combusting for 4 h at 450 °C to measure ash-free dry weight (AFDW). About two-gram samples were weighed to 0.01 g, inserted in Nitex bags (hydrophilic nylon mesh, pore size = 100 μm), sealed, and labeled. On 22 October 2020, six of the fine root litter bags of the target species were inserted to about 5 cm depth in each plot equally spaced 1 m apart along transects. One year later the bags were retrieved from the field and returned to the laboratory for processing. Roots were removed from the bags and subsamples were removed and rinsed for fungal amplicon sequencing (immediately frozen) and for final moisture, ash, and chemistry determinations. The remainder of the sample was dried to constant mass at 80 °C. Final AFDW was determined with corrections based on the subsamples. 2.2.2 Intact cores Fine root decomposition also was measured in each plot based on the difference in AFDW between initial root coring and soil cores in which all roots were severed and then incubated in place for one year in the field ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ). Twenty fine root biomass cores were collected using 5 cm diameter PVC cores, equally spaced about 1 m apart along two 10 m transects in each plot in late-October 2020. Cores were returned to the laboratory and immediately frozen at −20 °C until processing. Fine roots (<1 mm) were sorted by hand from each core. We intentionally included both live and dead fine roots during this root sorting; we reasoned that in the root decay cores at the time of collection (see below) it would not be possible to distinguish between roots that were originally alive vs dead, so that the difference in total root biomass would be most reliable. However, tiny fragments (<2 mm length) were ignored; in effect, we assumed that these mostly partially decayed root fragments would be completely decomposed after one year and hence not enter into the estimates. Fine roots were rinsed free of adhering soil with tap water over a 53 μm sieve and dried to constant mass at 80 °C. Dry weight was measured to ±l mg. A pooled subsample of dried roots from each plot was finely ground. Subsamples were combusted at 450 °C for 4 h and re-weighed to estimate AFDW. Lignin and nutrient contents were measured on a separate subsample (see below). In situ decomposition was measured by driving a 5 cm diameter soil PVC core to 20 cm depth, thereby severing all the roots and initiating the decay process. The PVC cores were prepared with holes of 25 cm 2 drilled in the walls, and the holes were covered with Nitex cloth to prohibit colonization by roots but not soil microorganisms. Fifteen of these cores were deployed on transects in each plot parallel to the initial fine root biomass cores. These cores were installed in late October 2020 and collected one year later. Root decay cores were returned to the laboratory and immediately frozen at −20 °C until processing. Fine roots were sorted by hand from root decay cores, using a different procedure than that for the fine root biomass cores to maximize recovery of tiny root fragments. First, each sample was gently spread on a tray and all the easily sorted roots were removed manually and stored in glass jars; this step usually took <0.5 h per sample. At this point a small subsample was taken, rinsed with tap water and stored at −20 °C for fungal amplicon sequencing. Next, each entire remaining soil sample was sieved through a 4 mm sieve. Fine roots were sorted from the fraction retained on the sieve and added to the larger sample jars. The fine fraction that passed through the sieve was stored at 4 °C until final processing. Each of the fifteen, fine fraction (sieved soil) samples from each plot were pooled, thoroughly mixed, and spread on a large tray. Using a pie subsampling approach two subsamples (ca. 8 % each) from each plot were collected for fine fragment sorting. Fine root fragments (mostly <5 mm in length) were carefully sorted by hand from these subsamples. (Note: this step required about 1 h per subsample; thus, we estimate that complete processing of all the individual root decay cores for fine fragments would require about 250 h). The mass of the two subsamples from each sample was similar (mean difference = 24.3 %). The fine fragments were dried to constant mass, weighed to ±1 mg and combusted at 450 °C to determine AFDW. The AFDW of each sample was estimated by adding the mean fine fragment mass to the individual sample AFDW values. Fine fragments comprised on average 19.6 % of total sample AFDW across all the plots; thus, ignoring these tiny fragments would result in a substantial overestimation of decay rates. Chemical analysis of subsamples of initial samples and final pooled subsamples from root litter bags and root decay cores were analyzed for lignin, N, and P concentrations at DairyOne laboratories, Ithaca, NY. Acid detergent lignin ( Van Soest, 1973 ) was determined on an ANKOM fiber analyzer (ANKOM Technology, Macedon, NY, USA). Total N was analyzed by combustion on an automated CN analyzer, and total P was analyzed spectrophotometrically following dry ashing and acid dissolution ( Thomas et al., 1967 ). 2.2.3 Fungal sequencing Roots were surface sterilized in 70 % ethanol for 30 s and rinsed with DI water. DNA was extracted from each root sample (100 mg) using DNeasy Plant Mini kit and subsequently cleaned with Qiagen DNeasy PowerClean Pro kit to remove potential polymerase chain reactions (PCR) inhibitors (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA). For each sample, the fungal ITS2 gene was amplified using the primers 5.8S-FUN/ITS4-FUN modified for the Illumina platform by fusing CS1 and CS2 linker primers for forward and reverse primers, respectively. PCR was conducted with duplicate 25 μL assays composed of 12.5 μL of KAPA HiFi Master Mix, 0.75 μL of each primer (10 μM), 8.5 μL of PCR-grade water, and 2.5 μL of a genomic DNA template (∼10 ng μL −1 ) for each sample. The following thermal profile was used: initial denaturation and enzyme activation step of 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s, with a final extension of 72 °C for 1 min. Qualities of the PCR products were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Duplicate amplicon samples were combined. Additional rounds of PCR were performed to fuse CS1/CS2 linker primers to the indices and adapters (an initial denaturation and enzyme activation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 15 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min) before Illumina MiSeq PE250 sequencing at Génome Québec (Montréal, Québec, Canada). The Illumina sequences were deposited at NCBI (Bioproject accession number PRJNA1023529) Illumina adapters and primer complements were trimmed using ‘cutadapt’ ( Martin, 2011 ). Illumina sequences were then processed with the DADA2 pipeline to remove low quality reads, filter chimeras, and to resolve amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) ( Callahan et al., 2017 ; Pauvert et al., 2019 ). Taxonomy was assigned to each ASV against the UNITE database ( Kojalg et al., 2013 ), and these are presented at the lowest taxonomic level provided by the database. Sequences that were not identified as fungi at the kingdom level were removed for downstream analyses leaving a total of 2150 ASVs. For analysis of fungal richness, samples were rarefied to an even depth of 2527 sequences per sample. We assigned functional guilds to the fungal sequences based on the FUNGuild database ( Nguyen et al., 2016 ). 2.3 Statistical analysis Significant differences in fine root decay rate and N and P release between the two methods across all 12 plots were evaluated using paired sample t -tests. We estimated standard deviations for the intact core method with a bootstrapping approach: values were chosen at random 1000 times from the distributions for initial and final root biomass for each plot, and the differences between initial and final biomass for each permutation were calculated. This approach was necessary because the individual decayed root cores could not be paired with live root biomass measurements. The effect of tree species on decay rate measured by the root litter bag method was evaluated using a mixed model with random effects of Plot nested within Block. Differences in decay rate between tree species with AM vs ECM associations were evaluated with a mixed model with mycorrhizal type and method (cores/bags) fixed and with Plot as a random effect. The correlations between root decay rate and initial root tissue chemistry (lignin:N ratio) for each of the two methods were evaluated based on Pearson correlation coefficients. Finally, we performed a distance-based redundancy analysis of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of the fungal community with sample decay rate, N remaining, and P remaining using the capscale function in the vegan package in R ( Oksanen et al., 2017 ). 3 Results 3.1 Mass loss Across all 12 plots, the average AFDW remaining for fine roots decaying in buried root litter bags for one year was 71.8 ± 2.7 %. Weight loss based on in situ decay cores was significantly greater ( p = 0.040) with an average AFDW remaining of 63.2 ± 3.2 %. Decay rate was greater in cores than in litter bags for most species ( Fig. 1 ); among the individual plots, based on non-overlap of 95 % confidence intervals, differences between the methods were significant for the following plots: BC, SM1, SM2, RM1, and WP1. The notable exception was NS1 which exhibited significantly faster decay in litter bags. Decay rates for tulip poplar and for NS2 were essentially the same for the two methods ( Fig. 1 ). Fine root decay rates in the litter bags differed significantly among species (species effect in mixed model, F = 32.08, p = 0.0022), but the order of decay differed between the two methods. For both methods tulip poplar had fast decay, whereas the slowest decay occurred for red oak. Among the other species, differences between the two methods were similar with the striking exception of Norway spruce, as noted above. Therefore, the order of root decay rates based on litter bags was: TP=NS > BC=SM = RM = WP = RO; whereas, for cores (qualitatively): BC > TP > SM = RM = WP > NS > RO (Table S1). Although slower fine root decay rates were observed in the intact cores for ectomycorrhizal trees (NS, WP, RO) than for arbuscular mycorrhizal trees (SM, RM, TP, BC), because of the notable exception of Norway spruce in the root litter bags ( Fig. 1 ), the overall differences were not statistically significant ( p = 0.168). For the five species with replicate plots, the measured decay rates were not significantly different between plots; however, for red maple and especially Norway spruce based on the in situ core method, obvious differences between the replicate plots were observed ( Fig. 1 ). Variation across plots in dry weight loss based on root litter bags was strongly dependent upon initial lignin:N ratio (Pearson r = 0.68); in contrast, this relationship was weak for the intact core method ( r = 0.21). 3.2 Nutrient contents Concentrations of N in the fine roots decaying in root litter bags increased after one year except for red oak for which N concentration declined. In contrast, N concentrations remained nearly constant for root detritus in root decay cores (initial = 1.21 %, final = 1.17 %). Thus, N immobilization was significantly greater in the litter bags, with 77.5 ± 2.2 % remaining after one year vs. 60.4 ± 1.7 % for in situ cores ( Fig. 2 ). Again, the exception was red oak for which similar N retention was observed for the two methods in both replicate plots (68–69 %). An analogous pattern was observed for P ( Fig. 3 ), with 72.8 % remaining for litter bags and 53.3 % for in situ cores. Mobilization of N and P from decaying roots was not clearly related to mycorrhizal type. 3.3 Fungal communities A diverse and highly variable fungal community was observed in living and decaying fine roots of seven tree species growing in twelve plots at THP in central New York. The mean ASV richness was quite similar in the various fine root samples: living roots (79.7/sample), one-year decayed roots in litter bags (87.1/sample) and decayed roots in cores (92.2/sample). For the species with replicate plots no significant or consistent differences in fungal diversity were detected in the decaying roots of the five species ( p = 0.840). The composition of fungal communities in the fine roots exhibited some expected patterns as a function of mycorrhizal type. For example, confirmed ectomycorrhizal fungi were much more abundant in the roots of ectomycorrhizal tree species (pine, spruce and oak) than AM species (maples, cherry, tulip poplar; 15.8 % vs 1.1 %), whereas fungi from the Glomeraceae were much more abundant in the roots of trees that form AM. Among the five species with replicate plots, white pine, red oak and sugar maple exhibited similar fungal composition in living roots in the two replicate plots whereas for red maple and Norway spruce the fungal communities were quite different between the replicate plots (Fig. S2). Note that soil classification at the THP site indicated different soil types in every case for the replicate plot pairs ( Table 1 ). The overall fungal composition differed markedly between the living roots and decayed roots; a key exception was the high abundance of Mycena spp. in most samples of both types ( Fig. 4 ). Note that Mycena also was observed at moderate or high abundance in nearly all samples of the living roots, the only exceptions being black cherry and red oak plot 2 ( Fig. 4 ). The highest abundance of Mycena was usually seen in the in-situ core samples; overall, Mycena was nearly twice as abundant in the in-situ cores (37.5 %) than the root litter bags (21.7 %), the notable exception being white pine plot 2 ( Fig. 4 ). Although five different species of Mycena were detected, most of the reads were for M. abramsii , except in the white pine plots where M. sanguinolenta was dominant. Other common and abundant fungal taxa in the decaying fine roots included members of the Agaricomycetes and Helotiales as well as Russula (in pine and oak), Burgoa (tulip poplar), and Phialocephala fortinii (several tree species). Based on the redundancy analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in the fungal communities, variation in the fine root decay rate in the root litter bags and intact cores was not significantly dependent on fungal community composition ( p = 0.775). In contrast, N release from the decaying roots was strongly dependent on the fungal community composition ( p = 0.003), while P release was marginally dependent ( p = 0.067). As noted above, the one exception to faster fine root decay for in situ cores than root litter bags was Norway spruce, which decayed very rapidly in the bags in both replicate plots ( Fig. 1 ), despite the high lignin concentration and lignin:N ratio in the root tissue ( Table 1 ). The fungal community in these samples was dominated by ASVs in the Agaricomycetes that are undescribed and uncultured. 4 Discussion Measurement of the decomposition of fine roots is challenging because of the difficulty of quantifying the process without disturbing the soil environment. In most studies fine roots have been excised from soil before being enclosed in fine mesh bags and incubated in soil, the root litter bag approach; however, this method may introduce important artifacts that could cause measurement error or bias ( Li et al., 2022 ). An alternative approach to measurement of fine root decomposition was developed, the intact core method, in which fine roots incubate inside soil cores where the roots have died because of being cut off during installation of the core ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ). This method preserves the rhizosphere with its microbial community and, at least, those invertebrates that occupied the core prior to installation. All the direct comparisons of tree fine root decay between the root litter bag and intact core method have demonstrated considerably higher decay rates with the latter method, ranging from about 23 % to nearly twice as rapid ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ; Li et al., 2015 Luo et al., 2017 ; Sun et al., 2013 ). Coincidentally, mobilization of macronutrients, N and P, from decaying fine roots has been shown in these studies to be much greater for intact cores than for root litter bags in which nutrient immobilization typically occurs, as commonly observed for decaying leaf litter ( McClaugherty et al., 1985 ). Li et al. (2015) suggested that differences in the microbial decomposer community between intact cores and root litter bags, including ectomycorrhizal fungi, might contribute to differences in decay rate and nutrient mobilization. We measured decomposition and nutrient mobilization of fine roots of seven tree species growing in monospecific plantations at a common site in central New York, USA, comparing the root litter bag and intact core methods. We predicted that both decay rate and nutrient mobility would be consistently much greater for fine roots decaying in situ than for those in litter bags. Although we observed significantly higher dry weight and nutrient loss for fine roots in intact cores than litter bags, the differences in decay rate were smaller (12 % on a relative basis) than noted in other comparative studies ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ; Li et al., 2015 ; Sun et al., 2013 ), and they were not consistent across all species; in particular, Norway spruce fine roots decayed very rapidly in litter bags, faster than for intact cores ( Fig. 1 ). Similarly, although significantly higher N and P loss were observed for intact cores than litter bags across all the plots ( Figs. 2, 3 ), this result was not entirely consistent, with the opposite being observed for one plot each of Norway spruce and red oak. Thus, our first prediction was not supported. We also expected that differences in decay rate and nutrient mobilization for the two methods would be greater for ectomycorrhizal than arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, supporting the involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the decomposition and nutrient mobilization process ( Li et al., 2015 ). We also found no support for this hypothesis as consistent differences related to mycorrhizal type were not observed. For the intact core method, generally higher decay rates were observed for fine roots of arbuscular than ectomycorrhizal trees supporting the global analysis of See et al. (2019) ; however, this pattern was not statistically significant because of the high decay rate for Norway spruce in the root litter bag method. Finally, we hypothesized that differences in fungal communities between the two methods would contribute to differences in decay rates and method effects. Although the fungal communities in the fine roots were sometimes very different between the two methods for a particular plot, the role of these differences in explaining decay rate differences was not conclusive, as indicated by the redundancy analysis. This observation supports the existence of functional redundancy in tree root decomposition as recently noted for Scots pine and drought ( Herzog et al., 2019 ). Also, the likely role of bacteria ( Luo et al., 2017 ) and soil fauna ( Bokhorst and Wardle, 2013 ) in fine root decay should be acknowledged. Certainly, the ubiquity and abundance of Mycena spp. in the decaying roots was indicative of its key role in fine root decay; however, Mycena was usually abundant in both intact cores and root litter bags ( Fig. 4 ). In contrast to observations of Li et al. (2015) , ectomycorrhizal fungi were not very abundant in either the root litter bags or the intact cores, and there was only limited support for the hypothesized role of particular ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient mobilization ( Li et al., 2015 ). The one case in which a confirmed ectomycorrhizal fungus was more abundant in decayed than live roots was for Russula in white pine in the intact cores ( Fig. 4 ), and these roots also had among the highest release of N and P among all the samples. Why was the difference in fine root decay rates measured using the intact core vs the root litter bag method smaller than has been noted in other such comparisons for temperate forest trees? Certainly, there were methodological, species and site differences among the studies that could have contributed. However, the most likely explanation is the exhaustive effort expended in the present study to recover essentially all the tiniest (mostly <2 mm) fine root fragments (see Methods ). Because these fragments would be retained by the fine mesh used in root litter bags (50–100 um), they would contribute to the dry weight remaining. We can attest that the amount of fine root fragments not recovered in the present study was insignificant. The mass of these tiny fragments comprised an average of 9.3 % of the AFDW of the remaining sample. Thus, limited recovery of fine fragments might account for the larger discrepancy in decay rates between the two methods in some previous studies that did not report such efforts at fragment recovery. However, at least one study that indicated faster decay for fine roots in intact cores than litter bags ( Dornbush et al., 2002 ) made an exhaustive effort to recover tiny root fragments. Also, we ignored tiny root fragments (<2 mm length) in the pre-incubation cores on the assumption that these mostly dead root fragments would be completely decayed after one year; to the extent that some of these fragments remained, our intact core method would slightly underestimate decay rate. Fine root decay rate values were remarkably similar between the two plots for each of the five species with replicate plots (Table S1) despite differences in soil types and fungal community composition between the pairs. Although all the soils at the site are broadly classified as acidic Inceptisols, the Lordstown soils in Block 1 (Typic Dystrudepts) are well drained whereas in the Mardin and Volusia soils in Block 2 (Aeric Fragiudepts) a fragipan at 20–30 cm depth restricts drainage. Nevertheless, no clear effects of these soil differences on decay rates were evident; average decay rates across species and methods were similar for the two soil types. The obvious importance of Mycena spp. in fine root decay at this site, based on the high proportion of ITS2 reads in the decaying roots for most of the plots and species ( Fig. 4 ), invites some evaluation and speculation. First, Mycena spp. were common in the living fine roots of all the species except black cherry. Mycena is a very common genus of saprotrophic fungi in forest soils ( Boberg et al., 2011 ), and recent evidence indicates that many Mycena spp. can form endophytic associations with tree roots, even including apparent mutualistic interactions ( Thoen et al., 2020 ). Moreover, in some situations Mycena spp. can comprise a high proportion of all the fungal reads in living plant roots ( Harder et al., 2023 ); this matches our observations for four tree species: sugar maple, red maple, red oak, and white pine. Kohout et al. (2018) detected Mycena in living roots of Norway spruce, and following forest clearcutting, Mycena increased greatly in abundance as the roots decomposed. We often observed an overall increase in the relative abundance of Mycena in decaying roots, especially for the intact cores ( Fig. 4 ). These observations raise the interesting possibility that the endophyte status of Mycena may constitute a strategy to gain priority in fine root decomposition, analogous to that noted for wood decay fungi ( Hiscox et al., 2015 ). Note that the prominent exception to the pattern of higher decay in the intact cores than the litter bags was Norway spruce for which unexpectedly rapid decay was observed in the litter bags ( Fig. 1 ). We note that Norway spruce was the only non-native tree species in the present study. Unidentified and uncultured fungal taxa from the Agaricomycetes were uniquely abundant in the spruce root litter bags, and these may have been very rapid decomposers of the spruce fine roots. The fungal community in the present study had some overlap with the aforementioned study of fungal communities of decaying roots in a clearcut Norway spruce plantation in Czech Republic ( Kohout et al., 2018 ), especially Mycena , Philocephala and some ectomycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Cenococcum , Amanita , Tomentella ). Other approaches for estimating fine root decay have been explored, for example, direct observations of root disappearance using minirhizotrons; again, much faster decay has been demonstrated with this approach ( Hendrick and Pregitzer, 1996 ; Song et al., 2008 ) than observations for root litter bags, but artifacts associated with minirhizotron tube effects are possible. Li et al. (2020, 2022) devised an indirect approach for estimating fine root decay rates that reduces some of these weaknesses. Their method is labor intensive combining sequential root coring and minirhizotron observations. Perhaps the most important problem with their method is the difficulty of objectively determining root mortality and identifying and sorting dead roots (i.e., root tissues often die gradually, and dead roots are gradually transformed into coarse particulate organic matter), and the interrelated problem of fine root herbivory which can be substantial ( Gan and Wickings, 2020 ; Stevens and Jones, 2006 ). The approach of Li et al. (2020) would seem to be capable of providing improved estimates of fine root decay rates, especially if the issue of dead vs live roots can be circumvented, and more comparisons with the relatively simple and inexpensive root litter bag approach would be useful. Li et al. (2022) reported about two times higher decay rates by their indirect approach compared with root litter bags in a loblolly pine forest. We also note that the duration of most root decay studies has usually been only one year; problems with root tissue recovery from intact cores precludes longer incubation times. Whether the initial differences in decay rates between methods remain consistent through longer time frames will be challenging to test. In conclusion, the intact core method generally indicated a higher decay rate and nutrient mobilization than the root litter bag method, though the differences were not as large as previously reported. Moreover, the differences in decay rates between the two methods did not correlate consistently with differences in the fungal community. These observations suggest that the less expensive root litter bag method might be only slightly biased towards lower decay rates and can be applied more confidently to evaluate experimental treatment effects on fine root decomposition. Now that we have characterized the fungal communities and identified the potentially important players in root decomposition at this site, it would be useful for future studies to employ methods such as qPCR to assess absolute abundances of these fungal taxa in relation to root decay. Certainly, the results highlight the complexity of quantifying fine root decay and nutrient mobilization and suggest that more research is needed to determine the microbial drivers of root decomposition among tree species.
