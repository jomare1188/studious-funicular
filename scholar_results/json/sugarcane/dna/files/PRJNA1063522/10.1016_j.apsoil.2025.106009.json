    "full_text": "The plant rhizosphere harbors diverse microbes that play critical roles in plant health and productivity. Introducing beneficial microbes as inoculants to modify the rhizosphere community represents a promising approach to sustainable agriculture. Despite this potential, the ecological dynamics governing autochthonous community responses to various synthetic communities (SynComs) are poorly understood. This study assessed the sugarcane rhizosphere community and plant growth following inoculation with three SynComs, namely MetG2, OG10, and Sugarcane2, along with an NPK fertilizer treatment and water as a control. Phenotypic observations of the plants indicated that all SynComs enhanced plant height and number of new tillers compared to the control, showing performance levels comparable to the fertilizer. High-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing unveiled inoculant- and time-dependent alterations in community diversity, composition, and ecologically functional capacities of the sugarcane rhizosphere. Temporal enrichment patterns were observed in taxonomy at both phylum and genus levels. Succession analysis identified distinct amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) induced by different SynComs, with MetG2 having the lowest number of unique declining ASVs , indicating greater compatibility with the existing microbial community. Fertilizer promoted specialist taxa at the early stage, while control, OG10, and MetG2 revealed an opposing trend. A null model analysis indicated strong initial effects of inoculants on deterministic assembly, diminishing over time, particularly in OG10. Taken together, our findings underscored the context-dependent nature of SynCom's effects on rhizosphere community dynamics, shedding light on the potential for tailored microbial inoculation strategies to shape desired ecological outcomes."

          "Sugarcane ( Saccharum sp.) is an economically important crop cultivated across numerous countries globally ( FAOSTAT, 2019 ). Approximately 80 % of sugar stocks worldwide are produced from sugarcane, and Thailand is the world's fourth-largest producer ( FAOSTAT, 2020 ). In the last twenty years, sugarcane has emerged as a crucial crop for energy and biofuel production, owing to its substantial biomass and extensive ethanol generation from molasses. Additionally, it is recognized as the predominant feedstock for synthesizing bio-butanol and diesel, contributing to 40 % of global biofuel production ( Budeguer et al., 2021 ). Given its important contribution to worldwide demands for food and energy security, maximizing the productivity and resilience of sugarcane has emerged as an urgent task.",
          "The rhizosphere, located in the immediate vicinity of plant roots, constitutes a dynamic ecosystem where complex interactions occur among plant roots, soil microorganisms, and the surrounding environment. Root exudates, mucilage, and sloughed cell secretions profoundly influence the biological, chemical, and physical properties of this habitat ( Turner et al., 2013 ). Within the sugarcane rhizosphere, a diverse microbial community comprising archaea, bacteria, and fungi plays pivotal roles in plant health, nutrient acquisition, and stress tolerance ( Armanhi et al., 2018 ; Leelastwattanagul et al., 2023 ). Notably, bacteria belonging to genera such as Azospirillum , Azotobacter , Bacillus , Burkholderia , Enterobacter, Gluconacetobacter , Herbaspirillum , Methylobacterium , Pseudomonas , and Rhizobium have been isolated from sugarcane and demonstrated plant-growth promoting properties ( Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al., 2014 ; Santos and Rigobelo, 2021 ; Singh et al., 2022 ). Currently, the significance of the rhizosphere microbiome is acknowledged as a crucial element in the formulation of biofertilizers, holding great promise for sustainable agriculture ( Hakim et al., 2021 ; Mahmud et al., 2021 ). Therefore, harnessing the plant growth-promoting potential of the rhizosphere microbiome has become an intense research area, aiming to reduce reliance on excessive agrochemical fertilizers while sustainably enhancing sugarcane yields, especially in the face of biotic and abiotic stresses.",
          "Introducing additional microbes into the soil aims to enhance microbiome-associated multifunctionality, offering sustainable alternatives to excessive agrochemical fertilizers and boosting plant growth and productivity ( O'Callaghan et al., 2022 ). This approach involves the application of single-isolate microbial inoculants and synthetic communities (SynComs) ( de Souza et al., 2020 ; Vasseur-Coronado et al., 2021 ; Shayanthan et al., 2022 ). However, the efficacy of these inoculants may vary due to factors such as microbial competitive abilities, niche adaptability, and environmental conditions, including soil pH, moisture, and temperature ( Lopes et al., 2021 ). Notably, previous studies have suggested that SynComs, consisting of various strains with diverse functional capabilities, often outperform single-isolate microbial inoculants in promoting plant growth and providing resilience against stresses ( Saleem et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021 ; Joshi et al., 2023 ; Liu et al., 2023a ). The synergistic interactions among different strains within SynComs could enhance plant nutrient acquisition, disease suppression, and stress tolerance ( de Souza et al., 2020 ; Shayanthan et al., 2022 ). Considering the complexity of microbial interactions when designing microbial inoculants is essential. However, despite the effectiveness of SynComs, our understanding of their interactions with indigenous rhizosphere communities remains limited ( Nikolaidou et al., 2021 ), emphasizing the need to unravel the intricate interactions and ecological dynamics to optimize SynCom application and ensure their sustained benefits in agricultural systems.",
          "To comprehend the success or failure of microbial inoculation, it is crucial to understand the specificity between hosts, plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), and the microbial communities in the rhizosphere. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various SynComs, comprising bacteria with diverse plant-beneficial traits, in enhancing sugarcane growth and modulating the rhizosphere microbial community. The bacterial isolates were selected based on their plant growth-promoting traits, compatibility, and previous successful applications in enhancing plant growth. We hypothesized that (1) SynCom application would enhance sugarcane growth, with the survival and persistence of the individual isolates within each SynCom positively correlating with the degree of plant growth promotion achieved, and (2) different SynCom compositions would have varying effects on both plant growth and rhizosphere microbial community structure. Our findings provide new insights into inoculant-induced shifts in rhizosphere microbial community ecology and dynamics, contributing to our understanding of plant-associated microbiota for advancing sustainable agriculture, particularly for essential crops like sugarcane."

              "Nine bacterial isolates from the culture collection of the Fungal Biotechnology (FGB) laboratory, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand, were selected to construct three SynComs, namely MetG2, OG10, and Sugarcane2. The selection of microbial groups was based on their plant growth-promoting traits, compatibility, and previous successful applications in enhancing plant growth. Previously, all strains were tested as single inoculants and confirmed to promote plant growth [( Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ) and unpublished data]. Compatibility tests were also conducted in vitro using all strains to determine SynCom compositions (unpublished data). It was crucial that all SynComs composed of strains capable of providing essential nutrients (NPK) and represented diverse properties associated with plant growth promotion ( Table 1 ). For instance, the MetG2 and OG10 were assembled based on natural relationships, particularly Methylobacterium and Pseudomonas , which were commonly found co-occurring on plant leaves ( Delmotte et al., 2009 ; Vorholt, 2012 ) and in the rhizosphere ( Grossi et al., 2020 ; Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ; Khoiri et al., 2024 ). The MetG2 inoculant was dominated by Methylobacterium , including the NMS14P strain, while OG10 was predominated by Pseudomonas , excluding the NMS14P strain. The Sugarcane2 comprised Methylobacterium along with other bacteria possessing notable antifungal properties, including BamLE10 and SCD4 strains.",
              "Each bacterium was cultured to the mid-log phase in a half-strength tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium at 25 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. After 15 min of centrifugation at 8000 g , the pellet of each cell culture was collected and washed twice. The washing process involved resuspending the cell pellet in sterile distilled water, followed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min to re-pellet the cells. This washing step was repeated twice to ensure the removal of any residual growth medium. After the final wash, the pellet of each isolate was resuspended in sterile distilled water to a final concentration of 1 × 10 9 CFU/mL. Equal volumes of each bacterial suspension were then combined to prepare the SynCom. Finally, the SynComs were applied to the plant at a final concentration of 1 × 10 6 CFU per gram soil, following the method outlined by Jirakkakul et al. (2023) ."

              "Sugarcane variety KK3 was propagated using cane sets in a 10-in. pot filled with a sterile mix of soil and perlite (3:1). Two-month-old plants at the early tillering stage were inoculated with each of the three SynComs weekly for five consecutive weeks (days 0, 8, 15, 22, and 29, as shown in Fig. S1). Additionally, plants fertilized with NPK fertilizer (16–8-8) or receiving only water were defined as positive and negative controls, respectively. This setup resulted in a total of five independent variables (treatments). The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design (CRD) with eight replications in a controlled growth room at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkhuntien Campus. The growth room conditions were maintained at a temperature of 26 ± 4 °C, relative humidity of 72 ± 5 %, light intensity of 500–600 μmol m −2 s −1 , and a 16/8-h light/dark photoperiod.",
              "The tillering stage represents a crucial phase in the growth and development of sugarcane, initiating the onset of vegetative growth as the plant generates tillers or shoots from the base of the main stalk ( Matsuoka and Stolf, 2012 ). Assessing the effect of SynCom inoculation during this stage provides valuable insights into its influence on early growth patterns and potential implications for overall yield. Thus, in this study, phenotypic observations were conducted from the early tillering stage until near its completion, spanning a period of 63 days after the initial SynCom inoculation. Specifically, plant height and the number of new tillers were assessed at various time points (approximately every month, except for an early observation on day 4), as illustrated in Fig. S1.",
              "Rhizosphere samples were collected in triplicates for DNA extraction on 0, 4, 7, and 14 days after SynComs inoculation (Fig. S1). Sampling within the initial 14 days provides insights into immediate changes in microbial populations and activities, crucial for understanding colonization dynamics and short-term effects on plant-microbe interactions. This early period is essential for establishing introduced microbial strains and assessing their interactions with native rhizosphere microbiota, which influence subsequent plant-microbe interactions and phenotypic outcomes ( Knights et al., 2021 ; Santoyo et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2023b ). Additionally, weekly inoculations created a dynamic environment with continuous disturbances and evolving interactions between inoculants and indigenous microbes. This approach allows us to explore the adaptability, resilience, and stability of microbial communities under continuous disturbances, providing valuable insights into how SynComs establish and influence the rhizosphere over time. To collect rhizosphere samples, the soil around the sugarcane plant was excavated with a sterile spatula to retrieve the roots. Subsequently, five young roots were selected and trimmed to ±10 cm using sterile scissors, vigorously shaken by hand to dislodge adhering soil particles, and transferred to 50 mL Falcon tubes containing 40 mL of 0.9 % NaCl buffer. The Falcon tubes were shaken on an orbital shaker for 10 min, after which the roots were removed. Following centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min, the supernatant was discarded, leaving the pellet, which was stored at −80 °C for subsequent DNA extraction. For each replicate, roots from pots 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 8 were pooled into individual tubes, resulting in a total of three replicates of rhizosphere samples. It is worth noting that this partial-root harvest (non-destructive) method of collecting roots containing rhizosphere soils involved making a small hole near the plant instead of removing the soil from the pot, thereby allowing the plant to grow continuously."

Unassigned ASVs beyond the kingdom level, ASVs assigned as chloroplasts and mitochondria, and singleton and doubleton ASVs were removed from the dataset. An α-rarefaction curve was constructed to determine the optimal sampling depth for rarefaction-based data normalization. Additionally, representative sequences of each ASV were aligned to the complete sequences of the 16S rRNA gene of each bacterial strain used to construct the SynComs to track their survivability throughout the experiment using local BLASTn v.2.14.0 ( Camacho et al., 2009 ) with criteria: 100 % identity and 100 % coverage."

Additionally, the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) test with 999 permutations was performed to investigate the influence of treatment and day on the sugarcane rhizosphere microbial community.

The number of observed ASVs was quantified for each of these environments. Subsequently, the ASV table was randomly permutated 10,000 times to establish a background (null) distribution. The enrichment of observed ASV count compared to the null distribution indicated that the ASVs possessed specialized or generalist characteristics, while non-enriched ASVs were classified as common taxa.

In contrast, SCD4 and CRE5 demonstrated low survival, detected solely on day 0 (Fig. S4)."

              "The greenhouse experiment revealed the significant influence of SynComs on enhancing the growth of sugarcane. Our phenotypic observations, including plant height and the number of new tillers ( Fig. 1 ), exhibited distinct growth-promoting effects across various SynComs, demonstrating their efficacy compared to the control. Notably, these positive impacts were comparable to the fertilizer, with certain SynComs revealing slightly better performance. Specifically, the MetG2 consistently showed the highest plant height throughout the experiment, along with the Sugarcane2 on day 63. Furthermore, the OG10 consistently had the greatest number of new tillers across the experiment and exhibited a significant difference from the control on day 63. These findings validated previous studies highlighting the beneficial impacts of SynComs on plant growth and development ( Armanhi et al., 2018 ; Hu et al., 2021 ; De la Vega-Camarillo et al., 2023 ), emphasizing their potential as an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic fertilizers for sustainable agricultural practices.",
              "In parallel, our investigation into the survivability of individual strains within the SynComs provided crucial insights into the dynamics of introduced microbes over time. The tracking analysis revealed varying levels of survivability among different strains, with the Chiliseed2 and NMS14P_12 strains demonstrating the highest persistence in both MetG2 and Sugarcane2 SynComs. The BAMLE10 strain exhibited moderate survival, whereas NMS19W_CR16 showed limited persistence, and SCD4 and CRE5 strains displayed low survival. The increased plant height observed in MetG2 and Sugarcane2-inoculated plants, which retained high survivability of their inoculated strains throughout the experiment, suggested a positive correlation between inoculant survival and plant growth promotion. However, the low survival of SCD4 and CRE5 strains could be due to interactions with autochthonous microbes or specific abiotic conditions in the rhizosphere. Albright et al. (2022) and Lopes et al. (2021) indicated that antagonistic interactions among microbes or unfavorable abiotic conditions, such as soil pH, temperature, or nutrient availability, could negatively impact the survival of certain strains. Further study is needed to delineate these factors and understand the underlying mechanisms driving these observations. Previous studies have reported that microbial invasions often initiate with a prevailing microbial community, leaving a lasting impact on native soil microbes, even as the introduced populations eventually diminish ( Mallon et al., 2018 ; Mawarda et al., 2022 ). In line with our observations, despite the decline in microbial inoculant abundance over time, particularly noticeable in the OG10 SynCom, phenotypic observations consistently revealed enhanced growth in inoculated sugarcane compared to uninoculated plants. This implied that the observed plant growth benefits might be due to a combination of direct plant growth promotion, such as nutrient provision and phytohormone production, and indirect effects by modulating the rhizosphere community ( Hu et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2022 ), rather than solely the surviving strains. Additionally, the potential positive effects of lysed SynCom cells should not be overlooked. Their death releases nutrients, enzymes, and signaling molecules into the rhizosphere, stimulating microbial activity, enhancing nutrient cycling, and promoting plant growth ( Agake et al., 2022 ; Hayashi et al., 2022 ; Papin et al., 2024 ). This might partly explain the observed growth benefits despite declining inoculant populations."

              "Our analysis of rhizosphere diversity revealed distinct shifts driven by SynCom inoculation. PERMANOVA results indicated that treatments significantly influenced rhizosphere microbial structure (Table S1), corroborating previous findings that SynComs could reshape rhizosphere communities ( Jiménez et al., 2020 ; Hu et al., 2021 ; Kaur et al., 2022 ). FAPROTAX analysis showed an enrichment of microbes associated with denitrification-related processes under fertilizer treatment, particularly on day 4 ( Fig. 5 ). This aligns with previous studies suggesting that excess nitrogen from fertilizer application promotes the proliferation of microbes contributing to potential nitrogen losses, which can negatively affect agricultural productivity and increase environmental pollution ( Wang et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2023 ). In contrast, MetG2 and Sugarcane2 enriched Fe oxidation and aromatic compound degradation processes at different time points ( Fig. 5 ). Iron oxidation, enriched in MetG2, has critical implications for plant growth, as iron is an essential micronutrient involved in various physiological processes ( Kobayashi et al., 2019 ). Similarly, aromatic compound degradation, observed in Sugarcane2, underscored the microbial community's ability to decompose complex organic compounds, promoting soil health and carbon cycling ( Lou et al., 2022 ). These functional shifts highlighted the potential of SynComs to enhance ecosystem functions. However, these findings should be regarded as preliminary; future studies employing shotgun metagenomics or metatranscriptomics are needed to validate these functional trends. Notably, while non-destructive sampling allows the plant to grow continuously, it might affect the rhizosphere microbial community to some extent. Further investigations should assess the potential impacts of non-destructive sampling and repeated inoculations on community dynamics to better understand their influence on experimental outcomes.",
              "A null model analysis revealed that all treatments consistently showed βNTI scores below −2 throughout the experiment. This indicated the dominance of deterministic processes, particularly homogeneous selection, in shaping the sugarcane rhizosphere assembly ( Stegen et al., 2013 ). Notably, on day 4, all treatments had lower βNTI scores compared to the control. While the control also showed deterministic processes with βNTI scores below −2, treatments such as Sugarcane2, OG10, and fertilizer displayed significantly lower scores than the control ( Fig. 7 ). This suggested that, although deterministic processes governed the control, the presence of SynComs and fertilizer treatments exerted a stronger deterministic influence on the microbial community structure compared to the control, highlighting the potential of SynComs to shape assembly processes more profoundly than the control or fertilizer alone. The lower βNTI score suggested a stronger environmental filter imposed by these SynComs, leading to a more homogeneous microbial community structure. This could be attributed to several factors: resource competition, where SynComs dominate niches and efficiently utilize resources; environmental modification, where SynComs alter physical or chemical conditions, favoring certain taxa; disruption of existing microbial interactions, leading to the dominance of better-suited taxa; and the introduction of stress factors, which select for resistant or tolerant microbes ( Mawarda et al., 2020 ; Mawarda et al., 2022 ; Garrido-Sanz et al., 2023 ). However, the OG10 showed a gradual shift toward a balance between stochastic and deterministic processes, indicating a dynamic interplay where environmental filtering and random colonization or extinction events both contribute to shaping the community structure. In contrast, the MetG2 exhibited a consistently stable deterministic assembly, while Sugarcane2 demonstrated the most robust deterministic processes. This indicated that the survivability of the inoculated strains might play a pivotal role in shaping the assembly process of the sugarcane rhizosphere. Specifically, the higher survivability of the inoculated strains might exert a stronger deterministic impact on the assembly process ( Mawarda et al., 2022 ). Overall, our findings underscored the divergent and measurable impacts of SynComs on ecological selection, influencing rhizosphere community assembly."

              "The differential abundance analysis provided insights into temporal dynamics, with various phyla and genera displaying distinct and alternating enrichment patterns between treatments over time. Such temporally shifting enrichment profiles have been noted in previous studies and likely reflect complex ecological interactions as inoculant strains established within the native community ( Wang et al., 2021 ; Mawarda et al., 2022 ). Notably, different SynComs enriched distinct genera of well-known plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), including Flavobacterium , Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Rheinheimera in MetG2; Aneurinibacillus, Bacillus , and Microvirga in OG10; and Actinomycetospora and Burkholderia in Sugarcane2. The increased abundance of these PGPB likely played a significant role in promoting sugarcane growth compared to the control, implying indirect beneficial effects facilitated by SynComs through the enrichment of PGPB in the rhizosphere. This finding aligns with previous works reporting that bacterial inoculants could stimulate the proliferation of beneficial bacteria while reducing the abundance of pathogens in the rhizosphere ( Hu et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2023 ). Moreover, distinct treatments exhibited unique succession patterns of specific ASVs over the observation period. For instance, ASVs taxonomically assigned to orders Rhizobiales, Pirellulales, Thermomicrobiales, and SBR1031 were enriched in MetG2, while Gemmatales, Pirellulales, and Planctomycetales were enriched in Sugarcane2 (Fig. S6). Interestingly, multiple treatments could induce similar successive and declining ASVs, indicating that specific microbial taxa might respond to multiple treatments with varying degrees of abundance and succession patterns. This suggested that these taxa possessed functional versatility and adaptability to different environmental conditions imposed by the treatments. Furthermore, multiple taxa might exhibit similar functional traits or perform overlapping ecological roles (functional redundancy), allowing them to interchangeably respond to different treatments ( Allison and Martiny, 2008 ). MetG2 had the lowest number of declining ASVs , suggesting greater compatibility with the existing microbial community, which promotes beneficial interactions rather than competitive exclusion. Additionally, MetG2 might potentially fill previously underutilized ecological niches, enhancing the overall functionality of the microbial community. In short, different SynComs could induce distinct rhizosphere community composition and succession.",
              "The assessment of specialist and generalist ASVs unveiled how SynComs shape specific ecological niches in the sugarcane rhizosphere. The fertilizer displayed elevated numbers of specialist ASVs on days 4 and 7, suggesting its potential to support specialized taxa in the early experimental stages. In contrast, control, OG10, and MetG2 exhibited a different trend, with specialist ASVs increasing over time. The rise in specialist ASVs in the control and SynCom treatments over the 14-day period implied that the rhizosphere environment might be under selective pressure. This phenomenon could be driven by the nutrient limitations imposed by the growth of plants, which might become more pronounced over the experimental duration and might enhance the selective environment for certain taxa ( Kuzyakov and Xu, 2013 ; Pantigoso et al., 2022 ; Garrido-Sanz et al., 2023 ). While 14 days was relatively short, it was sufficient to observe initial shifts in community composition. Extending the duration of the experiment could provide deeper insights into how nutrient limitations and other environmental factors further influence the diversity and specialization of microbial taxa in the rhizosphere. Further ecologically functional prediction using FAPROTAX showed that the fertilizer induced a specific rhizosphere microbial profile characterized by specialist ASVs possessing various functional traits related to N cycling and other ecological processes. In terms of N metabolism, the fertilizer displayed a significant enrichment in processes associated with nitrate respiration, nitrate reduction, and nitrate denitrification (Fig. S8). The increased abundance of these functional traits suggested an elevated capacity for N transformation via specialist taxa within the rhizosphere microbial community under fertilizer application ( Wang et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2023 ), aligning with the overall ecologically functional prediction discussed earlier. In contrast, the more specialized cellulolytic capacity enriched by MetG2 indicated a niche specialization associated with the degradation of plant polysaccharides. This implied that MetG2 possessed the enzymatic machinery necessary for breaking down complex plant-derived carbohydrates, potentially facilitating the release of carbon sources to support the growth and metabolic activities of specialist microbial taxa ( Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ). Similarly, the prevalence of xylanolytic and ureolytic specialists under OG10 might enhance the mineralization of organic nutrients locked in plant residues and waste products. Bacteria with xylanolytic enzymes can hydrolyze xylan into simpler sugars like xylose, which can then be taken up by plants or utilized by other soil microbes ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 ). Meanwhile, ureolytic bacteria can break down urea, releasing ammonium ions – a readily usable form of nitrogen for plants ( Jin et al., 2017 ). The distinct predicted ecologically functional profiles conferred by inoculations demonstrated that SynComs could steer selection toward desired microbial services in a composition-dependent way. However, these predictions were based on taxonomic affiliations and require validation through high-resolution techniques such as shotgun metagenomics or functional gene analysis. Overall, linking specialist composition with predicted ecological roles provides insights into inoculant effects on rhizosphere functional diversity. This can guide synthetic community design for targeted enrichment of microbial functions supporting plant productivity."

While no significant differences in α-diversity were observed, significant differences in β-diversity were identified, along with distinctive patterns in temporal dynamics, specialist/generalist taxa, and community assembly processes among different SynComs. Among the SynComs tested, MetG2 exhibited the most consistent positive effects on sugarcane growth, making it the most suitable candidate for sugarcane cultivation in this study. MetG2 had the fewest number of declining ASVs , indicating good synergy with the native microbial community by promoting beneficial interactions over competitive exclusion and enhancing the overall functionality of the microbial community. Future research should focus on investigating the links between community dynamics and plant growth promotion in diverse agricultural and environmental contexts.

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Sugarcane ( Saccharum sp.) is an economically important crop cultivated across numerous countries globally ( FAOSTAT, 2019 ). Approximately 80 % of sugar stocks worldwide are produced from sugarcane, and Thailand is the world's fourth-largest producer ( FAOSTAT, 2020 ). In the last twenty years, sugarcane has emerged as a crucial crop for energy and biofuel production, owing to its substantial biomass and extensive ethanol generation from molasses. Additionally, it is recognized as the predominant feedstock for synthesizing bio-butanol and diesel, contributing to 40 % of global biofuel production ( Budeguer et al., 2021 ). Given its important contribution to worldwide demands for food and energy security, maximizing the productivity and resilience of sugarcane has emerged as an urgent task. The rhizosphere, located in the immediate vicinity of plant roots, constitutes a dynamic ecosystem where complex interactions occur among plant roots, soil microorganisms, and the surrounding environment. Root exudates, mucilage, and sloughed cell secretions profoundly influence the biological, chemical, and physical properties of this habitat ( Turner et al., 2013 ). Within the sugarcane rhizosphere, a diverse microbial community comprising archaea, bacteria, and fungi plays pivotal roles in plant health, nutrient acquisition, and stress tolerance ( Armanhi et al., 2018 ; Leelastwattanagul et al., 2023 ). Notably, bacteria belonging to genera such as Azospirillum , Azotobacter , Bacillus , Burkholderia , Enterobacter, Gluconacetobacter , Herbaspirillum , Methylobacterium , Pseudomonas , and Rhizobium have been isolated from sugarcane and demonstrated plant-growth promoting properties ( Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al., 2014 ; Santos and Rigobelo, 2021 ; Singh et al., 2022 ). Currently, the significance of the rhizosphere microbiome is acknowledged as a crucial element in the formulation of biofertilizers, holding great promise for sustainable agriculture ( Hakim et al., 2021 ; Mahmud et al., 2021 ). Therefore, harnessing the plant growth-promoting potential of the rhizosphere microbiome has become an intense research area, aiming to reduce reliance on excessive agrochemical fertilizers while sustainably enhancing sugarcane yields, especially in the face of biotic and abiotic stresses. Introducing additional microbes into the soil aims to enhance microbiome-associated multifunctionality, offering sustainable alternatives to excessive agrochemical fertilizers and boosting plant growth and productivity ( O'Callaghan et al., 2022 ). This approach involves the application of single-isolate microbial inoculants and synthetic communities (SynComs) ( de Souza et al., 2020 ; Vasseur-Coronado et al., 2021 ; Shayanthan et al., 2022 ). However, the efficacy of these inoculants may vary due to factors such as microbial competitive abilities, niche adaptability, and environmental conditions, including soil pH, moisture, and temperature ( Lopes et al., 2021 ). Notably, previous studies have suggested that SynComs, consisting of various strains with diverse functional capabilities, often outperform single-isolate microbial inoculants in promoting plant growth and providing resilience against stresses ( Saleem et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021 ; Joshi et al., 2023 ; Liu et al., 2023a ). The synergistic interactions among different strains within SynComs could enhance plant nutrient acquisition, disease suppression, and stress tolerance ( de Souza et al., 2020 ; Shayanthan et al., 2022 ). Considering the complexity of microbial interactions when designing microbial inoculants is essential. However, despite the effectiveness of SynComs, our understanding of their interactions with indigenous rhizosphere communities remains limited ( Nikolaidou et al., 2021 ), emphasizing the need to unravel the intricate interactions and ecological dynamics to optimize SynCom application and ensure their sustained benefits in agricultural systems. To comprehend the success or failure of microbial inoculation, it is crucial to understand the specificity between hosts, plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), and the microbial communities in the rhizosphere. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various SynComs, comprising bacteria with diverse plant-beneficial traits, in enhancing sugarcane growth and modulating the rhizosphere microbial community. The bacterial isolates were selected based on their plant growth-promoting traits, compatibility, and previous successful applications in enhancing plant growth. We hypothesized that (1) SynCom application would enhance sugarcane growth, with the survival and persistence of the individual isolates within each SynCom positively correlating with the degree of plant growth promotion achieved, and (2) different SynCom compositions would have varying effects on both plant growth and rhizosphere microbial community structure. Our findings provide new insights into inoculant-induced shifts in rhizosphere microbial community ecology and dynamics, contributing to our understanding of plant-associated microbiota for advancing sustainable agriculture, particularly for essential crops like sugarcane. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preparation of microbial inoculum Nine bacterial isolates from the culture collection of the Fungal Biotechnology (FGB) laboratory, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand, were selected to construct three SynComs, namely MetG2, OG10, and Sugarcane2. The selection of microbial groups was based on their plant growth-promoting traits, compatibility, and previous successful applications in enhancing plant growth. Previously, all strains were tested as single inoculants and confirmed to promote plant growth [( Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ) and unpublished data]. Compatibility tests were also conducted in vitro using all strains to determine SynCom compositions (unpublished data). It was crucial that all SynComs composed of strains capable of providing essential nutrients (NPK) and represented diverse properties associated with plant growth promotion ( Table 1 ). For instance, the MetG2 and OG10 were assembled based on natural relationships, particularly Methylobacterium and Pseudomonas , which were commonly found co-occurring on plant leaves ( Delmotte et al., 2009 ; Vorholt, 2012 ) and in the rhizosphere ( Grossi et al., 2020 ; Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ; Khoiri et al., 2024 ). The MetG2 inoculant was dominated by Methylobacterium , including the NMS14P strain, while OG10 was predominated by Pseudomonas , excluding the NMS14P strain. The Sugarcane2 comprised Methylobacterium along with other bacteria possessing notable antifungal properties, including BamLE10 and SCD4 strains. Each bacterium was cultured to the mid-log phase in a half-strength tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium at 25 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. After 15 min of centrifugation at 8000 g , the pellet of each cell culture was collected and washed twice. The washing process involved resuspending the cell pellet in sterile distilled water, followed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min to re-pellet the cells. This washing step was repeated twice to ensure the removal of any residual growth medium. After the final wash, the pellet of each isolate was resuspended in sterile distilled water to a final concentration of 1 × 10 9 CFU/mL. Equal volumes of each bacterial suspension were then combined to prepare the SynCom. Finally, the SynComs were applied to the plant at a final concentration of 1 × 10 6 CFU per gram soil, following the method outlined by Jirakkakul et al. (2023) . 2.2 Microbial inoculant experiment Sugarcane variety KK3 was propagated using cane sets in a 10-in. pot filled with a sterile mix of soil and perlite (3:1). Two-month-old plants at the early tillering stage were inoculated with each of the three SynComs weekly for five consecutive weeks (days 0, 8, 15, 22, and 29, as shown in Fig. S1). Additionally, plants fertilized with NPK fertilizer (16–8-8) or receiving only water were defined as positive and negative controls, respectively. This setup resulted in a total of five independent variables (treatments). The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design (CRD) with eight replications in a controlled growth room at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkhuntien Campus. The growth room conditions were maintained at a temperature of 26 ± 4 °C, relative humidity of 72 ± 5 %, light intensity of 500–600 μmol m −2 s −1 , and a 16/8-h light/dark photoperiod. The tillering stage represents a crucial phase in the growth and development of sugarcane, initiating the onset of vegetative growth as the plant generates tillers or shoots from the base of the main stalk ( Matsuoka and Stolf, 2012 ). Assessing the effect of SynCom inoculation during this stage provides valuable insights into its influence on early growth patterns and potential implications for overall yield. Thus, in this study, phenotypic observations were conducted from the early tillering stage until near its completion, spanning a period of 63 days after the initial SynCom inoculation. Specifically, plant height and the number of new tillers were assessed at various time points (approximately every month, except for an early observation on day 4), as illustrated in Fig. S1. Rhizosphere samples were collected in triplicates for DNA extraction on 0, 4, 7, and 14 days after SynComs inoculation (Fig. S1). Sampling within the initial 14 days provides insights into immediate changes in microbial populations and activities, crucial for understanding colonization dynamics and short-term effects on plant-microbe interactions. This early period is essential for establishing introduced microbial strains and assessing their interactions with native rhizosphere microbiota, which influence subsequent plant-microbe interactions and phenotypic outcomes ( Knights et al., 2021 ; Santoyo et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2023b ). Additionally, weekly inoculations created a dynamic environment with continuous disturbances and evolving interactions between inoculants and indigenous microbes. This approach allows us to explore the adaptability, resilience, and stability of microbial communities under continuous disturbances, providing valuable insights into how SynComs establish and influence the rhizosphere over time. To collect rhizosphere samples, the soil around the sugarcane plant was excavated with a sterile spatula to retrieve the roots. Subsequently, five young roots were selected and trimmed to ±10 cm using sterile scissors, vigorously shaken by hand to dislodge adhering soil particles, and transferred to 50 mL Falcon tubes containing 40 mL of 0.9 % NaCl buffer. The Falcon tubes were shaken on an orbital shaker for 10 min, after which the roots were removed. Following centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min, the supernatant was discarded, leaving the pellet, which was stored at −80 °C for subsequent DNA extraction. For each replicate, roots from pots 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 8 were pooled into individual tubes, resulting in a total of three replicates of rhizosphere samples. It is worth noting that this partial-root harvest (non-destructive) method of collecting roots containing rhizosphere soils involved making a small hole near the plant instead of removing the soil from the pot, thereby allowing the plant to grow continuously. 2.3 DNA extraction and sequencing Rhizosphere microbial DNA was extracted using the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to manufacturer instructions. The quality and quantity of the extracted DNA were measured using 1 % gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop spectrophotometer, respectively. A DNA library was prepared for each rhizosphere sample using a two-step PCR amplification protocol. The amplification was carried out to target the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using the paired primers 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). Subsequently, the resulting amplicon libraries were sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq 2 × 300 bp paired-end sequencing platform (Illumina, United States). The Illumina raw sequence reads have been deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive ( SRA ) database under BioProject accession number PRJNA1063522 with SRA accession numbers SAMN39398350-SAMN39398409. 2.4 Amplicon data processing FastQC v.0.12.1 ( Andrews, 2010 ) was used to assess the quality of Illumina raw reads. The amplicon data processing was subsequently carried out using Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) v.2023.7 ( Bolyen et al., 2019 ). Briefly, sequence reads were filtered, denoised, dereplicated, and merged using DADA2 v.1.26.0 ( Callahan et al., 2016 ), resulting in the generation of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Taxonomic assignments for each ASV were performed using the SILVA 138 database with a scikit-learn naive Bayes classifier. Unassigned ASVs beyond the kingdom level, ASVs assigned as chloroplasts and mitochondria, and singleton and doubleton ASVs were removed from the dataset. An α-rarefaction curve was constructed to determine the optimal sampling depth for rarefaction-based data normalization. Additionally, representative sequences of each ASV were aligned to the complete sequences of the 16S rRNA gene of each bacterial strain used to construct the SynComs to track their survivability throughout the experiment using local BLASTn v.2.14.0 ( Camacho et al., 2009 ) with criteria: 100 % identity and 100 % coverage. 2.5 Diversity analysis To compare the α-diversity of sugarcane rhizosphere among treatments on each observation day, the LSD test was conducted using the Shannon (richness) and Pielou (evenness) indices. The β-diversity was calculated based on the Bray-Curtis distance and visualized using a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot. Additionally, the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) test with 999 permutations was performed to investigate the influence of treatment and day on the sugarcane rhizosphere microbial community. This was followed by the BETADISPER test to confirm the assumption of variance homogeneity between groups. Subsequently, pairwise comparisons between treatments were executed using R package pairwiseAdonis v.0.4.1 ( Martinez Arbizu, 2020 ) with P -value adjustment by the Bonferroni-Hochberg (BH) method to account for multiple comparisons. All diversity analyses were carried out in R v.4.3.1 ( R Core Team, 2023 ) using R packages, including phyloseq v.1.46.0 ( McMurdie and Holmes, 2013 ), vegan v.2.6.4 ( Oksanen et al., 2019 ), ggplot2 v.3.4.4 ( Wickham, 2016 ), and agricolae v.1.3.6 ( Mendiburu and Yaseen, 2020 ). 2.6 Identification of specialists and generalists of observed ASVs Generalist and specialist ASVs were identified following previous studies ( Sriswasdi et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). The current research treated each treatment and day as a separate environment, resulting in 20 distinct environments (5 treatments × 4 dates). The number of observed ASVs was quantified for each of these environments. Subsequently, the ASV table was randomly permutated 10,000 times to establish a background (null) distribution. The enrichment of observed ASV count compared to the null distribution indicated that the ASVs possessed specialized or generalist characteristics, while non-enriched ASVs were classified as common taxa. Furthermore, the differentiation between generalists and specialists was confirmed using the niche breadth index, calculated according to Levin's niche breadth index: niche breadth = 1 ∑ i = 1 N P ij 2 where P ij is the relative abundance of ASV j in a given environment i ( Liao et al., 2016 ). 2.7 Modeling bacterial assembly processes To explore the assembly process of the sugarcane rhizosphere community in response to SynComs, a null model framework incorporating phylogenetic information was utilized. A Mantel correlation between ASV niche distance and phylogenetic distance was conducted, with 999 randomizations, using the R package vegan v.2.6.4 ( Oksanen et al., 2019 ) to evaluate the potential association between the phylogenetic relatedness of taxa within the community and their ecological similarity. The analysis revealed significant positive correlations (adj. P < 0.05) across short phylogenetic distances in all treatments (Fig. S2). A null model approach was adopted based on previous studies to assess the importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in rhizosphere microbial assembly ( Stegen et al., 2013 ; Stegen et al., 2015 ). Specifically, the quantification of phylogenetic turnover was carried out by computing the abundance-weighted β-mean nearest taxon distance (βMNTD) using the R package picante v.1.8.2 ( Kembel et al., 2010 ). The null βMNTD distribution was generated by 999 randomizing the tips of the phylogeny (observed ASVs). The evaluation of the extent and direction of deviation between the observed βMNTD value and the null βMNTD distribution was referred to as the weighted β-nearest taxon index (βNTI), as proposed by Stegen et al. (2013) : βNTI = observed βMNTD − null βMNTD sd null βMNTD A |βNTI| > 2 revealed a pronounced deviation of the observed βMNTD from stochastic phylogenetic turnover (null βMNTD), implying that changes in community composition were driven by deterministic processes. Particularly, a βNTI < −2 and βNTI > +2 indicated that phylogenetic turnover was influenced by homogeneous selection and heterogeneous selection, respectively. On the other hand, βNTI values falling within the −2 to +2 range indicated that the observed βMNTD was not significantly deviated from the null βMNTD, implying that communities were assembled through stochastic processes. 2.8 Microbial ecological functional group predictions To gain insights into the functional attributes of the microbial community in response to SynCom inoculations, an ecologically functional prediction was carried out with FAPROTAX v.1.2.7 ( Louca et al., 2016 ) using default parameters. This method transforms taxonomic microbial community profiles, such as an ASV table derived from 16S rRNA-based amplicon sequencing, into inferred functional profiles, relying on the taxa (e.g., genus or species) detected within a given sample, which are then mapped to the functional annotation information of the cultured prokaryotes. 2.9 Differential abundance analysis Differential abundance analysis was performed using LEfSe v.1.1 ( Segata et al., 2011 ). This analysis aimed to identify specific taxa and ecologically functional traits that exhibited significant variations in abundance among different treatments. LEfSe combines traditional statistics, i.e., non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests, with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to detect potential biomarkers of different conditions. In the present study, a LDA score of 2.0 and a P -value of 0.05 were used. Finally, the outcomes were graphically presented in bar graphs employing the R package ggplot2 v.3.4.4 ( Wickham, 2016 ). 2.10 Statistical analysis Plant phenotypic data were statistically compared among treatments using the least significant difference (LSD) test with R package agricolae v.1.3.6 ( Mendiburu and Yaseen, 2020 ) and visualized using the R package ggplot2 v.3.4.4 ( Wickham, 2016 ). 3 Results 3.1 Effect of SynComs on sugarcane growth The MetG2 consistently exhibited the highest plant height compared to the control, with statistically significant differences observed on days 25, 39, and 63 ( Fig. 1 A ). Fertilizer significantly increased plant height on days 25 and 39, while Sugarcane2 on day 63 ( Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the OG10 slightly enhanced plant height compared to the control across all time points ( Fig. 1 A). Regarding the number of new tillers, all treatments showed an increase in the number of tillers compared to the control, with OG10 being significantly different from the control on day 63 ( Fig. 1 B). However, none of the SynComs showed significant differences compared to fertilizer in either plant height or tiller count. Interestingly, on day 63, MetG2 and Sugarcane2 exhibited slightly greater plant height than the fertilizer treatment, while OG10 and MetG2 produced slightly more tillers than fertilizer. These findings emphasized the potential of specific SynComs in positively influencing sugarcane growth, offering promising implications for agricultural practices. 3.2 Statistics of amplicon data A total of 10,969,576 paired-end reads with an average length of 272 bases were acquired from 60 sugarcane rhizosphere samples. These sequences underwent a series of processing steps, resulting in the generation of 11,430 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and their distribution varied across samples, ranging from 694 to 3228. After eliminating unassigned ASVs beyond the kingdom level, ASVs assigned as chloroplasts and mitochondria, and singleton and doubleton ASVs, a total of 9333 ASVs were retained. Moreover, the rarefaction curve exhibited a plateau, implying that the sequencing depth of the samples sufficiently represented the species diversity within the samples (Fig. S3). Accordingly, to ensure uniformity in ASV abundance data for subsequent downstream analyses, a rarefying method was employed to down-sample the reads to 17,000 reads per sample. 3.3 Tracking the survival of bacterial inoculants To track the survivability of individual strains after inoculation, the representative sequences of each ASV were rigorously aligned with full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences of all strains using BLASTn, applying stringent criteria of 100 % identity and 100 % coverage for the V4-region. Some strains exhibited identical V4-region sequences, such as NMS14 with NMS12 and NMS19W with CR16, leading to ambiguous distinctions. Consequently, these were denoted as NMS14_12 and NMS19W_CR16, respectively. Our tracking analysis revealed distinctive survivability patterns among these strains within the tested SynComs. Chiliseed2 demonstrated the highest survivability, consistently presented in all observation days within MetG2 and Sugarcane2 SynComs, followed by NMS14P_12 (Fig. S4). The BAMLE10 displayed moderate survival, observed in relatively lower abundance on day 14 (Fig. S4). Similarly, NMS19W also exhibited moderate survival, appearing in limited numbers on day 4 and absent on days 7 and 14 (Fig. S4). In contrast, SCD4 and CRE5 demonstrated low survival, detected solely on day 0 (Fig. S4). 3.4 Effect of SynComs on sugarcane rhizosphere diversity The α-diversity of the sugarcane rhizosphere was assessed using Shannon and Pielou indices at the ASV level. Trends in species richness and evenness were observed across different treatments and days. However, statistical analysis using the LSD test indicated no significant differences ( P > 0.05) in both indices between treatments over time ( Fig. 2 A , Fig. 2 B). Similarly, comparisons of species richness and evenness within the same treatment between days revealed no statistical significance (P > 0.05) (Fig. S5). PERMANOVA results revealed a significant impact of treatment (R 2 = 0.17, P = 0.001 ***) on the sugarcane rhizosphere community structure (Table S1). Additionally, there was a significant but smaller effect of the day (R 2 = 0.09, P = 0.002 **), with no significant interaction between treatment and day (P > 0.05) (Table S1). BETADISPER tests indicated no significant differences in within-group dispersion ( P = 0.064 for treatment and P = 0.193 for day) (Table S1), suggesting that the observed microbial β-diversity dissimilarities were due to differences in group centroids rather than dispersion. The PCoA plot revealed distinct clusters of some rhizosphere samples based on treatment, with the first and second axes explaining 25 % and 9 % of the variation, respectively ( Fig. 2 C). Specifically, MetG2 displayed a significantly different rhizosphere microbial profile compared to all treatments except the control ( Fig. 2 C, Table S1). OG10 exhibited a unique profile compared to MetG2 and the control but not compared to fertilizer and Sugarcane2 ( Fig. 2 C, Table S1). Sugarcane2 had a distinct profile compared to MetG2, fertilizer, and the control but was similar to OG10 ( Fig. 2 C, Table S1). 3.5 Effect of SynComs on the rhizosphere community composition At the phylum level, microbial communities were primarily dominated by Proteobacteria, accounting for over 30 % of the total composition, followed by Actinobacteriota at >10 % throughout the experiment ( Fig. 3 A ). Other notable microbial phyla with a total relative abundance exceeding 1 % across all treatments and observation days included Firmicutes (9.20 %), Bacteroidota (8.25 %), Chloroflexi (8.10 %), Planctomycetota (6.96 %), Acidobacteriota (6.33 %), Verrucomicrobiota (5.11 %), Myxococcota (3.41 %), Gemmatimonadota (2.69 %), and Crenarchaeota (2.69 %) ( Fig. 3 A). Differential abundance analysis was conducted at both the phylum and genus levels to compare the enrichment of specific taxa in response to varying SynComs applications across different days. The results revealed that, at the phylum level, the MetG2 consistently enriched the abundance of Proteobacteria from day 4 to day 14 and Nanoarchaeota on days 0 and 14 ( Fig. 3 B). Bacteroidota, Myxococcota, and Bdellovibrionota exhibited specific enrichment in control ( Fig. 3 B). OG10 increased the abundance of WS2 and MBNT15, while Sugarcane2 enriched the abundance of Chloroflexi, and the fertilizer led to an increased abundance of Cyanobacteria and Thermoplasmatota ( Fig. 3 B). Additionally, Verrucomicrobiota, Fibrobacterota, and Elusimicrobiota displayed alternating enrichment patterns in both the control and MetG2 ( Fig. 3 B). Spirochaetota showed increased abundance in both the control and fertilizer, while Planctomycetota exhibited increased abundance in the fertilizer and Sugarcane2 ( Fig. 3 B). At the genus level, the results unveiled the highly dynamic temporal patterns of sugarcane rhizosphere enrichment. For instance, genera such as PAUC26f , Phaeodactylibacter , f__Microscillaceae, f__Cryomorphaceae, Blfdi19 , Planctopirus , TRA3–20 , IS−44 , Hydrogenophaga , f__Micavibrionaceae, and f__Pedosphaeraceae exhibited alternating abundance between the control and MetG2 ( Fig. 4 ). Genus Collinsella displayed enrichment in the OG10, Sugarcane2, and fertilizer on days 4, 7, and 14, respectively ( Fig. 4 ). Genera such as g__Fimbriimonadaceae, env.OPS_17 , Rheinheimera , Pseudomonas , Methylobacterium , and CCD24 consistently demonstrated enrichment on multiple observation days in the MetG2, while Marinoscillum , Inhella , and Lacunisphaera consistently exhibited enrichment in control ( Fig. 4 ). Genus Bacillus was enriched on multiple observation days in the OG10, whereas no genera consistently exhibited enrichment in the fertilizer and Sugarcane2 for at least 2 days of observation ( Fig. 4 ). In short, these findings offer valuable insights into the distinct responses of microbial taxa to various SynComs over the experimental period, contributing to a deeper understanding of rhizosphere dynamics. 3.6 Effect of SynComs on succession and decline patterns of rhizosphere community Succession patterns of bacterial taxa in response to SynComs were analyzed by identifying ASVs whose abundances showed a consistent increase or decrease over the course of the experiment and were statistically different between the start (day 0) and the end (day 14) of the observation period. In control, fertilizer, MetG2, OG10, and Sugarcane2, a total of 40, 54, 46, 6, and 28 ASVs, respectively, displayed an increasing trend, referred to as “ successive ASV ” (Fig. S6). Conversely, in the same treatments, 22, 22, 17, 30, and 19 ASVs, respectively, exhibited a decreasing trend, referred to as “ declining ASV ” (Fig. S6). A Venn diagram was used as a visualization tool to further explore potential overlaps of successive and declining ASVs across treatments. The results revealed the shared patterns of both types of ASVs between some treatments (Fig. S7). Moreover, the fertilizer exhibited the highest number of unique successive ASVs (40 ASVs; predominated by order SBR1031), followed by the MetG2 (predominated by orders Rhizobiales, Pirellulales, Thermomicrobiales, and SBR1031) and the control (predominated by orders Burkholderiales and SBR1031), each with 30 ASVs (Fig. S7A). In contrast, the Sugarcane2 had 17 unique successive ASVs (predominated by orders Gemmatales, Pirellulales, and Planctomycetales), while OG10 had 4 (no predominant pattern) (Fig. S7A). In terms of unique declining ASVs , OG10 had the highest count with 22 ASVs (predominated by orders Burkholderiales, Cytophagales, Kapabacteriales, Pirellulales, Saccharimonadales, and Verrucomicrobiales), followed by the control with 19 ASVs (predominated by order Burkholderiales), Sugarcane2 with 16 ASVs (predominated by orders Chitinophagales and Opitutales), fertilizer with 12 ASVs (predominated by order Rhizobiales), and MetG2 with 11 ASVs (no predominant pattern) (Fig. S7B). 3.7 Effect of SynComs on ecologically functional groups of rhizosphere community FAPROTAX results revealed that, in total, chemoheterotrophy was the predominant microbial trait, accounting for 41.23 %, followed by aerobic chemoheterotrophy (28.19 %), aerobic ammonia oxidation (4.19 %), nitrification (4.19 %), nitrate reduction (2.62 %), predatory or exoparasitic (2.11 %), chitinolysis (1.93 %), methylotrophy (1.79 %), methanol oxidation (1.79 %), aromatic compound degradation (1.53 %), dark hydrogen oxidation (1.37 %), ureolysis (1.04 %), and other traits with abundances <1 % ( Fig. 5 ). LEfSe results showed that ureolysis and aromatic compound degradation were enriched in the MetG2 and Sugarcane2, respectively, on day 0 ( Fig. 5 ). The fertilizer displayed a distinct enrichment pattern, including phototrophy, photoautotrophy, nitrous oxide denitrification, nitrite respiration, nitrite denitrification, nitrate denitrification, and denitrification on day 4 ( Fig. 5 ). Meanwhile, the control exhibited increased levels of predatory or exoparasitic, methylotrophy, methanol oxidation, dark oxidation of sulfur compounds, and cellulolysis on the same day ( Fig. 5 ). Additionally, the MetG2 exhibited an enrichment of dark iron oxidation and dark hydrogen oxidation ( Fig. 5 ). On day 7, enrichments in the fertilizer, particularly in xylanolysis, mammal gut, and human gut, were observed ( Fig. 5 ). In contrast, the control and Sugarcane2 showed enrichments in dark hydrogen oxidation and aromatic compound degradation, respectively, on this day ( Fig. 5 ). Lastly, on day 14, the MetG2 and Sugarcane2 displayed enrichment in dark iron (Fe) oxidation and aromatic compound degradation, respectively ( Fig. 5 ). Furthermore, the control exhibited an enrichment of photoautotrophy, dark hydrogen oxidation, anoxygenic photoautotrophy S oxidizing, and anoxygenic photoautotrophy ( Fig. 5 ). 3.8 Effect of SynComs on specialist and generalist ASVs A total of 3294 ASVs were categorized as specialists (enriched in a single environment), and 1003 ASVs were classified as generalists (enriched in >15 environments), with the remaining ASVs considered common species ( Fig. 6 A ). To further confirm the differentiation between specialists and generalists, the niche breadth for each ASV was calculated. As expected, the ASVs classified as generalists displayed a broader niche breadth compared to the specialists ( Fig. 6 B). Notably, the fertilizer exhibited higher numbers of specialist ASVs on days 4 (LSD test; P > 0.05) and 7 (LSD test; P < 0.05) in comparison to all other treatments but had fewer specialist ASVs than the OG10, control, and MetG2 on day 14 (LSD test; P > 0.05) ( Fig. 6 C). In terms of generalist taxa, the fertilizer consistently maintained higher numbers of generalist ASVs than the other treatments throughout the experiment ( Fig. 6 D). While the other treatments had more generalist ASVs on day 14 compared to day 0, the OG10 exhibited the opposite trend ( Fig. 6 D). The ecologically functional prediction of specialist ASVs, as determined by FAPROTAX, highlighted distinct profiles among the treatments. The fertilizer exhibited a significant predominance of functional traits such as chemoheterotrophy, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, predatory or exoparasitic activity, photoheterotrophy, nonphotosynthetic cyanobacteria, photosynthetic cyanobacteria, nitrate respiration, nitrate reduction, nitrate denitrification, methanol oxidation, and dark hydrogen oxidation (Fig. S8). Notably, cellulolysis was significantly enriched in the MetG2, while OG10 exhibited significant prevalence in xylanolysis, ureolysis, and nitrate reduction, particularly on day 14 (Fig. S8). Interestingly, nitrogen fixation was significantly higher in the control on day 4. In contrast, the Sugarcane2 did not exhibit significantly dominant functions (Fig. S8). 3.9 Effect of SynComs on bacterial assembly process The β-nearest taxon index (βNTI) scores for all treatments consistently remained below −2, implying that deterministic processes, particularly homogeneous selection, predominantly governed the assembly of the sugarcane rhizosphere ( Fig. 7 ). However, the OG10 displayed a gradual increase in βNTI scores over time, suggesting a shift toward a balance between stochastic and deterministic processes ( Fig. 7 ). In contrast, the MetG2 exhibited a sustained deterministic process ( Fig. 7 ). Additionally, the control, fertilizer, and Sugarcane2 displayed a more dynamic pattern, with the latter showing the highest level of deterministic processes on days 4 and 14 ( Fig. 7 ). 4 Discussion In recent years, there has been a growing interest in harnessing the potential of rhizosphere microbes to boost crop growth and overall productivity ( Hakim et al., 2021 ; Mahmud et al., 2021 ). A notable approach in this pursuit involves modifying the rhizosphere microbial community by introducing beneficial SynComs ( de Souza et al., 2020 ; Marín et al., 2021 ; Shayanthan et al., 2022 ). The primary objective of this research was to elucidate the influence of different SynComs on the rhizosphere community and, ultimately, their implications for the growth and development of sugarcane. 4.1 Survival of SynComs and their impacts on sugarcane growth The greenhouse experiment revealed the significant influence of SynComs on enhancing the growth of sugarcane. Our phenotypic observations, including plant height and the number of new tillers ( Fig. 1 ), exhibited distinct growth-promoting effects across various SynComs, demonstrating their efficacy compared to the control. Notably, these positive impacts were comparable to the fertilizer, with certain SynComs revealing slightly better performance. Specifically, the MetG2 consistently showed the highest plant height throughout the experiment, along with the Sugarcane2 on day 63. Furthermore, the OG10 consistently had the greatest number of new tillers across the experiment and exhibited a significant difference from the control on day 63. These findings validated previous studies highlighting the beneficial impacts of SynComs on plant growth and development ( Armanhi et al., 2018 ; Hu et al., 2021 ; De la Vega-Camarillo et al., 2023 ), emphasizing their potential as an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic fertilizers for sustainable agricultural practices. In parallel, our investigation into the survivability of individual strains within the SynComs provided crucial insights into the dynamics of introduced microbes over time. The tracking analysis revealed varying levels of survivability among different strains, with the Chiliseed2 and NMS14P_12 strains demonstrating the highest persistence in both MetG2 and Sugarcane2 SynComs. The BAMLE10 strain exhibited moderate survival, whereas NMS19W_CR16 showed limited persistence, and SCD4 and CRE5 strains displayed low survival. The increased plant height observed in MetG2 and Sugarcane2-inoculated plants, which retained high survivability of their inoculated strains throughout the experiment, suggested a positive correlation between inoculant survival and plant growth promotion. However, the low survival of SCD4 and CRE5 strains could be due to interactions with autochthonous microbes or specific abiotic conditions in the rhizosphere. Albright et al. (2022) and Lopes et al. (2021) indicated that antagonistic interactions among microbes or unfavorable abiotic conditions, such as soil pH, temperature, or nutrient availability, could negatively impact the survival of certain strains. Further study is needed to delineate these factors and understand the underlying mechanisms driving these observations. Previous studies have reported that microbial invasions often initiate with a prevailing microbial community, leaving a lasting impact on native soil microbes, even as the introduced populations eventually diminish ( Mallon et al., 2018 ; Mawarda et al., 2022 ). In line with our observations, despite the decline in microbial inoculant abundance over time, particularly noticeable in the OG10 SynCom, phenotypic observations consistently revealed enhanced growth in inoculated sugarcane compared to uninoculated plants. This implied that the observed plant growth benefits might be due to a combination of direct plant growth promotion, such as nutrient provision and phytohormone production, and indirect effects by modulating the rhizosphere community ( Hu et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2022 ), rather than solely the surviving strains. Additionally, the potential positive effects of lysed SynCom cells should not be overlooked. Their death releases nutrients, enzymes, and signaling molecules into the rhizosphere, stimulating microbial activity, enhancing nutrient cycling, and promoting plant growth ( Agake et al., 2022 ; Hayashi et al., 2022 ; Papin et al., 2024 ). This might partly explain the observed growth benefits despite declining inoculant populations. 4.2 SynComs altered diversity, ecological function, and assembly processes of sugarcane rhizosphere Our analysis of rhizosphere diversity revealed distinct shifts driven by SynCom inoculation. PERMANOVA results indicated that treatments significantly influenced rhizosphere microbial structure (Table S1), corroborating previous findings that SynComs could reshape rhizosphere communities ( Jiménez et al., 2020 ; Hu et al., 2021 ; Kaur et al., 2022 ). FAPROTAX analysis showed an enrichment of microbes associated with denitrification-related processes under fertilizer treatment, particularly on day 4 ( Fig. 5 ). This aligns with previous studies suggesting that excess nitrogen from fertilizer application promotes the proliferation of microbes contributing to potential nitrogen losses, which can negatively affect agricultural productivity and increase environmental pollution ( Wang et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2023 ). In contrast, MetG2 and Sugarcane2 enriched Fe oxidation and aromatic compound degradation processes at different time points ( Fig. 5 ). Iron oxidation, enriched in MetG2, has critical implications for plant growth, as iron is an essential micronutrient involved in various physiological processes ( Kobayashi et al., 2019 ). Similarly, aromatic compound degradation, observed in Sugarcane2, underscored the microbial community's ability to decompose complex organic compounds, promoting soil health and carbon cycling ( Lou et al., 2022 ). These functional shifts highlighted the potential of SynComs to enhance ecosystem functions. However, these findings should be regarded as preliminary; future studies employing shotgun metagenomics or metatranscriptomics are needed to validate these functional trends. Notably, while non-destructive sampling allows the plant to grow continuously, it might affect the rhizosphere microbial community to some extent. Further investigations should assess the potential impacts of non-destructive sampling and repeated inoculations on community dynamics to better understand their influence on experimental outcomes. A null model analysis revealed that all treatments consistently showed βNTI scores below −2 throughout the experiment. This indicated the dominance of deterministic processes, particularly homogeneous selection, in shaping the sugarcane rhizosphere assembly ( Stegen et al., 2013 ). Notably, on day 4, all treatments had lower βNTI scores compared to the control. While the control also showed deterministic processes with βNTI scores below −2, treatments such as Sugarcane2, OG10, and fertilizer displayed significantly lower scores than the control ( Fig. 7 ). This suggested that, although deterministic processes governed the control, the presence of SynComs and fertilizer treatments exerted a stronger deterministic influence on the microbial community structure compared to the control, highlighting the potential of SynComs to shape assembly processes more profoundly than the control or fertilizer alone. The lower βNTI score suggested a stronger environmental filter imposed by these SynComs, leading to a more homogeneous microbial community structure. This could be attributed to several factors: resource competition, where SynComs dominate niches and efficiently utilize resources; environmental modification, where SynComs alter physical or chemical conditions, favoring certain taxa; disruption of existing microbial interactions, leading to the dominance of better-suited taxa; and the introduction of stress factors, which select for resistant or tolerant microbes ( Mawarda et al., 2020 ; Mawarda et al., 2022 ; Garrido-Sanz et al., 2023 ). However, the OG10 showed a gradual shift toward a balance between stochastic and deterministic processes, indicating a dynamic interplay where environmental filtering and random colonization or extinction events both contribute to shaping the community structure. In contrast, the MetG2 exhibited a consistently stable deterministic assembly, while Sugarcane2 demonstrated the most robust deterministic processes. This indicated that the survivability of the inoculated strains might play a pivotal role in shaping the assembly process of the sugarcane rhizosphere. Specifically, the higher survivability of the inoculated strains might exert a stronger deterministic impact on the assembly process ( Mawarda et al., 2022 ). Overall, our findings underscored the divergent and measurable impacts of SynComs on ecological selection, influencing rhizosphere community assembly. 4.3 SynComs stimulated distinct indigenous and beneficial rhizosphere microbes to promote sugarcane growth The differential abundance analysis provided insights into temporal dynamics, with various phyla and genera displaying distinct and alternating enrichment patterns between treatments over time. Such temporally shifting enrichment profiles have been noted in previous studies and likely reflect complex ecological interactions as inoculant strains established within the native community ( Wang et al., 2021 ; Mawarda et al., 2022 ). Notably, different SynComs enriched distinct genera of well-known plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), including Flavobacterium , Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Rheinheimera in MetG2; Aneurinibacillus, Bacillus , and Microvirga in OG10; and Actinomycetospora and Burkholderia in Sugarcane2. The increased abundance of these PGPB likely played a significant role in promoting sugarcane growth compared to the control, implying indirect beneficial effects facilitated by SynComs through the enrichment of PGPB in the rhizosphere. This finding aligns with previous works reporting that bacterial inoculants could stimulate the proliferation of beneficial bacteria while reducing the abundance of pathogens in the rhizosphere ( Hu et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2023 ). Moreover, distinct treatments exhibited unique succession patterns of specific ASVs over the observation period. For instance, ASVs taxonomically assigned to orders Rhizobiales, Pirellulales, Thermomicrobiales, and SBR1031 were enriched in MetG2, while Gemmatales, Pirellulales, and Planctomycetales were enriched in Sugarcane2 (Fig. S6). Interestingly, multiple treatments could induce similar successive and declining ASVs, indicating that specific microbial taxa might respond to multiple treatments with varying degrees of abundance and succession patterns. This suggested that these taxa possessed functional versatility and adaptability to different environmental conditions imposed by the treatments. Furthermore, multiple taxa might exhibit similar functional traits or perform overlapping ecological roles (functional redundancy), allowing them to interchangeably respond to different treatments ( Allison and Martiny, 2008 ). MetG2 had the lowest number of declining ASVs , suggesting greater compatibility with the existing microbial community, which promotes beneficial interactions rather than competitive exclusion. Additionally, MetG2 might potentially fill previously underutilized ecological niches, enhancing the overall functionality of the microbial community. In short, different SynComs could induce distinct rhizosphere community composition and succession. The assessment of specialist and generalist ASVs unveiled how SynComs shape specific ecological niches in the sugarcane rhizosphere. The fertilizer displayed elevated numbers of specialist ASVs on days 4 and 7, suggesting its potential to support specialized taxa in the early experimental stages. In contrast, control, OG10, and MetG2 exhibited a different trend, with specialist ASVs increasing over time. The rise in specialist ASVs in the control and SynCom treatments over the 14-day period implied that the rhizosphere environment might be under selective pressure. This phenomenon could be driven by the nutrient limitations imposed by the growth of plants, which might become more pronounced over the experimental duration and might enhance the selective environment for certain taxa ( Kuzyakov and Xu, 2013 ; Pantigoso et al., 2022 ; Garrido-Sanz et al., 2023 ). While 14 days was relatively short, it was sufficient to observe initial shifts in community composition. Extending the duration of the experiment could provide deeper insights into how nutrient limitations and other environmental factors further influence the diversity and specialization of microbial taxa in the rhizosphere. Further ecologically functional prediction using FAPROTAX showed that the fertilizer induced a specific rhizosphere microbial profile characterized by specialist ASVs possessing various functional traits related to N cycling and other ecological processes. In terms of N metabolism, the fertilizer displayed a significant enrichment in processes associated with nitrate respiration, nitrate reduction, and nitrate denitrification (Fig. S8). The increased abundance of these functional traits suggested an elevated capacity for N transformation via specialist taxa within the rhizosphere microbial community under fertilizer application ( Wang et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2023 ), aligning with the overall ecologically functional prediction discussed earlier. In contrast, the more specialized cellulolytic capacity enriched by MetG2 indicated a niche specialization associated with the degradation of plant polysaccharides. This implied that MetG2 possessed the enzymatic machinery necessary for breaking down complex plant-derived carbohydrates, potentially facilitating the release of carbon sources to support the growth and metabolic activities of specialist microbial taxa ( Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ). Similarly, the prevalence of xylanolytic and ureolytic specialists under OG10 might enhance the mineralization of organic nutrients locked in plant residues and waste products. Bacteria with xylanolytic enzymes can hydrolyze xylan into simpler sugars like xylose, which can then be taken up by plants or utilized by other soil microbes ( Bhardwaj et al., 2019 ). Meanwhile, ureolytic bacteria can break down urea, releasing ammonium ions – a readily usable form of nitrogen for plants ( Jin et al., 2017 ). The distinct predicted ecologically functional profiles conferred by inoculations demonstrated that SynComs could steer selection toward desired microbial services in a composition-dependent way. However, these predictions were based on taxonomic affiliations and require validation through high-resolution techniques such as shotgun metagenomics or functional gene analysis. Overall, linking specialist composition with predicted ecological roles provides insights into inoculant effects on rhizosphere functional diversity. This can guide synthetic community design for targeted enrichment of microbial functions supporting plant productivity. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the multifaceted and context-dependent effects of SynComs on the sugarcane rhizosphere community. While no significant differences in α-diversity were observed, significant differences in β-diversity were identified, along with distinctive patterns in temporal dynamics, specialist/generalist taxa, and community assembly processes among different SynComs. Among the SynComs tested, MetG2 exhibited the most consistent positive effects on sugarcane growth, making it the most suitable candidate for sugarcane cultivation in this study. MetG2 had the fewest number of declining ASVs , indicating good synergy with the native microbial community by promoting beneficial interactions over competitive exclusion and enhancing the overall functionality of the microbial community. Future research should focus on investigating the links between community dynamics and plant growth promotion in diverse agricultural and environmental contexts. This knowledge will contribute to the development of sustainable and efficient strategies for harnessing the potential of microbial communities in enhancing crop productivity.
