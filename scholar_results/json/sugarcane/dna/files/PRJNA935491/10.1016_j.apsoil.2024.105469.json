    "full_text": "Increasing evidence suggests that microbes colonizing both above- and below-ground parts of plants are critical for plant growth and agricultural productivity. However, the extent to which the interactions between above- and below-ground microbial communities affect microbial colonization and plant performance is not fully understood. To address this question, we performed a phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment (MT-Exp) using sugarcane, followed by microbiome profiling with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Plant phenotypic observation exhibited that transplanting field-grown sugarcane phyllosphere and/or rhizosphere onto sugarcane plantlets in a controlled growth condition significantly increased total biomass compared to un-transplanted plants. Notably, co-transplantation of phyllosphere (P) and rhizosphere (R) microbiomes (PR treatment) resulted in the most pronounced plant growth promotion. A comparison of alpha diversity revealed that microbiome transplantation enhanced the species richness of both phyllosphere and rhizosphere communities. Additionally, PERMANOVA results showed that microbiome transplantation strongly impacted the rhizosphere microbial community, while no significant differences were observed in the phyllosphere microbes. The PR treatment was found to be more effective in introducing a greater diversity of microbial taxa than single transplantation (P and R treatments), of which many of these transplanted taxa were recognized as plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). Furthermore, the PR network displayed denser connectivity between above- and below-ground components compared to all other treatments. In conclusion, our findings highlight the interdependence of above-ground and below-ground microorganisms, demonstrating their indispensable role in colonizing and promoting sugarcane growth."

        "paragraphs": [
          "The plant kingdom hosts a wide array of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, forming the intricate ecosystem known as the plant microbiome ( Turner et al., 2013 ). The association between plants and microbes dates back to the initial colonization of the earth by ancestral plant lineages hundreds of millions of years ago ( Hassani et al., 2018 ). Over time, these relationships have influenced the evolution of both plant and microbial partners, resulting in the formation of the plant holobiont ( Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2016 ). The plant holobiont refers to the concept that plants are not isolated organisms but rather complex systems composed of multiple interdependent components, including the plant itself, its associated microbes, and the surrounding environment. It is well established that the plant and some of its associated microbes engage in a symbiotic relationship, where both cohorts rely on each other for survival and growth ( Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015 ; Hassani et al., 2018 ). Selective pressure on the components of the plant holobiont drives the composition and structure of the plant microbiome, leading to the selection of host-preferred microbes that play a crucial role in the overall health and fitness of the plant ( Bordenstein and Theis, 2015 ; Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015 ; Hassani et al., 2018 ).",
          "Plants rely on a complex network of interactions with microorganisms occurring above- and below-ground to survive and thrive ( Nadarajah and Abdul Rahman, 2021 ). Above-ground interactions refer to those that take place on the above-ground plant surface, such as leaves, stems, and flowers, collectively known as phyllosphere microbiome ( Vorholt, 2012 ), while below-ground interactions occur in the soil surrounding plant roots, also defined as rhizosphere microbiome ( Berendsen et al., 2012 ). Each of these compartments is unique regarding environmental conditions and microbial interactions. Moreover, phyllosphere and rhizosphere microorganisms can influence host plants in different modes, including beneficial, detrimental, or neutral. Beneficial microorganisms in these two habitats can provide numerous benefits to host plants, such as improving nutrient uptake ( van der Heijden et al., 2016 ), protecting against pathogens and herbivores ( Elhady et al., 2018 ; Friman et al., 2021 ), inducing plant innate immunity ( Van der Ent et al., 2009 ) and systemic resistance (ISR) ( Zamioudis et al., 2015 ), enhancing abiotic stress tolerance ( Vurukonda et al., 2016 ), and regulating plant growth and development ( Ort√≠z-Castro et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, detrimental microorganisms can cause plant diseases and thus reduce plant growth and yield. Therefore, the study of above- and below-ground microbial interactions holds great promise in delivering crucial new understandings regarding the influence of microbial diversity on plant growth and productivity.",
          "Several studies using the whole microbiome transplantation method have suggested that below-ground microbial communities could affect the above-ground plant compartment and its microbial residents. For instance, Wagner et al. (2014) , Panke-Buisse et al. (2015) , Panke-Buisse et al. (2017) , and Lu et al. (2018) have shown that transplanting soil and rhizosphere microbiota could influence the above-ground plant phenotypes. Other experiments have also revealed that below-ground microbial communities play an essential role in battling disease infection and suppressing herbivorous insects in above-ground plant tissues ( Yuan et al., 2018 ; Pineda et al., 2020 ). This implies a close association between above- and below-ground microbial communities in promoting their host growth and development. However, the abovementioned studies solely focused on transplanting below-ground microbiota, yet there is no study so far that examined the efficacy of co-transplantation of above- and below-ground microbiota in a single individual plant, especially in terms of the success rate of colonization and host performance.",
          "Sugarcane ( Saccharum sp.) is one of the most valuable vegetatively propagated crops, cultivated in 28.19 million hectares in at least 106 countries spread across the tropics, semi-subtropics, and subtropics ( FAOSTAT, 2019 ). Commercial sugarcane cultivation, however, faces numerous biotic and abiotic challenges in optimizing crop production. Current strategies relying on excessive chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides often have catastrophic and unsustainable consequences. For instance, the high-rate use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer can have negative impacts on human well-being, the environment, and long-term soil quality and health, such as soil, water, air, and food contaminations, ozone depletion, and eutrophication ( Ahmed et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Anas et al., 2020 ; Balasuriya et al., 2022 ). Therefore, equilibrating sugarcane productivity with sustainability, which is environmentally friendly and should meet the food demands of the ever-increasing global population, is warranted. In addition, given its economic importance and challenges, the potential to apply sugarcane-associated microbiota as an alternative to agrochemicals has become a topic of interest in recent decades ( Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al., 2014 ; Armanhi et al., 2018 ; Singh et al., 2021 ).",
          "In this study, we aimed to explore the significance of interactions between the above- and below-ground microbial communities in robust plant colonization and performance. For this purpose, we used sugarcane and conducted a phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment (which is further referred to as MT-Exp) in a controlled growth environment. We then observed the total plant biomass and analyzed the microbiomes of the above- and below-ground plant compartments by sequencing the microbial 16S rRNA gene. We hypothesized that plants play an active role in selecting the preferred microbes in both the above- and below-ground parts, which could impact the colonization process of inoculated microbes."

The leaves and rhizosphere of the same plant were sampled, and this process was replicated for five additional individual plants ( n =¬†5 replicates). Rhizosphere samples were obtained from the soil that remained attached to the roots after the roots were vigorously shaken by hand ( Hamonts et al., 2018 ). For leaf samples, leaf numbers +1 to +4 were selected, and the sites near the leaf sheath and tip were removed using a surface-sterilized scissor ( de Souza et al., 2016 ). All samples were then stored in a sterile container and kept cool during field collection and transportation at 4¬†¬∞C and frozen at ‚àí80¬†¬∞C until used for downstream steps."

Briefly, a total of 25¬†g of pooled leaves from five samples (5¬†g per sample) were suspended with 500¬†ml of sterile water and blended for approximately 5¬†min. The resulting leaf slurry containing microbial endophytes and epiphytes was filtered using nine layers of autoclaved gauze pad to remove big leaf particles. The foliar spray was performed with a plastic hand sprayer. Particularly, phyllosphere microbes were transplanted by directly spraying approximately 5¬†ml of the leaf slurry onto the plantlet leaves. Rhizosphere microbiome transplantation was conducted following the method implemented by Lu et al. (2018) with some modifications as follows. A total of 5¬†g of roots were transferred to a 50¬†ml falcon tube containing 45¬†ml of sterile water and then shaken vigorously for 10¬†min on an orbital shaker. Following root removal, the solution from each sample ( n =¬†5 replicates) was pooled and combined in a 500¬†ml Erlenmeyer flask. The rhizosphere microbiome solution was then applied by pouring onto the surface of the potting media, approximately 15¬†ml per plantlet. To improve the efficacy of any potential plant growth-promoting activity from microbiome transplantations, plantlets were inoculated once a week for three weeks.",

Plantlets were maintained at room temperature (around 25‚Äì30¬†¬∞C) under white-fluorescent light with a 16:8-h light-to-dark cycle for 75¬†days after the first application of microbiome transplantation. Furthermore, plants were kept well-watered with 25¬†ml of sterile distilled water every three days.",
              "The experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates. Three different transplantation treatments with the phyllosphere microbiome (P), rhizosphere microbiome (R), and a co-transplantation of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes (PR) were performed. In addition, control plants (C) were inoculated with sterile distilled water. At the end of the experiment, total plant biomass (i.e., root, stem, and leaf) was measured, and triplicates of rhizosphere and phyllosphere samples in each treatment were collected following the above procedure ( 2.1 Sample collection for microbiome sources ) and frozen at ‚àí80¬†¬∞C for further steps."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Several studies have already discussed how important microbial diversity is for plant growth and productivity in the agroecosystem (reviewed by ( Gupta et al., 2021 ; Kaul et al., 2021 ; Santos and Olivares, 2021 )). Although single isolates or synthetic microbial consortia have been described to confer beneficial traits to stimulate plant growth and development ( Armanhi et al., 2018 ; Yin et al., 2022 ; Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ), only a few works evaluated the positive influence of the whole phyllosphere and/or rhizosphere microbiome transplantation on plant growth stimulation and the proportion of survival taxa in the new host environment ( Zahn and Amend, 2017 ; Lu et al., 2018 ; Morella et al., 2020 ; Jiang et al., 2022a ). In this study, a phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment (MT-Exp) using sugarcane plantlets as the host plant combined with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was carried out to dissect the important role of above- and below-ground microbial interactions for robust plant colonization and growth promotion. The microbial sources used in the MT-Exp were collected from an organic sugarcane farm, as we have previously shown that the organic practice hosted a vast diversity of the microbial community and PGPB as microbial signatures ( Khoiri et al., 2021 ). Our result exhibited that either single or co-transplantation of both phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes from sugarcane cultivated in farm soil to sugarcane plantlets grown in a pot significantly enhanced plant growth as observed from the total biomass. We also demonstrated that co-transplantation of both the above- and below-ground microbial communities of a single individual plant increased the number of successfully transplanted taxa that might importantly contribute to the observed growth enhancement of the recipient plants.",
          "The alpha diversity analysis revealed that transplanting only the phyllosphere microbiome significantly increased the species richness of the phyllosphere community in recipient plants compared to un-transplanted plants (C and R treatment). A similar effect was also observed in the rhizosphere community, where plants that did not receive rhizosphere microbiome transplantation (C and P treatment) exhibited significantly lower rhizosphere microbial richness. In contrast, co-transplantation did not yield significantly different species richness indices for phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbial communities compared to single transplantations (P and R treatments). These findings suggested that both transplantation methods exerted a comparable influence on microbial alpha diversity for above- and below-ground plant compartments. Furthermore, correlation analysis demonstrated a positive relationship between species richness of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbial communities and the total plant biomass. Therefore, the increase in species richness in response to microbiome transplantation resulted in beneficial impacts on the growth and development of the host plants, as reported in previous studies ( Laforest-Lapointe et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2022 ). In short, whether single or co-transplant, microbiome transplantation positively influenced microbial alpha diversity in both above- and below-ground plant compartments and potentially enhanced plant growth and development.",
          "The ability of microbial inoculants to colonize and thrive on the target host is one of the most important factors in determining the efficacy of microbial-based biofertilizers ( Finkel et al., 2017 ; Romano et al., 2020 ). In this study, the number of successfully transplanted taxa in both plant compartments could be applied as an indicator of successful transplantation. The highest number was detected in the PR treatment, indicating the microbial inoculants' survivability from co-transplantation of both phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes on the recipient host plants. It also implied that phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbial communities are interconnected with each other. The potential communications between the two microbial communities are likely to be mediated by phytohormonal and metabolic responses, such as leaf and root exudations. For instance, a previous study has shown that Arabidopsis thaliana changed their root exudate profiles to alter the composition and recruit beneficial rhizosphere microbiota in response to foliar pathogen infection ( Yuan et al., 2018 ). Another work demonstrated that inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to soil could modify milkweed's foliar cardenolide concentration and composition, a toxic compound used to defend against herbivores ( Vannette et al., 2013 ). It was also noticed that, regardless of the transplantation methods, the numbers of transplanted taxa observed in the phyllosphere were much lower than those in the rhizosphere. It might be due to the characteristics of the phyllosphere habitat, which is considered a harsh environment with limited nutrient availability compared to other parts of the plant, such as the root, rhizosphere, and soil ( Vorholt, 2012 ). Consequently, this condition could have a significant impact on the composition and diversity of the phyllosphere microbiome and restrict the success of phyllosphere microbiome transplantation ( Mercier and Lindow, 2000 ; Vorholt, 2012 ; Chaudhry et al., 2020 ). In addition, the efficacy of bacterial transfer onto the phyllosphere might have been affected by environmental conditions such as humidity during the spraying process ( Morella et al., 2020 ). This could be the reason for no significant difference found in the beta diversity of phyllosphere microbes ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ), as a few numbers of transplanted taxa might not be able to change the overall community profile. On the opposite, a higher portion of transplanted rhizosphere microbes could have a strong influence on the rhizosphere community profile, as evidenced by the separation of the samples according to treatments on the PCoA plot ( Fig. 4 ) and the statistical significance of the PERMANOVA test ( Table 1 ). Furthermore, among these transplanted taxa, Proteobacteria was the most predominant transplanted bacterial phylum in the rhizosphere habitat as well as the topmost abundant phylum in all MT-Exp samples ( Fig. 2 ). This finding is in line with the previous rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment on tomato plants, revealing that a vast diversity of total- and core-transplanted taxa belonged to Proteobacteria ( Jiang et al., 2022a ). Taken together, co-transplantation of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes shows promise for enhancing microbial inoculant survivability and influencing plant-microbe interactions. However, challenges persist in effectively colonizing the phyllosphere and understanding its complex dynamics.",
          "We previously identified one of the microbial signatures of organic sugarcane phyllosphere belonging to the genus Bacillus ( Khoiri et al., 2021 ). In the present study, we found that an ASV taxonomically assigned as [P] B17948- Bacillus was successfully transplanted to leaves of recipient plants via both single and co-transplantation methods (P and PR treatments), implying that the microbial signatures could be transferable. Other bacterial genera that are commonly known to have plant growth-promoting activities were also discovered to be parts of transplanted taxa in the rhizosphere of recipient plants (R and PR treatments), including Arthrobacter ( Jiang et al., 2022b ) , Bacillus ( Yuan et al., 2013 ) , Bradyrhizobium ( Rodrigues et al., 2013 ) , Burkholderia ( Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al., 2014 ) , Mesorhizobium ( Laranjo et al., 2014 ) , Methylobacterium ( Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ) , Paenibacillus ( Liu et al., 2021 ) , Pseudomonas ( Singh et al., 2021 ) , Rhizobium ( Wdowiak-Wr√≥bel et al., 2017 ) , Sphingomonas ( Wang et al., 2020 ) , and Streptomyces ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Altogether, these transplanted PGPB might contribute to the growth stimulation of the recipient plants when compared to the un-transplanted plants.",
          "Microbiome co-occurrence network was further performed to analyze the impact of microbiome transplantation and the potential roles of the transplanted taxa on the interactions between above- and below-ground microbial communities. The analysis results showed that PR treatment had the highest number of nodes and connections, indicating that the co-transplantation of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes might facilitate the preservation of essential connections among microbes inhabiting above- and below-ground compartments. It has been recognized that preserving original microbe-microbe interactions could considerably increase microbial survival and maintain functional traits that they carry out ( Nichols et al., 2010 ; de Souza et al., 2020 ). As expected, the control plants displayed the lowest network connectivity, as they should be nearly sterile and likely harbored only a few random microbes. Moreover, several transplanted taxa were also identified as the hub node in the network. For instance, in the P network, 1 out of 3 hubs was the transplanted taxa, taxonomically assigned as [P] B17818- Bacteroides . Bacteroides were reported to have the ability to utilize plant polysaccharides, as well as oligosaccharides derived from plant cell walls ( Van Laere et al., 2000 ). [R] B02146-Acetobacteraceae was the hub and transplanted taxa in the R network. Many members of the family Acetobacteraceae were known as bacteria that fix nitrogen, capable of promoting plant growth through several mechanisms ( Reis and Teixeira, 2015 ). Meanwhile, the PR network had the greatest number of hub nodes, and 2 of them were transplanted taxa taxonomically assigned as [P] B15940-Micrococcaceae and [R] B12427- Fimbriiglobus . Numerous taxa belonging to the family Micrococcaceae were found to participate in the biodegradation of environmental pollutants ( Dastager et al., 2014 ), while Fimbriiglobus had a chitinolytic capability ( Ravin et al., 2018 ). Interestingly, [R] B12427- Fimbriiglobus had a strong positive correlation with another PGPB, i.e., [P] B03194- Methylobacterium, which was also identified as the hub in the PR network. Similarly, [P] B17818- Bacteroides also displayed a positive association with a PGPB, i.e., [R] B04078- Devosia , in the P network. These results implied that transplanted taxa might serve as a central hub and interact with other beneficial bacteria in the community to promote plant growth. Collectively, this finding suggested that above- and below-ground microbial interactions might play an important role in the colonization of the target host, and the transplanted taxa might act as the key in this inter-compartment networking. However, the molecular mechanism of how above- and below-ground microbial communities communicate with each other remains elusive, and future studies are required.",
          "One limitation of this study is the focus on bacterial communities, with limited consideration given to other potentially important microbial groups such as fungi and rare bacteria. These microbes could still play significant roles in plant health and ecosystem dynamics. While efforts were made to optimize transplantation techniques, including considerations for humidity levels, future studies could benefit from more detailed methodologies to enhance bacterial transfer onto plant surfaces. It is important to note that the lack of successful bacterial transfer onto the leaves compared to rhizosphere microbes in this study does not diminish the potential importance of the phyllosphere community in plant health and development. Addressing these limitations in future research endeavors would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of microbial transplantation dynamics and their implications for plant-microbe interactions."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction The plant kingdom hosts a wide array of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, forming the intricate ecosystem known as the plant microbiome ( Turner et al., 2013 ). The association between plants and microbes dates back to the initial colonization of the earth by ancestral plant lineages hundreds of millions of years ago ( Hassani et al., 2018 ). Over time, these relationships have influenced the evolution of both plant and microbial partners, resulting in the formation of the plant holobiont ( Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2016 ). The plant holobiont refers to the concept that plants are not isolated organisms but rather complex systems composed of multiple interdependent components, including the plant itself, its associated microbes, and the surrounding environment. It is well established that the plant and some of its associated microbes engage in a symbiotic relationship, where both cohorts rely on each other for survival and growth ( Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015 ; Hassani et al., 2018 ). Selective pressure on the components of the plant holobiont drives the composition and structure of the plant microbiome, leading to the selection of host-preferred microbes that play a crucial role in the overall health and fitness of the plant ( Bordenstein and Theis, 2015 ; Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015 ; Hassani et al., 2018 ). Plants rely on a complex network of interactions with microorganisms occurring above- and below-ground to survive and thrive ( Nadarajah and Abdul Rahman, 2021 ). Above-ground interactions refer to those that take place on the above-ground plant surface, such as leaves, stems, and flowers, collectively known as phyllosphere microbiome ( Vorholt, 2012 ), while below-ground interactions occur in the soil surrounding plant roots, also defined as rhizosphere microbiome ( Berendsen et al., 2012 ). Each of these compartments is unique regarding environmental conditions and microbial interactions. Moreover, phyllosphere and rhizosphere microorganisms can influence host plants in different modes, including beneficial, detrimental, or neutral. Beneficial microorganisms in these two habitats can provide numerous benefits to host plants, such as improving nutrient uptake ( van der Heijden et al., 2016 ), protecting against pathogens and herbivores ( Elhady et al., 2018 ; Friman et al., 2021 ), inducing plant innate immunity ( Van der Ent et al., 2009 ) and systemic resistance (ISR) ( Zamioudis et al., 2015 ), enhancing abiotic stress tolerance ( Vurukonda et al., 2016 ), and regulating plant growth and development ( Ort√≠z-Castro et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, detrimental microorganisms can cause plant diseases and thus reduce plant growth and yield. Therefore, the study of above- and below-ground microbial interactions holds great promise in delivering crucial new understandings regarding the influence of microbial diversity on plant growth and productivity. Several studies using the whole microbiome transplantation method have suggested that below-ground microbial communities could affect the above-ground plant compartment and its microbial residents. For instance, Wagner et al. (2014) , Panke-Buisse et al. (2015) , Panke-Buisse et al. (2017) , and Lu et al. (2018) have shown that transplanting soil and rhizosphere microbiota could influence the above-ground plant phenotypes. Other experiments have also revealed that below-ground microbial communities play an essential role in battling disease infection and suppressing herbivorous insects in above-ground plant tissues ( Yuan et al., 2018 ; Pineda et al., 2020 ). This implies a close association between above- and below-ground microbial communities in promoting their host growth and development. However, the abovementioned studies solely focused on transplanting below-ground microbiota, yet there is no study so far that examined the efficacy of co-transplantation of above- and below-ground microbiota in a single individual plant, especially in terms of the success rate of colonization and host performance. Sugarcane ( Saccharum sp.) is one of the most valuable vegetatively propagated crops, cultivated in 28.19 million hectares in at least 106 countries spread across the tropics, semi-subtropics, and subtropics ( FAOSTAT, 2019 ). Commercial sugarcane cultivation, however, faces numerous biotic and abiotic challenges in optimizing crop production. Current strategies relying on excessive chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides often have catastrophic and unsustainable consequences. For instance, the high-rate use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer can have negative impacts on human well-being, the environment, and long-term soil quality and health, such as soil, water, air, and food contaminations, ozone depletion, and eutrophication ( Ahmed et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Anas et al., 2020 ; Balasuriya et al., 2022 ). Therefore, equilibrating sugarcane productivity with sustainability, which is environmentally friendly and should meet the food demands of the ever-increasing global population, is warranted. In addition, given its economic importance and challenges, the potential to apply sugarcane-associated microbiota as an alternative to agrochemicals has become a topic of interest in recent decades ( Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al., 2014 ; Armanhi et al., 2018 ; Singh et al., 2021 ). In this study, we aimed to explore the significance of interactions between the above- and below-ground microbial communities in robust plant colonization and performance. For this purpose, we used sugarcane and conducted a phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment (which is further referred to as MT-Exp) in a controlled growth environment. We then observed the total plant biomass and analyzed the microbiomes of the above- and below-ground plant compartments by sequencing the microbial 16S rRNA gene. We hypothesized that plants play an active role in selecting the preferred microbes in both the above- and below-ground parts, which could impact the colonization process of inoculated microbes. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sample collection for microbiome sources The microbial donors used for the phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment (MT-Exp) were derived from the leaves and rhizosphere of sugarcane plants collected from an organic farm at Rai Sukphoang, Chom Bueng District, Ratchaburi, Thailand (13¬∞35‚Ä≤42.5‚Ä≥N 99¬∞34‚Ä≤58.0‚Ä≥E). The leaves and rhizosphere of the same plant were sampled, and this process was replicated for five additional individual plants ( n =¬†5 replicates). Rhizosphere samples were obtained from the soil that remained attached to the roots after the roots were vigorously shaken by hand ( Hamonts et al., 2018 ). For leaf samples, leaf numbers +1 to +4 were selected, and the sites near the leaf sheath and tip were removed using a surface-sterilized scissor ( de Souza et al., 2016 ). All samples were then stored in a sterile container and kept cool during field collection and transportation at 4¬†¬∞C and frozen at ‚àí80¬†¬∞C until used for downstream steps. 2.2 Phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment (MT-Exp) Phyllosphere microbiome transplantation was carried out following the method described by Zahn and Amend (2017) . Briefly, a total of 25¬†g of pooled leaves from five samples (5¬†g per sample) were suspended with 500¬†ml of sterile water and blended for approximately 5¬†min. The resulting leaf slurry containing microbial endophytes and epiphytes was filtered using nine layers of autoclaved gauze pad to remove big leaf particles. The foliar spray was performed with a plastic hand sprayer. Particularly, phyllosphere microbes were transplanted by directly spraying approximately 5¬†ml of the leaf slurry onto the plantlet leaves. Rhizosphere microbiome transplantation was conducted following the method implemented by Lu et al. (2018) with some modifications as follows. A total of 5¬†g of roots were transferred to a 50¬†ml falcon tube containing 45¬†ml of sterile water and then shaken vigorously for 10¬†min on an orbital shaker. Following root removal, the solution from each sample ( n =¬†5 replicates) was pooled and combined in a 500¬†ml Erlenmeyer flask. The rhizosphere microbiome solution was then applied by pouring onto the surface of the potting media, approximately 15¬†ml per plantlet. To improve the efficacy of any potential plant growth-promoting activity from microbiome transplantations, plantlets were inoculated once a week for three weeks. A total of 16 sugarcane plantlets (Thai sugarcane Suphanburi 50 variety) derived from tissue cultures were grown on a small plastic pot (8¬†cm top diameter, 6¬†cm bottom diameter, 7¬†cm height) containing 51¬†g of autoclaved peat moss. Plantlets were maintained at room temperature (around 25‚Äì30¬†¬∞C) under white-fluorescent light with a 16:8-h light-to-dark cycle for 75¬†days after the first application of microbiome transplantation. Furthermore, plants were kept well-watered with 25¬†ml of sterile distilled water every three days. The experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates. Three different transplantation treatments with the phyllosphere microbiome (P), rhizosphere microbiome (R), and a co-transplantation of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes (PR) were performed. In addition, control plants (C) were inoculated with sterile distilled water. At the end of the experiment, total plant biomass (i.e., root, stem, and leaf) was measured, and triplicates of rhizosphere and phyllosphere samples in each treatment were collected following the above procedure ( 2.1 Sample collection for microbiome sources ) and frozen at ‚àí80¬†¬∞C for further steps. 2.3 DNA extraction Sugarcane leaves collected from both farm and MT-Exp were ground using mortars and pestles, assisted by the application of liquid nitrogen. Phyllosphere microbial DNA was then extracted from the resulting powder using the innuPREP Plant DNA Kit (Analytik Jena AG, Berlin, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the rhizosphere, a DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) was utilized. Briefly, the frozen rhizosphere samples were defrosted and suspended in a beading buffer. The microbial DNA was then extracted according to the company's protocol without any modification. Finally, all DNA samples were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated with 1¬†% gel electrophoresis and nanodrop, respectively, and stored at ‚àí80¬†¬∞C until used for subsequent steps. 2.4 DNA sequencing A DNA library for each sample was prepared through a two-step PCR amplification protocol. The hypervariable region V4 of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene was targeted for amplification with the paired primers 515F (5‚Äô-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3‚Ä≤) and 806R (5‚Äô-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3‚Ä≤). The resulting amplicon libraries were subjected to sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 2¬†√ó¬†250¬†bp paired-end sequencing platform (Illumina, United States). The entire process of library preparation and DNA sequencing was carried out by the Genome Quebec Innovation Centre at McGill University, Canada. Raw sequence reads were deposited to NCBI SRA with accession numbers SRR23491680 - SRR23491713 under the BioProject accession number PRJNA935491. 2.5 Amplicon data processing The quality of Illumina raw reads was checked using FastQC v.0.11.9 ( Andrews, 2010 ). Subsequently, the amplicon data processing was performed with Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2 v.2022.8) ( Bolyen et al., 2019 ). Briefly, paired-end reads were filtered, denoised, dereplicated, and merged using DADA2 v.1.22.0 ( Callahan et al., 2016 ), which generates amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The taxonomy of each ASV was assigned with the SILVA 138 database using a scikit-learn naive Bayes machine-learning classifier. The ASV classified as either chloroplast or mitochondria was filtered out from the dataset. Furthermore, the alpha-rarefaction curve was drawn to determine the optimum sampling depth for rarefying-based data normalization. 2.6 Diversity analysis To estimate the diversity in a sample (alpha diversity), a non-parametric Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test was performed using the Faith phylogenetic distance (Faith PD) index. Estimated species richness was then correlated with observed plant biomass using Spearman correlation. Microbial diversity between samples (beta diversity) was calculated based on Bray‚ÄìCurtis' distance and represented with a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot. Furthermore, the permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices (PERMANOVA) test with 999 permutations was used to assess the statistical significance of beta diversity, followed by the BETADISPER test to check the assumption of variance homogeneity between groups. All diversity analyses were carried out in R v.4.2.2 ( R Core Team, 2022 ) using R packages phyloseq v.1.40.0 ( McMurdie and Holmes, 2013 ) with the rarefy_even_depth, ordinate, and plot_ordination functions, vegan v.2.6.4 ( Oksanen et al., 2019 ) with the adonis2 and betadisper functions, and ggplot2 v.3.4.0 ( Wickham, 2016 ) with the ggplot function for visualization. 2.7 Identification of successfully transplanted taxa To determine the number of bacterial ASVs that have the capability to colonize the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of recipient sugarcane plantlets, the origin of the ASV observed in the samples was tracked using the following criteria. An ASV in each treatment group (P, R, PR) was defined as a ‚Äútransplanted taxa‚Äù if it was (i) detected in at least 50¬†% of all sample replicates ( n =¬†3) and (ii) originated from the sugarcane farm (microbiome source) rather than the control with a probability score¬†>¬†0.9. The probability score was calculated following the method applied in the SourceTracker program ( Knights et al., 2011 ) with some modifications. Briefly, farm and control samples were defined as two microbial sources and recipient plants as the sink. If the probability of detecting an ASV was higher in control (> 0.1), it was assumed that the ASV might be a common taxon or derived from other sources rather than from the farm; thus, it was not considered as the ‚Äútransplanted taxa.‚Äù Each ASV was tracked one by one without the need to perform Gibbs sampling. The identification of transplanted taxa was carried out using an in-house script in R v.4.2.2 ( R Core Team, 2022 ), and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NuruddinKhoiry/Plant_microbiome_transplantation . 2.8 Co-occurrence network analysis Treatment-specific microbial co-occurrence networks were analyzed using the SparCC algorithm ( Friedman and Alm, 2012 ) as implemented in FastSpar v.1.0.0 ( Watts et al., 2018 ). To construct co-occurrence networks, only strong ( r >¬†0.8 or r <¬†‚àí0.8) and significant ( p <¬†0.01) correlations after Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction were selected. Cytoscape v.3.9.1 ( Shannon et al., 2003 ) was used to visualize the generated microbial network. The properties of the network were estimated using the Network Analyzer v.4.4.8 plugin ( Assenov et al., 2008 ). In addition, nodes with connections (node degree)¬†>¬†4 were considered the hub in the network. 2.9 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the measured plant phenotypic data was performed using R v.4.2.2 ( R Core Team, 2022 ). Prior to statistical analysis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Leven tests were used to assess the normality and homoscedasticity of the data, respectively. Subsequently, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out, followed by the application of the Least Significant Difference (LSD) to compare the differences between treatments with a 95¬†% confidence level using the R package agricolae v.1.3.5 ( Mendiburu and Yaseen, 2020 ). 3 Results 3.1 Microbiome transplantation increased sugarcane biomass To evaluate the effect of microbiome transplantation on sugarcane growth, the total biomass of each plant was measured at the end of the pot experiment (75¬†days after the first application of microbiome transplantation). As shown in Fig. 1 , the total plant biomass was significantly influenced by microbiome transplantation (ANOVA; p <¬†0.05). All transplanted plants had significantly higher biomass than the control (LSD; p <¬†0.05). Of these, the PR treatment had the highest plant biomass and was statistically greater than the C and P treatment (LSD; p <¬†0.05) while not significantly different than the R treatment (LSD; p >¬†0.05). 3.2 General information on amplicon data To describe the above- and below-ground microbial profiles of sugarcane plants after the whole microbiome transplantation, amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. A total of 22,921,622 paired-end reads were generated from 34 overall samples. The 16S rRNA dataset had an average of 674,165 reads with a mean sequence length of 250 bases per sample. These sequence reads were further filtered and denoised to produce 20,418 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). After removing ASV assigned as chloroplast and mitochondria and normalizing data using the rarefying method, the remaining ASVs were 386 and 7389 for the total phyllosphere and rhizosphere samples, respectively (samples from the farm were not included in this quantification). As shown in the alpha rarefaction curve (Fig. S1), the difference in the maximum number of reads between phyllosphere and rhizosphere samples was up to 14√ó. It was also noticed that the observed ASVs from the sugarcane farm for original microbiome transplantation were much higher than those in the microbiome transplantation experiment (MT-Exp), regardless of the sequencing depth (Fig. S1). Thus, in this study, farm samples were only used for baseline and were not used for further comparison, and the rarefying normalization was only performed for the samples collected from the MT-Exp prior diversity analysis. Specifically, the MT-Exp datasets were subsampled to 5300 and 250,000 reads per sample for the phyllosphere and rhizosphere, respectively. In addition, Good's coverage calculation of all MT-Exp samples after rarefying showed an average value of 99.93¬†% ( Table S1 ), indicating an adequate sample size for downstream steps. To describe the above- and below-ground microbial profiles of sugarcane plants after the whole microbiome transplantation, amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform.

It was also noticed that the observed ASVs from the sugarcane farm for original microbiome transplantation were much higher than those in the microbiome transplantation experiment (MT-Exp), regardless of the sequencing depth (Fig. S1). Thus, in this study, farm samples were only used for baseline and were not used for further comparison, and the rarefying normalization was only performed for the samples collected from the MT-Exp prior diversity analysis. Specifically, the MT-Exp datasets were subsampled to 5300 and 250,000 reads per sample for the phyllosphere and rhizosphere, respectively. In addition, Good's coverage calculation of all MT-Exp samples after rarefying showed an average value of 99.93¬†% (Table S1), indicating an adequate sample size for downstream steps. 3.3 Phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiome composition The composition of the phyllosphere microbial community at the phylum level revealed that Proteobacteria was the most predominant bacterial phylum in all treatments, accounting for 93.4¬†%, 86.5¬†%, 90.0¬†%, and 45.4¬†% in C, P, R, and PR treatments, respectively ( Fig. 2 A ). Likewise, Proteobacteria was also found to be the most abundant phylum colonizing sugarcane rhizosphere with an average relative abundance of 27.6¬†% across all samples, followed by Planctomycetota (16.6¬†%), Actinobacteriota (11.4¬†%), Firmicutes (10.2¬†%), Chloroflexi (6.6¬†%), Acidobacteriota (6.4¬†%), Verrucomicrobiota (6.0¬†%), Bacteroidota (5.4¬†%), Myxococcota (2.8¬†%), Bdellovibrionota (2.5¬†%), Gemmatimonadota (1.2¬†%), and other phyla with relative abundances <1¬†% ( Fig. 2 A). At the genus level, the topmost abundant genera in the phyllosphere samples were generally unassigned taxa that could not be classified lower than phylum and class levels, including unassigned Proteobacteria in C and P treatment and unassigned Alphaproteobacteria in R treatment ( Fig. 2 B). On the opposite, PR treatment was dominated by Acinetobacter (14.2¬†%) and Prevotella (11¬†%) ( Fig. 2 B). For rhizosphere samples, Bacillus was the predominant bacterial genera in overall samples (20.16¬†%), followed by unassigned Vicinamibacterales (19.29¬†%), unassigned Pirellulaceae (13.81¬†%), JG30-KF-CM45 (11.36¬†%), Planctomicrobium (10.15¬†%), Devosia (10.05¬†%), Gemmata (9.76¬†%), and other genera with relative abundances <9¬†% ( Fig. 2 B). 3.4 Microbiome transplantation increased species richness of both above- and below-ground microbial communities Alpha diversity calculation at the ASV level using Kruskal‚ÄìWallis revealed that microbiome transplantation significantly affected the species richness of both phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbial communities ( p <¬†0.05). More specifically, the P treatment had the highest Faith PD score of phyllosphere microbes and was significantly higher than C and R treatment ( Fig. 3 A ). For rhizosphere microbes, species richness of R and PR treatments were significantly greater than C and P treatment ( Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis showed positive correlations between species richness (Faith PD) and total plant biomass for both phyllosphere ( r =¬†0.04, p >¬†0.05) and rhizosphere ( r =¬†0.62, p <¬†0.05) microbial communities. 3.5 Microbiome transplantation induced a distinct rhizosphere microbial profile but not the phyllosphere Unconstrained principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) using the Bray‚ÄìCurtis' distance matrix revealed that less dissimilarity of microbial beta diversity could be elucidated for the phyllosphere ( Fig. 4 A ). On the opposite, rhizosphere samples were clustered based on treatment with 27.8¬†% and 13.8¬†% of variations explained in the first and second axes of the PCoA plot, respectively ( Fig. 4 B). PERMANOVA analysis indicated that the treatment had a strong effect on the rhizosphere community ( R 2 =¬†0.44, p <¬†0.05) ( Table 1 ), while no significant test was found for the phyllosphere ( R 2 =¬†0.34, p >¬†0.05) ( Table 1 ). Furthermore, an insignificant result of the BETADISPER test confirmed that the difference in rhizosphere beta diversity was due to differences in group centroid rather than caused by within-group dispersion (F¬†=¬†1.5173, p >¬†0.05). 3.6 Phyllosphere-rhizosphere co-transplantation transplanted more taxa than single transplantation The quantification of ASVs that were successfully transplanted to the recipients' plants in the MT-Exp revealed that PR treatment had more transplanted taxa (7 ASVs) than P treatment (5 ASVs) in the phyllosphere niches ( Fig. 5 A). Similarly, in the rhizosphere habitat, the number of transplanted taxa in the PR treatment (204 ASVs) was also greater than those in the R treatment (179 ASVs) ( Fig. 5 B). In terms of taxonomy at the phylum level, for the phyllosphere transplanted taxa, 7 ASVs of the PR treatment belonged to 7 different phyla, while 3 out of 5 ASVs of the P treatment were under phylum Bacteroidota ( Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, Proteobacteria was the most predominant rhizosphere transplanted taxa in both PR and R treatments, followed by Planctomycetota, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteriota, and Acidobacteriota ( Fig. 5 B). The complete list of transplanted taxa and their taxonomic lineage are provided in the Table S2 . The quantification of ASVs that were successfully transplanted to the recipients' plants in the MT-Exp revealed that PR treatment had more transplanted taxa (7 ASVs) than P treatment (5 ASVs) in the phyllosphere niches ( Fig. 5 A). Similarly, in the rhizosphere habitat, the number of transplanted taxa in the PR treatment (204 ASVs) was also greater than those in the R treatment (179 ASVs) ( Fig. 5 B). In terms of taxonomy at the phylum level, for the phyllosphere transplanted taxa, 7 ASVs of the PR treatment belonged to 7 different phyla, while 3 out of 5 ASVs of the P treatment were under phylum Bacteroidota ( Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, Proteobacteria was the most predominant rhizosphere transplanted taxa in both PR and R treatments, followed by Planctomycetota, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteriota, and Acidobacteriota ( Fig. 5 B). The complete list of transplanted taxa and their taxonomic lineage are provided in the Table S2. 3.7 Phyllosphere-rhizosphere co-transplantation hosted the highest number of connections between above- and below-ground microbial communities Microbiome co-occurrence network analysis was performed to estimate potential interactions between above- and below-ground microbial communities. The results showed that the PR treatment had the highest number of nodes and interactions, followed by R and P treatments, while C (control) was the lowest ( Fig. 6 ). Notably, only some transplanted taxa possessed connections between phyllosphere and rhizosphere niches: 1 out of 5 ASVs in P treatment ( Fig. 6 B); 7 out of 179 ASVs in R treatment ( Fig. 6 C); 4 out of 7 ASVs and 17 out of 204 ASVs in PR treatment ( Fig. 6 D). From the network topology, 2, 3, 16, and 23 ASVs were identified as the hub nodes in the C, P, R, and PR networks, respectively ( Table S3 ). Moreover, some of these hub nodes were ASVs that were previously assigned as transplanted taxa, including B17818- Bacteroides in the P network, B02146-Acetobacteraceae in the R network, and B15940-Micrococcaceae and B12427- Fimbriiglobus in PR network ( Table S3 ). Some of them were observed to have a positive correlation with other taxa known as plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), such as [P] B17818- Bacteroides with [R] B04078- Devosia in the P network (Fig. S2B) and [R] B12427- Fimbriiglobus with [P] B03194- Methylobacterium in PR network (Fig. S2D). Microbiome co-occurrence network analysis was performed to estimate potential interactions between above- and below-ground microbial communities. The results showed that the PR treatment had the highest number of nodes and interactions, followed by R and P treatments, while C (control) was the lowest ( Fig. 6 ). Notably, only some transplanted taxa possessed connections between phyllosphere and rhizosphere niches: 1 out of 5 ASVs in P treatment ( Fig. 6 B); 7 out of 179 ASVs in R treatment ( Fig. 6 C); 4 out of 7 ASVs and 17 out of 204 ASVs in PR treatment ( Fig. 6 D). From the network topology, 2, 3, 16, and 23 ASVs were identified as the hub nodes in the C, P, R, and PR networks, respectively (Table S3). Moreover, some of these hub nodes were ASVs that were previously assigned as transplanted taxa, including B17818- Bacteroides in the P network, B02146-Acetobacteraceae in the R network, and B15940-Micrococcaceae and B12427- Fimbriiglobus in PR network (Table S3). Some of them were observed to have a positive correlation with other taxa known as plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), such as [P] B17818- Bacteroides with [R] B04078- Devosia in the P network (Fig. S2B) and [R] B12427- Fimbriiglobus with [P] B03194- Methylobacterium in PR network (Fig. S2D). 4 Discussion Several studies have already discussed how important microbial diversity is for plant growth and productivity in the agroecosystem (reviewed by ( Gupta et al., 2021 ; Kaul et al., 2021 ; Santos and Olivares, 2021 )). Although single isolates or synthetic microbial consortia have been described to confer beneficial traits to stimulate plant growth and development ( Armanhi et al., 2018 ; Yin et al., 2022 ; Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ), only a few works evaluated the positive influence of the whole phyllosphere and/or rhizosphere microbiome transplantation on plant growth stimulation and the proportion of survival taxa in the new host environment ( Zahn and Amend, 2017 ; Lu et al., 2018 ; Morella et al., 2020 ; Jiang et al., 2022a ). In this study, a phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment (MT-Exp) using sugarcane plantlets as the host plant combined with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was carried out to dissect the important role of above- and below-ground microbial interactions for robust plant colonization and growth promotion. The microbial sources used in the MT-Exp were collected from an organic sugarcane farm, as we have previously shown that the organic practice hosted a vast diversity of the microbial community and PGPB as microbial signatures ( Khoiri et al., 2021 ). Our result exhibited that either single or co-transplantation of both phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes from sugarcane cultivated in farm soil to sugarcane plantlets grown in a pot significantly enhanced plant growth as observed from the total biomass. We also demonstrated that co-transplantation of both the above- and below-ground microbial communities of a single individual plant increased the number of successfully transplanted taxa that might importantly contribute to the observed growth enhancement of the recipient plants. The alpha diversity analysis revealed that transplanting only the phyllosphere microbiome significantly increased the species richness of the phyllosphere community in recipient plants compared to un-transplanted plants (C and R treatment). A similar effect was also observed in the rhizosphere community, where plants that did not receive rhizosphere microbiome transplantation (C and P treatment) exhibited significantly lower rhizosphere microbial richness. In contrast, co-transplantation did not yield significantly different species richness indices for phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbial communities compared to single transplantations (P and R treatments). These findings suggested that both transplantation methods exerted a comparable influence on microbial alpha diversity for above- and below-ground plant compartments. Furthermore, correlation analysis demonstrated a positive relationship between species richness of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbial communities and the total plant biomass. Therefore, the increase in species richness in response to microbiome transplantation resulted in beneficial impacts on the growth and development of the host plants, as reported in previous studies ( Laforest-Lapointe et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2022 ). In short, whether single or co-transplant, microbiome transplantation positively influenced microbial alpha diversity in both above- and below-ground plant compartments and potentially enhanced plant growth and development. The ability of microbial inoculants to colonize and thrive on the target host is one of the most important factors in determining the efficacy of microbial-based biofertilizers ( Finkel et al., 2017 ; Romano et al., 2020 ). In this study, the number of successfully transplanted taxa in both plant compartments could be applied as an indicator of successful transplantation. The highest number was detected in the PR treatment, indicating the microbial inoculants' survivability from co-transplantation of both phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes on the recipient host plants. It also implied that phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbial communities are interconnected with each other. The potential communications between the two microbial communities are likely to be mediated by phytohormonal and metabolic responses, such as leaf and root exudations. For instance, a previous study has shown that Arabidopsis thaliana changed their root exudate profiles to alter the composition and recruit beneficial rhizosphere microbiota in response to foliar pathogen infection ( Yuan et al., 2018 ). Another work demonstrated that inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to soil could modify milkweed's foliar cardenolide concentration and composition, a toxic compound used to defend against herbivores ( Vannette et al., 2013 ). It was also noticed that, regardless of the transplantation methods, the numbers of transplanted taxa observed in the phyllosphere were much lower than those in the rhizosphere. It might be due to the characteristics of the phyllosphere habitat, which is considered a harsh environment with limited nutrient availability compared to other parts of the plant, such as the root, rhizosphere, and soil ( Vorholt, 2012 ). Consequently, this condition could have a significant impact on the composition and diversity of the phyllosphere microbiome and restrict the success of phyllosphere microbiome transplantation ( Mercier and Lindow, 2000 ; Vorholt, 2012 ; Chaudhry et al., 2020 ). In addition, the efficacy of bacterial transfer onto the phyllosphere might have been affected by environmental conditions such as humidity during the spraying process ( Morella et al., 2020 ). This could be the reason for no significant difference found in the beta diversity of phyllosphere microbes ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ), as a few numbers of transplanted taxa might not be able to change the overall community profile. On the opposite, a higher portion of transplanted rhizosphere microbes could have a strong influence on the rhizosphere community profile, as evidenced by the separation of the samples according to treatments on the PCoA plot ( Fig. 4 ) and the statistical significance of the PERMANOVA test ( Table 1 ). Furthermore, among these transplanted taxa, Proteobacteria was the most predominant transplanted bacterial phylum in the rhizosphere habitat as well as the topmost abundant phylum in all MT-Exp samples ( Fig. 2 ). This finding is in line with the previous rhizosphere microbiome transplantation experiment on tomato plants, revealing that a vast diversity of total- and core-transplanted taxa belonged to Proteobacteria ( Jiang et al., 2022a ). Taken together, co-transplantation of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes shows promise for enhancing microbial inoculant survivability and influencing plant-microbe interactions. However, challenges persist in effectively colonizing the phyllosphere and understanding its complex dynamics. We previously identified one of the microbial signatures of organic sugarcane phyllosphere belonging to the genus Bacillus ( Khoiri et al., 2021 ). In the present study, we found that an ASV taxonomically assigned as [P] B17948- Bacillus was successfully transplanted to leaves of recipient plants via both single and co-transplantation methods (P and PR treatments), implying that the microbial signatures could be transferable. Other bacterial genera that are commonly known to have plant growth-promoting activities were also discovered to be parts of transplanted taxa in the rhizosphere of recipient plants (R and PR treatments), including Arthrobacter ( Jiang et al., 2022b ) , Bacillus ( Yuan et al., 2013 ) , Bradyrhizobium ( Rodrigues et al., 2013 ) , Burkholderia ( Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al., 2014 ) , Mesorhizobium ( Laranjo et al., 2014 ) , Methylobacterium ( Jirakkakul et al., 2023 ) , Paenibacillus ( Liu et al., 2021 ) , Pseudomonas ( Singh et al., 2021 ) , Rhizobium ( Wdowiak-Wr√≥bel et al., 2017 ) , Sphingomonas ( Wang et al., 2020 ) , and Streptomyces ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Altogether, these transplanted PGPB might contribute to the growth stimulation of the recipient plants when compared to the un-transplanted plants. Microbiome co-occurrence network was further performed to analyze the impact of microbiome transplantation and the potential roles of the transplanted taxa on the interactions between above- and below-ground microbial communities. The analysis results showed that PR treatment had the highest number of nodes and connections, indicating that the co-transplantation of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes might facilitate the preservation of essential connections among microbes inhabiting above- and below-ground compartments. It has been recognized that preserving original microbe-microbe interactions could considerably increase microbial survival and maintain functional traits that they carry out ( Nichols et al., 2010 ; de Souza et al., 2020 ). As expected, the control plants displayed the lowest network connectivity, as they should be nearly sterile and likely harbored only a few random microbes. Moreover, several transplanted taxa were also identified as the hub node in the network. For instance, in the P network, 1 out of 3 hubs was the transplanted taxa, taxonomically assigned as [P] B17818- Bacteroides . Bacteroides were reported to have the ability to utilize plant polysaccharides, as well as oligosaccharides derived from plant cell walls ( Van Laere et al., 2000 ). [R] B02146-Acetobacteraceae was the hub and transplanted taxa in the R network. Many members of the family Acetobacteraceae were known as bacteria that fix nitrogen, capable of promoting plant growth through several mechanisms ( Reis and Teixeira, 2015 ). Meanwhile, the PR network had the greatest number of hub nodes, and 2 of them were transplanted taxa taxonomically assigned as [P] B15940-Micrococcaceae and [R] B12427- Fimbriiglobus . Numerous taxa belonging to the family Micrococcaceae were found to participate in the biodegradation of environmental pollutants ( Dastager et al., 2014 ), while Fimbriiglobus had a chitinolytic capability ( Ravin et al., 2018 ). Interestingly, [R] B12427- Fimbriiglobus had a strong positive correlation with another PGPB, i.e., [P] B03194- Methylobacterium, which was also identified as the hub in the PR network. Similarly, [P] B17818- Bacteroides also displayed a positive association with a PGPB, i.e., [R] B04078- Devosia , in the P network. These results implied that transplanted taxa might serve as a central hub and interact with other beneficial bacteria in the community to promote plant growth. Collectively, this finding suggested that above- and below-ground microbial interactions might play an important role in the colonization of the target host, and the transplanted taxa might act as the key in this inter-compartment networking. However, the molecular mechanism of how above- and below-ground microbial communities communicate with each other remains elusive, and future studies are required. One limitation of this study is the focus on bacterial communities, with limited consideration given to other potentially important microbial groups such as fungi and rare bacteria. These microbes could still play significant roles in plant health and ecosystem dynamics. While efforts were made to optimize transplantation techniques, including considerations for humidity levels, future studies could benefit from more detailed methodologies to enhance bacterial transfer onto plant surfaces. It is important to note that the lack of successful bacterial transfer onto the leaves compared to rhizosphere microbes in this study does not diminish the potential importance of the phyllosphere community in plant health and development. Addressing these limitations in future research endeavors would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of microbial transplantation dynamics and their implications for plant-microbe interactions. 5 Conclusions In the present study, our results have demonstrated that microbiome transplantation could significantly increase species richness and induce distinct microbial profiles, particularly in the rhizosphere community of sugarcane. Co-transplantation of both phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes emerged as the most effective strategy for promoting sugarcane growth and enhancing microbial inoculant survivability on the plant. Overall, our findings highlighted the interconnectedness of above- and below-ground microbes, emphasizing the necessity of considering both when designing and applying microbial inoculants, such as biofertilizers, to promote plant growth and development sustainably. However, further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of inter-compartment communication between above- and below-ground microbes.
