The mt genome is a circular molecule with 14,889 nucleotides and an A + T content of 76.6%, and it has triplicate putative CRs. We propose that tandem duplication and deletion account for the evolution of the CR and the gene translocations. Intramitochondrial recombination is a plausible model for the gene inversions. We discuss the excessive duplicate CR sequences and the transcription of the rRNA genes, which are distant from one another and from the CR. Finally, we address the significance of the complicated mt genomes in Thysanoptera for the evolution of the CR and the gene arrangement of the mt genome."

          "The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of most animals are circular DNA molecules of approximately 15–17 kb in size that encode 37 genes: 13 protein-coding genes (ATP synthase subunits 6 and 8 [ atp6 , atp8 ], cytochrome oxidase subunits 1–3 [ cox1 – cox3 ], cytochrome b [ cob ], and NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1–6 and 4L [ nad1 – nad6 , nad4L ]), 2 rRNA genes (large and small ribosomal subunit RNAs [ rrnL and rrnS , respectively]), and 22 tRNA genes ( Boore, 1999; Wolstenholme, 1992 ). The control region (CR) is the major non-coding region of the mt genome and is essential for the initiation of transcription and mtDNA replication in the mt genomes of metazoa. It is variable in both size and nucleotide sequence ( Shadel and Clayton, 1997; Zhang and Hewitt, 1997 ). The mt genomes of most metazoa studied to date have only one CR. However, those of some snakes (Kumazawa et al., 1996) , sea cucumbers (Arndt and Smith, 1998) , metastriate ticks ( Black and Roehrdanz, 1998; Campbell and Barker, 1999 ), Amazon parrots (Eberhard et al., 2001) , a fish (Lee et al., 2001) , a thrips (Shao and Barker, 2003) , a sea firefly (Ogoh and Ohmiya, 2004) , some ticks ( Shao et al., 2005 ), some chigger mites (Shao et al., 2006) and a booklice (Wei et al., 2012) have duplicate CRs. Specifically, there are two separate CRs with identical or highly similar nucleotide sequences. Recently, three CRs were detected in the velvet worm (Braband et al., 2010) . Intriguingly, 18 CRs were in the 18 minicircular chromosomes of the human lice ( Shao et al., 2009 ).",
          "Three mechanisms may account for mt genomes with duplicate CRs: tandem duplication, dimerization, and illegitimate recombination (Boore, 2000) . A single tandem duplication followed by deletions of redundant copies of genes can explain the duplicate CRs and/or gene rearrangements in the mt genomes of most of the metazoa that exhibit duplicate CRs. However, when duplicate CRs and highly gene rearrangement existed simultaneously in mt genomes such as the plague thrips and the sea firefly, numerous tandem duplication and deletions, and/or illegitimate recombination were proposed for the evolution of these genomes ( Ogoh and Ohmiya, 2004; Shao and Barker, 2003 ).",
          "Once duplicate CRs exist, they may evolve either in concert or independently. Independent evolution leads to the divergence of the nucleotide sequences of the two CRs and the eventual degeneration or deletion of one CR (Bensch and Härlid, 2000) . Conversely, concerted evolution, which can maintain the sequence similarity of the nucleotide sequences of the two CRs, is frequently hypothesized ( Arndt and Smith, 1998; Black and Roehrdanz, 1998; Eberhard et al., 2001; Kumazawa et al., 1996; Shao et al., 2005 ). Kumazawa et al. (1998) proposed two mechanisms for the concerted evolution of duplicate CRs: tandem duplication and gene conversion. During southern hybridization experiments on snakes, the tandem duplication and deletion model was supported by the larger mtDNA molecule detected in the gene organization of the minor mtDNA, but this did not exclude the possibility of gene conversion (Kumazawa et al., 1998) .",
          "In contrast to most insects, there are a variety of gene rearrangements and different rates of gene rearrangement in the hemipteroid assemblage, thus making it an excellent model system for studies of the evolution of animal mt genomes (Shao and Barker, 2003) . Furthermore, the duplicate control regions and gene translocations of Thrips imaginis (Thysanoptera) could not be explained by a single tandem duplication followed by deletions of one copy of the duplicate genes with retention of the two control regions because of their highly rearranged mt genomes. Therefore, we attempted to obtain additional data to examine the gene rearrangement and the evolution of CR in the hemipteroid assemblage.",
          "The aims of this study were to sequence the entire nucleotide sequence of the mt genome of the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis , discuss the possible mechanisms of evolution of triplicated CRs and gene rearrangements in F. occidentalis , and evaluate the value of studying the complete mt genomes of Thysanoptera, which exhibit extensive rearrangements."

Live thrips were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 70 °C. Total DNA was extracted from one thrips using the Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit Ver.3.0 (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). Two pairs of primers were designed, based upon the cox1 (GenBank accession numbers: HQ697598 ) and cox3 (GenBank accession numbers: AM941946 ) sequences for F. occidentalis . The entire mt genome of F. occidentalis was amplified in these overlapping fragments by long polymerase chain reaction (PCR): C1-1026-2-F (5′‐TTGACTTCTTCCACCCTCTTTAACATTAT‐3′) with C3-1026-2-R (5′‐ATTGAAGGACAGAAAAGTAAATTCCCAAA‐3′) and C3-0329-F (5′‐CTTACACCATTTCATCTTGTTTCACCGAGACCTT‐3′) with C1-0329-R (5′‐TAAACTGTTCATCCTGTTCCTGCACCATCTTTTG‐3′). The names of the primers indicate the target gene (C1 for cox1 and C3 for cox3). The two fragments were 3132 base pairs (bp) and 12,358 bp long, respectively, and overlapped by 78 bp of cox1 and 523 bp of cox3. Premix LA Taq Hot Start Version (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) was used to perform long PCR amplification. The cycling conditions of the short PCR were 1 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C, and then 10 min at 68 °C for C1-1026-2-F and C3-1026-2-R. The long PCR was performed under the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle (2 min at 92 °C), 10 cycles (10 s at 92 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C), 20 cycles (10 s at 92 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C with 1 cycle of elongation of 20 s for each cycle), and 1 cycle (a prolonged elongation for 7 min at 68 °C) for C3-0329-F and C1-0329-R."

Then sheared DNA was blunt end-repaired, gel purified and cleaned up. Resulting fragments were ligated into the SmaI site of a pUC18 cloning vector and electroporated into One Shot® TOP10 Electrocomp™ Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) using standard protocols. Recombinant clones were screened by PCR using M13 universal primers. Obtained recombinant colonies were purified and sequenced using M13 universal primers. Raw sequences were manually corrected and assembled into contigs with the software Sequencher 4.6 (Gene Codes) and the final assemblies were based on a minimum sequence coverage of 3 ×.",

Base compositions, codon usage and amino acid usage were conducted with MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al., 2011) . We identified tRNA genes with tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997) . Some tRNA genes that could not be found by tRNAscan-SE were identified by eye or by inspection for anti-codon sequences and secondary structures (Kumazawa and Nishida, 1993) . BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1997) identified protein-coding and rRNA genes. Hydrophilicity profile comparisons (Hopp and Woods, 1981) were also used to identify or confirm protein-coding genes."

Interestingly, unlike most animal mt genomes, this genome has three putative CRs ( Fig. 1 ). Three obvious stem-loops were identified in three CRs. The majority-strand encodes 31 genes, whereas the minority-strand encodes 6 genes. Six pairs of neighboring genes apparently overlap by 1 to 2 bp: trnP – trnY , trnA – trnF , nad4 – nad4L , nad3 – trnL , trnR – trnG , and trnG – trnK . The gene arrangement of the fruit fly Drosophila yakuba (Clary and Wolstenholme, 1985) is inferred to be ancestral for hexapods (Shao and Barker, 2003) . The gene arrangement in the mt genome of F. occidentalis is dramatically different than the putative arrangement of the ancestral hexapods: 23 genes have translocated, 8 of which have also inverted."

Among the 3620 codons of the 13 protein-coding genes in the mt genome of F. occidentalis , the A + T-richness was reflected further in the codon usage. There is a strong bias against C + G (A, 39.5%; T, 46%; C, 8%; G, 6.5%) at the third codon positions of the protein-coding genes ( Table 1 ), as observed in the mt genomes of other insects (Crease, 1999) .

All codons are present in the protein-coding genes of this genome, but UAG and CGC are used only once each. ATA and ATT apparently initiate the translations of five and seven genes, respectively. Four genes appeared to have incomplete termination codons: T for nad1 , atp8 , nad4 , and nad4L . TAG apparently terminates the translation of cox3 , and TAA terminates the translations of the other eight genes ( Table 2 )."

Three CRs have been reported in Metaperipatus inae (Braband et al., 2010) . Intriguingly, the mt genome of Pediculus humanus consists of 18 minicircular chromosomes and has 18 CRs (Shao et al., 2009) .",

In contrast to CR3, CR1 and CR2 contain an additional sequence of 13 bp, presumably derived from a portion of Nad5 .",
              "We assume that the first step leading to the production of triplicate putative CRs is a single tandem duplication of the mt genome followed by deletions of redundant copies of genes, with the duplicate CR retained. This process can account for the duplicate CRs in the mt genomes of most of the metazoa exhibiting duplicate CRs.",
              "According to the tandem duplication and deletion model proposed for the concerted evolution of CRs or sequence homogenization between two CRs (Kumazawa et al., 1998) , a region surrounded by CRs is tandemly duplicated via a mechanism such as imprecise termination and/or slipped-strand mispairing (Moritz and Brown, 1986, 1987) . This may give rise to a larger mt genome exhibiting three homogeneous CRs. This larger mtDNA likely exercises considerable economy with respect to size and gene number. As a consequence, repetitive sequences would likely be deleted, but triplicate putative CRs would be retained. It should be noted that we consider a gene conversion mechanism much less likely; however, more experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.",
              "Excessive CR sequences appear to have been retained because the duplication of the CR brings positive functional advantages such as efficient initiation of replication or transcription from multiple sites ( Arndt and Smith, 1998; Kumazawa et al., 1996; Umeda et al., 2001 ). This apparently elevates the efficiency of DNA replication and gene expression. It is probably reasonable to speculate that mt genomes with duplicate or triplicated CRs may have an advantage over mt genomes with one CR for transcription of the rRNA genes that are distant from one another in the CR of F. occidentalis and T. imaginis ."

If the evolution of CRs is related to the translocations of genes, tandem duplication and deletion may produce the translocations observed here. Comparing with the putative arrangement of the ancestral hexapods, all genes between CRs 1 and 3 translocated and/or inverted in the mt genome of F. occidentalis . Moreover, seven different tRNA genes between T. imaginis and F. occidentalis were near the CRs ( Fig. 6 ).",

Because nad1 , trnL1 , rrnL , trnV and rrnS were in one block in the ancestral arrangement, these genes were probably inverted together. Therefore, intramitochondrial recombination ( Dowton and Austin, 1999; Dowton and Campbell, 2001 ) might account for the gene inversions in the mt genome of F. occidentalis . Similar recombination also happened in Primeuchroeus sp. ( trnL1 , rrnL , trnV and rrnS ) (Castro et al., 2006) .

However, those of some snakes (Kumazawa et al., 1996) , sea cucumbers (Arndt and Smith, 1998) , metastriate ticks ( Black and Roehrdanz, 1998; Campbell and Barker, 1999 ), Amazon parrots (Eberhard et al., 2001) , a fish (Lee et al., 2001) , a thrips (Shao and Barker, 2003) , a sea firefly (Ogoh and Ohmiya, 2004) , some ticks ( Shao et al., 2005 ), some chigger mites (Shao et al., 2006) and a booklice (Wei et al., 2012) have duplicate CRs. Specifically, there are two separate CRs with identical or highly similar nucleotide sequences. Recently, three CRs were detected in the velvet worm (Braband et al., 2010) . Intriguingly, 18 CRs were in the 18 minicircular chromosomes of the human lice ( Shao et al., 2009 ). Three mechanisms may account for mt genomes with duplicate CRs: tandem duplication, dimerization, and illegitimate recombination (Boore, 2000) . A single tandem duplication followed by deletions of redundant copies of genes can explain the duplicate CRs and/or gene rearrangements in the mt genomes of most of the metazoa that exhibit duplicate CRs. However, when duplicate CRs and highly gene rearrangement existed simultaneously in mt genomes such as the plague thrips and the sea firefly, numerous tandem duplication and deletions, and/or illegitimate recombination were proposed for the evolution of these genomes ( Ogoh and Ohmiya, 2004; Shao and Barker, 2003 ). Once duplicate CRs exist, they may evolve either in concert or independently. Independent evolution leads to the divergence of the nucleotide sequences of the two CRs and the eventual degeneration or deletion of one CR (Bensch and Härlid, 2000) . Conversely, concerted evolution, which can maintain the sequence similarity of the nucleotide sequences of the two CRs, is frequently hypothesized ( Arndt and Smith, 1998; Black and Roehrdanz, 1998; Eberhard et al., 2001; Kumazawa et al., 1996; Shao et al., 2005 ). Kumazawa et al. (1998) proposed two mechanisms for the concerted evolution of duplicate CRs: tandem duplication and gene conversion. During southern hybridization experiments on snakes, the tandem duplication and deletion model was supported by the larger mtDNA molecule detected in the gene organization of the minor mtDNA, but this did not exclude the possibility of gene conversion (Kumazawa et al., 1998) . In contrast to most insects, there are a variety of gene rearrangements and different rates of gene rearrangement in the hemipteroid assemblage, thus making it an excellent model system for studies of the evolution of animal mt genomes (Shao and Barker, 2003) . Furthermore, the duplicate control regions and gene translocations of Thrips imaginis (Thysanoptera) could not be explained by a single tandem duplication followed by deletions of one copy of the duplicate genes with retention of the two control regions because of their highly rearranged mt genomes. Therefore, we attempted to obtain additional data to examine the gene rearrangement and the evolution of CR in the hemipteroid assemblage. The aims of this study were to sequence the entire nucleotide sequence of the mt genome of the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis , discuss the possible mechanisms of evolution of triplicated CRs and gene rearrangements in F. occidentalis , and evaluate the value of studying the complete mt genomes of Thysanoptera, which exhibit extensive rearrangements. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Collection of F. occidentalis and long polymerase chain reaction amplification Specimens of F. occidentalis were collected from the Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Live thrips were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 70 °C. Total DNA was extracted from one thrips using the Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit Ver.3.0 (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). Two pairs of primers were designed, based upon the cox1 (GenBank accession numbers: HQ697598 ) and cox3 (GenBank accession numbers: AM941946 ) sequences for F. occidentalis . The entire mt genome of F. occidentalis was amplified in these overlapping fragments by long polymerase chain reaction (PCR): C1-1026-2-F (5′‐TTGACTTCTTCCACCCTCTTTAACATTAT‐3′) with C3-1026-2-R (5′‐ATTGAAGGACAGAAAAGTAAATTCCCAAA‐3′) and C3-0329-F (5′‐CTTACACCATTTCATCTTGTTTCACCGAGACCTT‐3′) with C1-0329-R (5′‐TAAACTGTTCATCCTGTTCCTGCACCATCTTTTG‐3′). The names of the primers indicate the target gene (C1 for cox1 and C3 for cox3). The two fragments were 3132 base pairs (bp) and 12,358 bp long, respectively, and overlapped by 78 bp of cox1 and 523 bp of cox3. Premix LA Taq Hot Start Version (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) was used to perform long PCR amplification. The cycling conditions of the short PCR were 1 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C, and then 10 min at 68 °C for C1-1026-2-F and C3-1026-2-R. The long PCR was performed under the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle (2 min at 92 °C), 10 cycles (10 s at 92 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C), 20 cycles (10 s at 92 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C with 1 cycle of elongation of 20 s for each cycle), and 1 cycle (a prolonged elongation for 7 min at 68 °C) for C3-0329-F and C1-0329-R. 2.2 Sequencing and analysis The entire 3132 bp fragment was cloned into a pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) and sequenced with the PCR primers and internal primers. The 12,358 bp fragment was sequenced by shotgun sequencing method (Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Amplicons were randomly sheared to segments. Then sheared DNA was blunt end-repaired, gel purified and cleaned up. Resulting fragments were ligated into the SmaI site of a pUC18 cloning vector and electroporated into One Shot® TOP10 Electrocomp™ Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) using standard protocols. Recombinant clones were screened by PCR using M13 universal primers. Obtained recombinant colonies were purified and sequenced using M13 universal primers. Raw sequences were manually corrected and assembled into contigs with the software Sequencher 4.6 (Gene Codes) and the final assemblies were based on a minimum sequence coverage of 3 ×. Sequences were assembled manually with the overlap of the two fragments and aligned against the published complete mt genome sequences of T. imaginis using the ClustalW program. Base compositions, codon usage and amino acid usage were conducted with MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al., 2011) . We identified tRNA genes with tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997) . Some tRNA genes that could not be found by tRNAscan-SE were identified by eye or by inspection for anti-codon sequences and secondary structures (Kumazawa and Nishida, 1993) . BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1997) identified protein-coding and rRNA genes. Hydrophilicity profile comparisons (Hopp and Woods, 1981) were also used to identify or confirm protein-coding genes. 3 Results 3.1 General features of the mt genome The mt genome of F. occidentalis is circular and comprised 14,889 bp (GenBank accession numbers: JN835456 ) (Supplementary materials). The nucleotide composition of the majority-strand is 6101 A (40.98%), 1646 C (11.06%), 5452 T (36.62%), and 1690 G (11.35%). This genome has all of the 37 genes commonly found in animal mt genomes. Interestingly, unlike most animal mt genomes, this genome has three putative CRs ( Fig. 1 ). Three obvious stem-loops were identified in three CRs. The majority-strand encodes 31 genes, whereas the minority-strand encodes 6 genes. Six pairs of neighboring genes apparently overlap by 1 to 2 bp: trnP – trnY , trnA – trnF , nad4 – nad4L , nad3 – trnL , trnR – trnG , and trnG – trnK . The gene arrangement of the fruit fly Drosophila yakuba (Clary and Wolstenholme, 1985) is inferred to be ancestral for hexapods (Shao and Barker, 2003) . The gene arrangement in the mt genome of F. occidentalis is dramatically different than the putative arrangement of the ancestral hexapods: 23 genes have translocated, 8 of which have also inverted. 3.2 Protein-coding genes BLAST searches failed to identify atp8 and nad4L ; these two genes were identified by comparing the hydrophilicity profiles of their putative proteins to those of D. yakuba and T. imaginis ( Fig. 2 ) ( Clary and Wolstenholme, 1985; Shao and Barker, 2003 ). Among the 3620 codons of the 13 protein-coding genes in the mt genome of F. occidentalis , the A + T-richness was reflected further in the codon usage. There is a strong bias against C + G (A, 39.5%; T, 46%; C, 8%; G, 6.5%) at the third codon positions of the protein-coding genes ( Table 1 ), as observed in the mt genomes of other insects (Crease, 1999) . Six A + T-rich codons (encoding amino acids Asn, Ile, Lys, Met, Phe, and Tyr) appear 1649 times (45.7%), whereas four C + G-rich codons (encoding amino acids Ala, Arg, Gly, and Pro) are present 429 times (11.89%). All codons are present in the protein-coding genes of this genome, but UAG and CGC are used only once each. ATA and ATT apparently initiate the translations of five and seven genes, respectively. Four genes appeared to have incomplete termination codons: T for nad1 , atp8 , nad4 , and nad4L . TAG apparently terminates the translation of cox3 , and TAA terminates the translations of the other eight genes ( Table 2 ). 3.3 tRNA genes The mt genome of F. occidentalis has 22 tRNA genes. The A + T content of the tRNA genes is 79.8%, which is higher than the overall A + T composition of the mtDNA. The secondary structures of 17 tRNA genes were determined to be complete clover-leafs by tRNAscan-SE Search Server v.1.21. The structures of the other five tRNAs ( trnN , trnR , trnC , trnS [ ucu ], and trnV ) were estimated by manual arrangement based on its anti-codon sequence and inferred secondary structure ( Fig. 3 ). The anti-codon nucleotides for the corresponding tRNA genes are identical to those commonly found in typical arthropod mt genomes. The trnV gene has lost the D-arm, a phenomenon also observed in T. imaginis . Furthermore, one-nucleotide overlaps occur in trnP – trnY , trnA – trnF , trnR – trnG , and trnG – trnK . Interestingly, the trnS2 was located inside the rrnL . 3.4 rRNA genes BLAST searches indicated that rrnS is between trnF and atp8 and that rrnL is between trnV and cox1 . We aligned the nucleotide sequences of these two regions with rrnS and rrnL of D. yakuba and T. imaginis , respectively, and estimated the boundaries of rrnS and rrnL of F. occidentalis . The arrangement of these two rRNA genes in F. occidentalis is similar to T. imaginis and is extraordinary for an arthropod. The two rRNA genes are not close to one another and distant from any of the putative CRs. Furthermore, in most arthropods, the minority-strand encodes the two rRNA genes, whereas the majority-strand encodes these genes in F. occidentalis . 3.5 Non-coding regions There are apparently 882 noncoding nucleotides in the mt genome of F. occidentalis : 287 bp in 16 intergenic regions and 595 bp in 3 large noncoding regions. The three large noncoding regions are 212 bp, 197 bp, and 186 bp in length, and they have 147 bp in common ( Fig. 4 ). To find the CR, we searched for specific unique patterns (e.g., T-stretch, A + T-rich segment, stem-loop, and G[A]nT) that are typical of CRs (Zhang and Hewitt, 1997) . The identified patterns in these regions are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . We identified the three regions as putative CRs. We were not able to identify tandem repeat sequences even though T. imaginis exhibits repeated sequences in long CRs. 3.6 Arrangement of genes Compared to the putative ancestral gene arrangement for hexapods, 23 genes in the mt genome of F. occidentalis have been rearranged, 8 of which have also inverted ( Fig. 6 ). These rearrangements comprise translocations of 10 tRNA genes and 5 protein-coding genes, and translocations and inversions of 5 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 1 protein-coding gene. Only 6 of the 38 ancestral gene boundaries are present in F. occidentalis : trnL 2 – cox2 , nad2 – trnW , atp8 – atp6 , nad4L – nad4 – trnH , and trnV – rrnL . In addition, none of the CRs is in the inferred ancestral position for hexapods. Furthermore, compared to T. imaginis , seven tRNA genes have translocated ( Fig. 6 ). 4 Discussion 4.1 Triplicate putative CRs Duplicated CRs are found in the snake Dinodon semicarinatus (Kumazawa et al., 1998) , cephalopod Loligo bleekeri (Tomita et al., 2002) , brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Black and Roehrdanz, 1998) , plague thrips Thrips imagines (Shao and Barker, 2003) , sea-firefly Vargula hilgendorfii (Ogoh and Ohmiya, 2004) , Australasian Ixodes ticks ( Shao et al., 2005 ), Leptotrombidium mites (Shao et al., 2006) and Liposcelis bostrychophila (Wei et al., 2012) . Three CRs have been reported in Metaperipatus inae (Braband et al., 2010) . Intriguingly, the mt genome of Pediculus humanus consists of 18 minicircular chromosomes and has 18 CRs (Shao et al., 2009) . However, F. occidentalis exhibit triplicate CRs which the mt sequence consists of a single circular chromosome, i.e., three separate CRs with identical or highly similar nucleotide sequences. In contrast to CR3, CR1 and CR2 contain an additional sequence of 13 bp, presumably derived from a portion of Nad5 . We assume that the first step leading to the production of triplicate putative CRs is a single tandem duplication of the mt genome followed by deletions of redundant copies of genes, with the duplicate CR retained. This process can account for the duplicate CRs in the mt genomes of most of the metazoa exhibiting duplicate CRs. According to the tandem duplication and deletion model proposed for the concerted evolution of CRs or sequence homogenization between two CRs (Kumazawa et al., 1998) , a region surrounded by CRs is tandemly duplicated via a mechanism such as imprecise termination and/or slipped-strand mispairing (Moritz and Brown, 1986, 1987) . This may give rise to a larger mt genome exhibiting three homogeneous CRs. This larger mtDNA likely exercises considerable economy with respect to size and gene number. As a consequence, repetitive sequences would likely be deleted, but triplicate putative CRs would be retained. It should be noted that we consider a gene conversion mechanism much less likely; however, more experiments are needed to test this hypothesis. Excessive CR sequences appear to have been retained because the duplication of the CR brings positive functional advantages such as efficient initiation of replication or transcription from multiple sites ( Arndt and Smith, 1998; Kumazawa et al., 1996; Umeda et al., 2001 ). This apparently elevates the efficiency of DNA replication and gene expression. It is probably reasonable to speculate that mt genomes with duplicate or triplicated CRs may have an advantage over mt genomes with one CR for transcription of the rRNA genes that are distant from one another in the CR of F. occidentalis and T. imaginis . 4.2 Gene rearrangements The most widely accepted model for explaining the translocations of mt genes is duplication-random loss (duplication of mtDNA followed by the loss of one copy of each duplicated gene) ( Gai et al., 2008; Kumazawa et al., 1998; Lavrov et al., 2002; Macey et al., 1997 ). If the evolution of CRs is related to the translocations of genes, tandem duplication and deletion may produce the translocations observed here. Comparing with the putative arrangement of the ancestral hexapods, all genes between CRs 1 and 3 translocated and/or inverted in the mt genome of F. occidentalis . Moreover, seven different tRNA genes between T. imaginis and F. occidentalis were near the CRs ( Fig. 6 ). Because numerous gene rearrangements have apparently occurred in the mt genome of F. occidentalis , tandem duplication and deletions may have occurred multiple times throughout the evolution of these genomes, such as is evident in T. imaginis and the sea firefly ( Ogoh and Ohmiya, 2004; Shao and Barker, 2003 ). All eight genes on the minority-strand of the mt genome that have inverted in F. occidentalis have also inverted in T. imaginis . Because nad1 , trnL1 , rrnL , trnV and rrnS were in one block in the ancestral arrangement, these genes were probably inverted together. Therefore, intramitochondrial recombination ( Dowton and Austin, 1999; Dowton and Campbell, 2001 ) might account for the gene inversions in the mt genome of F. occidentalis . Similar recombination also happened in Primeuchroeus sp. ( trnL1 , rrnL , trnV and rrnS ) (Castro et al., 2006) . In addition, the inversion of trnF , trnQ , and trnC occurred in parallel in F. occidentalis and T. imaginis . 4.3 Conclusions and perspectives Besides that reported in the present study, there is only one other completely sequenced mt genome for Thysanoptera species (Shao and Barker, 2003) . Similar to T. imaginis , F. occidentalis also exhibits seven different tRNA genes: those in hotspot regions (Dowton and Austin, 1999) such as near the CR, and in the two clusters of tRNA genes, trnK – trnD and trnA – trnR – trnN – trnS – trnE – trnF . An intermediate gene arrangement between the ancestral pattern and the arrangement found in T. imaginis and F. occidentalis would provide insight into the evolution of the CR and the gene arrangement of the mt genome of Thysanoptera. In addition, a study of the complete mt genomes of additional Thysanoptera species will provide more detailed information of the interordinal phylogeny of the hemipteroid assemblage and will help reconstruct the Thysanoptera phylogenetic relationships such as has been done for Hymenoptera ( Castro and Dowton, 2007; Dowton et al., 2009 ), Diptera (Cameron et al., 2007) , Orthoptera (Fenn et al., 2008) , Coleoptera ( Pons et al., 2010; Timmermans et al., 2010 ), and Phasmatodean (Kômoto et al., 2011) .
