    "full_text": "Developmental studies of sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) have provided much insight into the process of morphological evolution of vertebrates. Although those studies are supposedly fueled by large-scale molecular sequencing information, whole-genome sequences of sharks and rays were made available only recently. One compelling difficulty of elasmobranch developmental biology is the low accessibility to embryonic study materials and their slow development. Another limiting factor is the relatively large size of their genomes. Moreover, their large body sizes restrict sustainable captive breeding, while their high body fluid osmolarity prevents reproducible cell culturing for in vitro experimentation, which has also limited our knowledge of their chromosomal organization for validation of genome sequencing products. This article focuses on egg-laying elasmobranch species used in developmental biology and provides an overview of the characteristics of the shark and ray genomes revealed to date. Developmental studies performed on a gene-by-gene basis are also reviewed from a whole-genome perspective. Among the popular regulatory genes studied in developmental biology, I scrutinize shark homologs of Wnt genes that highlight vanishing repertoires in many other vertebrate lineages, as well as Hox genes that underwent an unexpected modification unique to the elasmobranch lineage. These topics are discussed together with insights into the reconstruction of developmental programs in the common ancestor of vertebrates and its subsequent evolutionary trajectories that mark the features that are unique to, and those characterizing the diversity among, cartilaginous fishes."

          "Sharks (Selachimorpha) and rays (Batoidea, also including skates and torpedos, but collectively called rays in this article for simplicity), which are referred to collectively as elasmobranchs, are cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes) with a common ancestor that diverged from osteichthyans, the extant remainder of the jawed vertebrates, about 450 million years ago ( Irisarri et al., 2017 ). This divergence precedes the radiation of the other jawed vertebrate lineages, including humans and traditional laboratory model species, allowing cartilaginous fishes to serve as an outgroup of all extant osteichthyans. Although regarded as ‘fish’ in a broad sense, cartilaginous fishes occupy a unique phylogenetic position, among which sharks and rays have particularly enriched the species diversity. The antiquity of the cartilaginous fish lineage prompted the researchers who pursue the vertebrate ancestor to study sharks and rays in search of the evolutionary origins of various developmental processes ( Davis et al., 2012 ). This avenue of research is carried out based on cross-species comparisons among cartilaginous fishes, which can now involve molecular-level information supported by emerging whole-genome sequences. The traditional targets of these analyses include the origins of the jaw (e.g., Debiais-Thibaud et al., 2013 ; Takechi et al., 2013 ), limbs (homologous to elasmobranch paired fins) (e.g., Okamoto et al., 2017 ; Onimaru et al., 2016 ; reviewed in Cole and Currie, 2007 ), cerebellum (e.g., Butts et al., 2011 ; Pose-Mendez et al., 2016a , b ; Sugahara et al., 2017 ), oral and dermal denticles (e.g., Berio and Debiais-Thibaud, 2019 ; Gillis et al., 2017 ), and pharyngeal arches (e.g., Gillis et al., 2013 ; Gillis and Tidswell, 2017 ). These studies employed cross-species comparisons of expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms of elasmobranch orthologs of genes that were characterized previously in mammals. However, such comparative studies usually included only one elasmobranch species, and thus they hardly shed light on potentially dramatic among-lineage discrepancies. It is also because they often rely on the orthology of regulatory genes that are often well-conserved.",
          "The significance of studying elasmobranchs is not confined to the scope of vertebrate-wide comparisons, but also deepens our understanding of the diversity observed within elasmobranchs. This is crucial in the reconstruction of the process of vertebrate evolution, which could potentially be biased by autapomorphic characters of a selected species. Developmental biology largely relies on access to embryos as study materials, which is generally facilitated by oviparity; however, the majority of elasmobranch species are livebearers (viviparous) ( Fig. 1 A). Elasmobranchs exhibit fascinating reproductive plasticity (see Dudgeon et al., 2017 ; Nakaya et al., 2020 for recent reports), but the switch of the reproductive mode between oviparity and viviparity remains unknown ( Penfold and Wyffels, 2019 ). The phenotypic diversity of elasmobranchs is primarily marked by body size variability, from pigmy sharks (<30 ​cm) to the largest extant fish, the whale shark (>10 ​m). Their morphological diversity is further featured by a variable thickness of body trunks, as in the remarkable extremities of angelsharks (Squatiniformes; Fig. 2 C) and most rays (excluding those in the order Rhinopristiformes; Fig. 2 G), which have flat bodies. The body flatness and the associated anatomical features were formerly considered as a synapomorphy of the monophyletic group “Hypnosqualea,” which includes these groups of species and was later refuted by molecular phylogenetic analyses ( Douady et al., 2003 ). Taken together, it is now widely accepted that the flat body was acquired independently during evolution in the batoid ancestor and later in one or more shark lineage(s) ( Aschliman et al., 2012 ; Nelson et al., 2016 ). Another outstanding example of convergence is the independent gain of a toothed snout, called “denticulate rostrum,” by sawsharks (a group of shark species; Fig. 1 A) and sawfishes (a group of ray species; Fig. 2 FA). The other aspects of morphological variability include the number of gills ( Fig. 1 A) and the “synarcual,” which is an anterior part of the axial skeleton into which multiple vertebrae are fused that is shared by chimaeras and rays ( Johanson et al., 2013 , 2019 ), as well as the number and positioning of the fin and fin spines. In tackling these aspects of the morphological diversity of elasmobranchs, genomic analysis is expected to provide some clues of developmental processes even for elusive or viviparous species with low accessibility to embryonic materials. The prerequisite for this expectation is that the molecular basis of morphogenesis is elucidated in oviparous species suitable for developmental biological studies."

              "Although modern sequencing technologies have been applied to the genomes of atypical study systems, such as coelacanth and spotted gar, elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) have long escaped intensive whole-genome sequencing. In its early days, the genome sequencing of elasmobranchs was repeatedly planned or commenced (e.g., for Squalus acanthias and Leucoraja erinacea ) but was not finished until recently, mainly because of the relatively large sizes of their genomes, often exceeding that of humans (approximately 3.2 ​Gbp). For the less species-rich group of the two cartilaginous fish lineages, Holocephali, the genome sequencing of the elephant fish Callorhinchus milii ( Fig. 2 H) was initiated long before 2010 ( Venkatesh et al., 2007 ). This species is often called “elephant shark” but is not a true shark (Selachimorpha in Fig. 1 A). This holocephalan genome of only 1.9 ​Gbp ( Venkatesh et al., 2005 ) stood as the only genome assembly available for cartilaginous fishes for many years ( Venkatesh et al., 2014 ). Several traditional topics related to early vertebrate evolution, such as immunology and bone mineralization, have been investigated using the genome sequences of C. milii as a chondrichthyan representative ( Venkatesh et al., 2014 ); however, a more elaborate embryological analysis of this species has been hindered by the modest availability of embryonic materials, mainly because of its limited geographic distribution (also see Didier et al., 1998 for the description of embryonic development of this species).",
              "As the advanced sequencing technologies became more accessible, the whole genomes of several pelagic, live-bearing (viviparous) species were sequenced ( Marra et al., 2019 ; Read et al., 2017 ; Weber et al., 2020 ). However, the limited opportunities for tissue sampling did not allow data production to support high-quality genome sequences and gene prediction (e.g., transcriptome sequence data), which partly led to the generation of misleading results (see Yamaguchi and Kuraku, 2021 ). In parallel, whole-genome sequencing has been demonstrated for several egg-laying (oviparous) elasmobranch species ( Hara et al., 2018b ; Zhang et al., 2020 ), which is detailed in the next section."

              "Among the ~1200 elasmobranch species, oviparity occurs only in several independent lineages; i.e., catsharks in Carcharhiniformes, bullhead sharks in Heterodontiformes, some carpet sharks in Orectolobiformes, and skates in Rajiformes ( Fig. 1 A). Catshark species in the family Scyliorhinidae ( Scyliorhinus canicula , S. retifer , and S. torazame ; Fig. 2 B), which grow to no more than 70 ​cm and have high fecundity, have been frequently chosen for developmental biology studies ( Coolen et al., 2008 ), as have some skates (e.g., species in the genera Raja , Leucoraja , and Okamejei ) ( Fig. 1 B). Among the egg-laying species, the brownbanded bamboo shark Chiloscyllium punctatum ( Figs. 2 A and 3 ) in Asia-Pacific waters, which is often found in public aquariums, has also been identified as a promising research target ( Harahush et al., 2007 ). This bottom-dwelling species reaches a size as large as 1.5 ​m but develops faster than many other egg-laying elasmobranch species because it inhabits temperate waters (about 120 days until hatching at 25 ​°C). The author's research group closely monitored the morphogenetic process of this bamboo shark species, to table its developmental stages ( Onimaru et al., 2018 ). The adaptation of culture medium to high body fluid osmolarity led to reproducible cell culture ( Fig. 3 C), which enabled karyotyping that had stood as a long-term obstacle in shark genomics ( Fig. 3 D; Uno et al., 2020 ). The stable supply of study materials for this species also enabled us to release draft genome sequences that were assembled with reference to its genome size quantified using flow cytometry (4.73 ​Gbp; Hara et al., 2018b ). In comparison, many other egg-laying shark species in the genera Heterodontus or Scyliorhinus have even larger genome sizes (e.g., S. torazame , 6.67 ​Gbp; S. canicula , 5.0 ​Gbp). Continuous studies of multiple species will consolidate our understanding of cartilaginous fish development, which requires in-depth consideration of the availability of study materials and the difficulties associated with their large genome size.",
              "The diversity of cartilaginous fishes has been established for a much longer time (~400 million years) than that of any other vertebrate lineage; approximately 200 million years for mammals and 100 million years for birds. For example, the divergence time between the brownbanded bamboo shark and a catshark in Scyliorhinidae is estimated at 180 million years, while the split between a shark and a ray is as old as around 300 million years. Considering the remarkable phenotypic discrepancy even between the human and the mouse, which diverged relatively recently around 80-million-years ago, it would be worthwhile to cover multiple elasmobranch species to represent these divergent evolutionary lineages."

              "The genomes of elasmobranch fishes contain relatively large numbers of chromosomes ( Uno et al., 2020 ; reviewed in Stingo and Rocco, 2001 ). One could associate these characteristics with possible additional whole-genome duplication (WGD) events in their unique lineage, as is evident in teleost fishes. To date, however, genome-wide analyses have detected no WGD unique to sharks or rays ( Hara et al., 2018b ). It has also been well accepted that the elasmobranch ancestor diverged from the stem vertebrate lineage after the so-called “two-round” WGD (2R-WGD) was completed—the author's phylogenetic investigation previously suggested that the 2R-WGD occurred even earlier, before the radiation of all extant vertebrates including cyclostomes, namely hagfishes and lampreys ( Kuraku et al., 2009 ; reviewed in Kuraku, 2013 ; also see Simakov et al., 2020 ; Smith and Keinath, 2015 for analyses refuting this timing or the occurrence of 2R-WGD). The other extant lineage that branched off in early vertebrate evolution, leading to cyclostomes, is thought to have experienced an additional WGD ( Mehta et al., 2013 ), although this needs to be thoroughly examined (discussed in Onimaru and Kuraku, 2018 ). These findings suggest that cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays, most likely have maintained the same ploidy level as humans, mice, and chickens as a result of the 2R-WGD. This guarantees straightforward comparisons of genomic components and their molecular function between elasmobranchs and osteichthyans."

            "paragraphs": [
              "If no WGD was involved, what else drove the increase of genome size in the elasmobranch lineage? The possible biological causes of genome size variation have been repeatedly discussed ( Monaghan and Metcalfe, 2000 ) and investigated for individual taxa ( Kapusta et al., 2017 ; Liedtke et al., 2018 ). Based on viviparous shark genome analysis, Marra et al. proposed that the large genome size and high abundance of repetitive elements are hallmarks of species with enhanced longevity, namely the white shark and whale shark ( Marra et al., 2019 ). This hypothesis is, however, questioned by a reanalysis involving other shark species ( Yamaguchi and Kuraku, 2021 ). One of the few currently available clues for understanding the variation of genome size among sharks is its correlation with intron length ( Fig. 4 B; Hara et al., 2018b ). It is speculated that introns and intergenic regions are evenly elongated in large shark genomes ( Fig. 4 C and D), which should necessarily incur a higher cost of energy, space, and time in cellular processes such as transcription, replication, and the structuring of chromatins (see Heyn et al., 2015 ; Keane and Seoighe, 2016 ; Swinburne and Silver, 2008 for the relevance of intron length). A previous survey with ChIP-seq detected a greater number of putative CTCF binding sites in shark genomes, than in some other vertebrates with smaller genome sizes ( Hara et al., 2018b; Kadota et al., 2017 . However, the cross-species difference in this comparison may have resulted from technical factors in controlling the sensitivity of enrichment detection as well as variable qualities of genome assemblies.",
              "Compared with plants, our knowledge about large genomes in animals is highly rudimentary and is currently limited mostly to the axolotl and Australian lungfish genomes (of 32 and 37 ​Gbp, respectively), which were sequenced to reveal an intron length increase and no additional WGD ( Meyer et al., 2021 ; Nowoshilow et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). As speculated above, genome enlargement should demand more time for gene expression and more space in the nucleus for packaging DNA molecules. The significance of time and space in developmental biology has been increasingly recognized (reviewed in Ebisuya and Briscoe, 2018 ), which would facilitate the integrative understanding of genome size variation, long known as the “C-value paradox” ( Thomas, 1971 ; reviewed in Gregory, 2005 ). Therein, shark genomes may provide intriguing test cases. Interestingly, shark species with increased genome sizes often inhabit the deep sea (e.g., angular roughshark and velvet belly lanternshark, both with genomes >15 ​Gbp). It should be examined whether metabolic rate, which is likely decreased in deep-sea fishes, is involved in the tuning of genome size (see Gardner et al., 2020 for the examination of other vertebrate lineages)."

              "Another aspect of the genome-wide trend revealed by the recent analysis of shark genomes is their nucleotide and amino acid compositions ( Fig. 4 E and F). Previously, through a comparison with osteichthyan vertebrates, lamprey genes were shown to have peculiar patterns of protein-coding sequences, namely a high GC-content in synonymous sites, a strong codon usage bias, and a distinct composition of amino acids in protein sequences ( Qiu et al., 2011 ; Smith et al., 2013 ; reviewed in Manousaki et al., 2016 ). In contrast, sharks exhibit a relatively low GC-content with small intragenomic variation in protein-coding regions ( Fig. 4 E), as well as highly similar amino acid compositions to those of tetrapod genomes ( Fig. 4 F). Among-lineage discrepancies in GC-content and peculiar amino acid compositions tend to confound molecular phylogenetic analysis (see Kuraku, 2013 for the difficulties encountered in cyclostomes). The high similarity of sequence compositions between sharks and tetrapods promises a reliable molecular phylogenetic inference supported by the fidelity of their sequences to standard methods."

              "Recent whole-genome studies have shown unexpected and intriguing cases of gene losses in vertebrate genomes that are seemingly responsible for its phenotypes— tbx4 in seahorses ( Lin et al., 2016 ) and Bmp4 in the axolotl ( Nowoshilow et al., 2018 ). These cases prompt us to scan similar cases in elasmobranch genomes that are responsible for morphological diversity among elasmobranchs. Even though several elasmobranch genomes have been sequenced, the absence of certain genomic components in them cannot yet be reliably inferred without complete genome sequences, ideally of multiple species. Conversely, shark genome analyses revealed gene loss in the lineage leading to the human and traditional laboratory species. An early example in this category was the Hoxd14 gene, which was discovered long after the documentation of the Hox 1−13 genes ( Powers and Amemiya, 2004 ). This gene, absent from all the mammalian and teleost fish genomes analyzed so far, was firmly inferred to have existed in the vertebrate ancestor and is now confined to cartilaginous fishes ( Feiner et al., 2011 ).",
              "Among well-studied gene families comprising typical targets of developmental biological analyses, the Wnt family ( Loh et al., 2016 ) has provided valuable opportunities to assess genome-wide trends of gene repertoire conservation and discrepancies across divergent animal lineages ( Holstein, 2012 ). Whole-genome analysis on multiple shark species ( Hara et al., 2018b ) revealed four subtypes of the Wnt gene family, namely Wnt4b , Wnt6b , Wnt7c , and Wnt11b , the orthologs of which do not exist in the genomes of eutherian mammals ( Fig. 5 A). Each of these Wnt subtypes arose as one of the gene duplicates derived from WGD and has been maintained in at least one shark genome (see Fig. 5 B for the case of Wnt6b ). The Wnt11b orthologs were phylogenetically recognized and previously reported for reptiles and birds ( Kuraku and Kuratani, 2011 ). The Wnt7c gene was also previously recognized in Xenopus laevis ( Garriock et al., 2007 ) and is the only case in the Wnt gene family that exhibits three subtypes ( Wnt7a , Wnt7b , and Wnt7c ) duplicated in the vertebrate lineage (except for those derived from teleost fish lineage-specific duplications) that still exist currently. Wnt4b and Wnt6b have not been recognized as an ancient vertebrate subtype (except for those named for a teleost fish-specific duplicate), until the recent shark genome analysis ( Hara et al., 2018b ).",
              "It was previously suggested that a genomic cluster of several Wnt genes found in some invertebrates eroded during evolution, and is currently found as remnants containing only up to two Wnt genes in vertebrates ( Holstein, 2012 ). The Wnt6b gene in the bamboo shark is located between the Wnt1 and Wnt10b orthologs ( Hara et al., 2018b ), thus forming a 70 ​kbp-long trigene Wnt cluster that was identified for the first time in a vertebrate ( Fig. 5 C). The gene designated Wnt4b was previously identified in teleost fishes but was thought to be a duplicate unique to these fishes ( Liu et al., 2000 ). The coelacanth has also retained the respective orthologs of Wnt4b , Wnt6b , and Wnt7c , suggesting that these genes are not confined to a small subset of vertebrates and most likely existed in the vertebrate ancestor. These genes and the genomic linkage between them are intriguing targets of future studies in search of genomic factors accounting for phenotypic differences between these vertebrate lineages."

              "The author's group has identified and documented additional long-standing vertebrate genes that are expressed during development, with orthologs lost in humans and some traditional laboratory species; this group of genes was termed “cryptic pan-vertebrate genes” (reviewed in Kuraku et al., 2016 ). Many of the genes in this category, including FoxG2 , FoxG3 ( Hara et al., 2018a, 2018b ), Bmp16 ( Feiner et al., 2019 ), Nodal 2 ( Kajikawa et al., 2020 ), and Pax10 ( Feiner et al., 2014 ), have retained orthologs in at least one shark species. The numerous examples presented here may prompt researchers to adopt a genome-wide view that shark and ray genomes have preserved more genomic components from the vertebrate ancestor. This view seems to be consistent with the lack of additional WGD and the high conservation of the primary sequence compositions described above. It still needs to be examined by considering the gene loss frequency in the elasmobranch lineage, when high-quality genome sequences become available for multiple elasmobranch species in the future. The possible high gene retention in elasmobranch genomes could be explained by the reduced constraint in limiting the size of the genome—enlarged genomes could accommodate more genes, although the gene lengths per se make a minor contribution to the genome size."

Then, what genomic change could have facilitated the morphological variation observed among cartilaginous fishes? One striking hint originated from comparative studies of Hox genes, harboring traditional themes related to the morphogenetic regulation of vertebrate body plans (reviewed in Mallo et al., 2010 ). Since the initial study reported in 2000 ( Kim et al., 2000 ), elasmobranch Hox A, B, and D genes have been identified as expected ( Oulion et al., 2010 ). The vertebrate Hox gene clusters tend to be approximately 100 ​kbp long ( Darbellay et al., 2019 ; Duboule, 2007 ), even in the enlarged shark genomes ( Hara et al., 2018b , Fig. 6 A and B). This genomic spacing constraint in Hox clusters, independent of the entire genome-wide landscape, will provide insights into the factors that determine the regional spacing and overall sizing of the genomes."

              "The genome of the holocephalan C. milii harbors four Hox clusters (A−D), as expected from many other vertebrates ( Ravi et al., 2009 ). In elasmobranchs, Hox C genes have escaped comprehensive surveys, such as BAC library screenings ( Oulion et al., 2010 ) and transcriptome sequencing using RNA-seq ( Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018 ). This repeated unsuccess in the identification of shark and ray Hox C genes once prompted researchers to suggest a loss of the entire Hox C cluster in elasmobranchs ( King et al., 2011 )—note that no presentable whole-genome sequences were available for any elasmobranch species at this stage. It was not until 2018 that the elusive Hox C genes of elasmobranchs were identified and reported through whole-genome sequencing in multiple shark species ( Hara et al., 2018b , Fig. 6 A).",
              "Considering the technical details that resulted in gene (mis)identification, it seemed crucial to minimize the bias in library preparation and sequencing and perform exhaustive sequence searches in resultant fragments that are difficult to assemble. The Hox C genes identified to date ( Fig. 6 E) have a high GC-content, high synonymous substitution rates, and divergent amino acid sequences (see Fig. 6 D for the increased amino acid substitution rate of HoxC8 ; Hara et al., 2018b ). The genomic regions flanking those Hox C genes are also GC-rich, have few or no Hox genes in the vicinity, and harbor more repetitive elements ( Fig. 6 A; Hara et al., 2018b ). It should be verified using a high-quality reference assembly to examine if all putative Hox C genes of the brownbanded bamboo shark are located in a continuous genomic sequence. Some Hox C genes have been implicated in the specification of the anteroposterior identities of axial elements ( Jegalian and De Robertis, 1992 ; Pollock et al., 1992 ; reviewed in Wellik, 2009 ). Thus, it is of great interest to determine whether the potential variability of the retained members of the Hox C cluster ( Fig. 6 E) is associated with the morphological variation of elasmobranchs, such as the numbers and positions of fins and gill openings. Additionally, since the proposal of the entire loss of the elasmobranch Hox C cluster ( King et al., 2011 ), several studies were performed under the assumption that the whole Hox C cluster is completely lost (e.g., Jung et al., 2018 ; Oulion et al., 2011 ), and therefore these findings should now be reassessed. Some elasmobranch genomes have been sequenced using the single-molecule sequencing platform for producing long reads, which is thought to be free from GC bias; however, strangely, no Hox C genes have been found in these genome assemblies of the whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ; GCA_001642345.2, ASM164234v2), the thorny skate ( Amblyraja radiata ; GCA_010909765.1, sAmbRad1.pri; Rhie et al., 2021 ), and the small-spotted catshark ( Scyliorhinus canicula ; GCA_902713625.1, sScyCan1.1), according to a search performed by the author. The currently available elasmobranch genome assemblies have suboptimal continuity or lack a considerable proportion of the whole genome (up to 30%). This is expected to be improved by high-fidelity long-read sequencing that allows genome assembly of lengthy repetitive sequences abundant in elasmobranch genomes."

This divergence precedes the radiation of the other jawed vertebrate lineages, including humans and traditional laboratory model species, allowing cartilaginous fishes to serve as an outgroup of all extant osteichthyans. Although regarded as ‘fish’ in a broad sense, cartilaginous fishes occupy a unique phylogenetic position, among which sharks and rays have particularly enriched the species diversity. The antiquity of the cartilaginous fish lineage prompted the researchers who pursue the vertebrate ancestor to study sharks and rays in search of the evolutionary origins of various developmental processes ( Davis et al., 2012 ). This avenue of research is carried out based on cross-species comparisons among cartilaginous fishes, which can now involve molecular-level information supported by emerging whole-genome sequences. The traditional targets of these analyses include the origins of the jaw (e.g., Debiais-Thibaud et al., 2013 ; Takechi et al., 2013 ), limbs (homologous to elasmobranch paired fins) (e.g., Okamoto et al., 2017 ; Onimaru et al., 2016 ; reviewed in Cole and Currie, 2007 ), cerebellum (e.g., Butts et al., 2011 ; Pose-Mendez et al., 2016a , b ; Sugahara et al., 2017 ), oral and dermal denticles (e.g., Berio and Debiais-Thibaud, 2019 ; Gillis et al., 2017 ), and pharyngeal arches (e.g., Gillis et al., 2013 ; Gillis and Tidswell, 2017 ). These studies employed cross-species comparisons of expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms of elasmobranch orthologs of genes that were characterized previously in mammals. However, such comparative studies usually included only one elasmobranch species, and thus they hardly shed light on potentially dramatic among-lineage discrepancies. It is also because they often rely on the orthology of regulatory genes that are often well-conserved. The significance of studying elasmobranchs is not confined to the scope of vertebrate-wide comparisons, but also deepens our understanding of the diversity observed within elasmobranchs. This is crucial in the reconstruction of the process of vertebrate evolution, which could potentially be biased by autapomorphic characters of a selected species. Developmental biology largely relies on access to embryos as study materials, which is generally facilitated by oviparity; however, the majority of elasmobranch species are livebearers (viviparous) ( Fig. 1 A). Elasmobranchs exhibit fascinating reproductive plasticity (see Dudgeon et al., 2017 ; Nakaya et al., 2020 for recent reports), but the switch of the reproductive mode between oviparity and viviparity remains unknown ( Penfold and Wyffels, 2019 ). The phenotypic diversity of elasmobranchs is primarily marked by body size variability, from pigmy sharks (<30 ​cm) to the largest extant fish, the whale shark (>10 ​m). Their morphological diversity is further featured by a variable thickness of body trunks, as in the remarkable extremities of angelsharks (Squatiniformes; Fig. 2 C) and most rays (excluding those in the order Rhinopristiformes; Fig. 2 G), which have flat bodies. The body flatness and the associated anatomical features were formerly considered as a synapomorphy of the monophyletic group “Hypnosqualea,” which includes these groups of species and was later refuted by molecular phylogenetic analyses ( Douady et al., 2003 ). Taken together, it is now widely accepted that the flat body was acquired independently during evolution in the batoid ancestor and later in one or more shark lineage(s) ( Aschliman et al., 2012 ; Nelson et al., 2016 ). Another outstanding example of convergence is the independent gain of a toothed snout, called “denticulate rostrum,” by sawsharks (a group of shark species; Fig. 1 A) and sawfishes (a group of ray species; Fig. 2 FA). The other aspects of morphological variability include the number of gills ( Fig. 1 A) and the “synarcual,” which is an anterior part of the axial skeleton into which multiple vertebrae are fused that is shared by chimaeras and rays ( Johanson et al., 2013 , 2019 ), as well as the number and positioning of the fin and fin spines. In tackling these aspects of the morphological diversity of elasmobranchs, genomic analysis is expected to provide some clues of developmental processes even for elusive or viviparous species with low accessibility to embryonic materials. The prerequisite for this expectation is that the molecular basis of morphogenesis is elucidated in oviparous species suitable for developmental biological studies. 2 Elasmobranch genome sequencing 2.1 Belated application of modern technologies Although modern sequencing technologies have been applied to the genomes of atypical study systems, such as coelacanth and spotted gar, elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) have long escaped intensive whole-genome sequencing. In its early days, the genome sequencing of elasmobranchs was repeatedly planned or commenced (e.g., for Squalus acanthias and Leucoraja erinacea ) but was not finished until recently, mainly because of the relatively large sizes of their genomes, often exceeding that of humans (approximately 3.2 ​Gbp). For the less species-rich group of the two cartilaginous fish lineages, Holocephali, the genome sequencing of the elephant fish Callorhinchus milii ( Fig. 2 H) was initiated long before 2010 ( Venkatesh et al., 2007 ). This species is often called “elephant shark” but is not a true shark (Selachimorpha in Fig. 1 A). This holocephalan genome of only 1.9 ​Gbp ( Venkatesh et al., 2005 ) stood as the only genome assembly available for cartilaginous fishes for many years ( Venkatesh et al., 2014 ). Several traditional topics related to early vertebrate evolution, such as immunology and bone mineralization, have been investigated using the genome sequences of C. milii as a chondrichthyan representative ( Venkatesh et al., 2014 ); however, a more elaborate embryological analysis of this species has been hindered by the modest availability of embryonic materials, mainly because of its limited geographic distribution (also see Didier et al., 1998 for the description of embryonic development of this species). As the advanced sequencing technologies became more accessible, the whole genomes of several pelagic, live-bearing (viviparous) species were sequenced ( Marra et al., 2019 ; Read et al., 2017 ; Weber et al., 2020 ). However, the limited opportunities for tissue sampling did not allow data production to support high-quality genome sequences and gene prediction (e.g., transcriptome sequence data), which partly led to the generation of misleading results (see Yamaguchi and Kuraku, 2021 ). In parallel, whole-genome sequencing has been demonstrated for several egg-laying (oviparous) elasmobranch species ( Hara et al., 2018b ; Zhang et al., 2020 ), which is detailed in the next section. 2.2 Restricted choice of species Among the ~1200 elasmobranch species, oviparity occurs only in several independent lineages; i.e., catsharks in Carcharhiniformes, bullhead sharks in Heterodontiformes, some carpet sharks in Orectolobiformes, and skates in Rajiformes ( Fig. 1 A). Catshark species in the family Scyliorhinidae ( Scyliorhinus canicula , S. retifer , and S. torazame ; Fig. 2 B), which grow to no more than 70 ​cm and have high fecundity, have been frequently chosen for developmental biology studies ( Coolen et al., 2008 ), as have some skates (e.g., species in the genera Raja , Leucoraja , and Okamejei ) ( Fig. 1 B). Among the egg-laying species, the brownbanded bamboo shark Chiloscyllium punctatum ( Figs. 2 A and 3 ) in Asia-Pacific waters, which is often found in public aquariums, has also been identified as a promising research target ( Harahush et al., 2007 ). This bottom-dwelling species reaches a size as large as 1.5 ​m but develops faster than many other egg-laying elasmobranch species because it inhabits temperate waters (about 120 days until hatching at 25 ​°C). The author's research group closely monitored the morphogenetic process of this bamboo shark species, to table its developmental stages ( Onimaru et al., 2018 ). The adaptation of culture medium to high body fluid osmolarity led to reproducible cell culture ( Fig. 3 C), which enabled karyotyping that had stood as a long-term obstacle in shark genomics ( Fig. 3 D; Uno et al., 2020 ). The stable supply of study materials for this species also enabled us to release draft genome sequences that were assembled with reference to its genome size quantified using flow cytometry (4.73 ​Gbp; Hara et al., 2018b ). In comparison, many other egg-laying shark species in the genera Heterodontus or Scyliorhinus have even larger genome sizes (e.g., S. torazame , 6.67 ​Gbp; S. canicula , 5.0 ​Gbp). Continuous studies of multiple species will consolidate our understanding of cartilaginous fish development, which requires in-depth consideration of the availability of study materials and the difficulties associated with their large genome size. The diversity of cartilaginous fishes has been established for a much longer time (~400 million years) than that of any other vertebrate lineage; approximately 200 million years for mammals and 100 million years for birds. For example, the divergence time between the brownbanded bamboo shark and a catshark in Scyliorhinidae is estimated at 180 million years, while the split between a shark and a ray is as old as around 300 million years. Considering the remarkable phenotypic discrepancy even between the human and the mouse, which diverged relatively recently around 80-million-years ago, it would be worthwhile to cover multiple elasmobranch species to represent these divergent evolutionary lineages. 3 What characterizes the genomes of elasmobranchs? 3.1 Ploidy level The genomes of elasmobranch fishes contain relatively large numbers of chromosomes ( Uno et al., 2020 ; reviewed in Stingo and Rocco, 2001 ). One could associate these characteristics with possible additional whole-genome duplication (WGD) events in their unique lineage, as is evident in teleost fishes. To date, however, genome-wide analyses have detected no WGD unique to sharks or rays ( Hara et al., 2018b ). It has also been well accepted that the elasmobranch ancestor diverged from the stem vertebrate lineage after the so-called “two-round” WGD (2R-WGD) was completed—the author's phylogenetic investigation previously suggested that the 2R-WGD occurred even earlier, before the radiation of all extant vertebrates including cyclostomes, namely hagfishes and lampreys ( Kuraku et al., 2009 ; reviewed in Kuraku, 2013 ; also see Simakov et al., 2020 ; Smith and Keinath, 2015 for analyses refuting this timing or the occurrence of 2R-WGD). The other extant lineage that branched off in early vertebrate evolution, leading to cyclostomes, is thought to have experienced an additional WGD ( Mehta et al., 2013 ), although this needs to be thoroughly examined (discussed in Onimaru and Kuraku, 2018 ). These findings suggest that cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays, most likely have maintained the same ploidy level as humans, mice, and chickens as a result of the 2R-WGD. This guarantees straightforward comparisons of genomic components and their molecular function between elasmobranchs and osteichthyans. 3.2 Genome size variation If no WGD was involved, what else drove the increase of genome size in the elasmobranch lineage? The possible biological causes of genome size variation have been repeatedly discussed ( Monaghan and Metcalfe, 2000 ) and investigated for individual taxa ( Kapusta et al., 2017 ; Liedtke et al., 2018 ). Based on viviparous shark genome analysis, Marra et al. proposed that the large genome size and high abundance of repetitive elements are hallmarks of species with enhanced longevity, namely the white shark and whale shark ( Marra et al., 2019 ). This hypothesis is, however, questioned by a reanalysis involving other shark species ( Yamaguchi and Kuraku, 2021 ). One of the few currently available clues for understanding the variation of genome size among sharks is its correlation with intron length ( Fig. 4 B; Hara et al., 2018b ). It is speculated that introns and intergenic regions are evenly elongated in large shark genomes ( Fig. 4 C and D), which should necessarily incur a higher cost of energy, space, and time in cellular processes such as transcription, replication, and the structuring of chromatins (see Heyn et al., 2015 ; Keane and Seoighe, 2016 ; Swinburne and Silver, 2008 for the relevance of intron length). A previous survey with ChIP-seq detected a greater number of putative CTCF binding sites in shark genomes, than in some other vertebrates with smaller genome sizes ( Hara et al., 2018b; Kadota et al., 2017 . However, the cross-species difference in this comparison may have resulted from technical factors in controlling the sensitivity of enrichment detection as well as variable qualities of genome assemblies. Compared with plants, our knowledge about large genomes in animals is highly rudimentary and is currently limited mostly to the axolotl and Australian lungfish genomes (of 32 and 37 ​Gbp, respectively), which were sequenced to reveal an intron length increase and no additional WGD ( Meyer et al., 2021 ; Nowoshilow et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). As speculated above, genome enlargement should demand more time for gene expression and more space in the nucleus for packaging DNA molecules. The significance of time and space in developmental biology has been increasingly recognized (reviewed in Ebisuya and Briscoe, 2018 ), which would facilitate the integrative understanding of genome size variation, long known as the “C-value paradox” ( Thomas, 1971 ; reviewed in Gregory, 2005 ). Therein, shark genomes may provide intriguing test cases. Interestingly, shark species with increased genome sizes often inhabit the deep sea (e.g., angular roughshark and velvet belly lanternshark, both with genomes >15 ​Gbp). It should be examined whether metabolic rate, which is likely decreased in deep-sea fishes, is involved in the tuning of genome size (see Gardner et al., 2020 for the examination of other vertebrate lineages). 3.3 Sequence compositions Another aspect of the genome-wide trend revealed by the recent analysis of shark genomes is their nucleotide and amino acid compositions ( Fig. 4 E and F). Previously, through a comparison with osteichthyan vertebrates, lamprey genes were shown to have peculiar patterns of protein-coding sequences, namely a high GC-content in synonymous sites, a strong codon usage bias, and a distinct composition of amino acids in protein sequences ( Qiu et al., 2011 ; Smith et al., 2013 ; reviewed in Manousaki et al., 2016 ). In contrast, sharks exhibit a relatively low GC-content with small intragenomic variation in protein-coding regions ( Fig. 4 E), as well as highly similar amino acid compositions to those of tetrapod genomes ( Fig. 4 F). Among-lineage discrepancies in GC-content and peculiar amino acid compositions tend to confound molecular phylogenetic analysis (see Kuraku, 2013 for the difficulties encountered in cyclostomes). The high similarity of sequence compositions between sharks and tetrapods promises a reliable molecular phylogenetic inference supported by the fidelity of their sequences to standard methods. 4 Gene repertoires: more genes retained in shark and ray genomes? 4.1 Quest for lost genes: exemplar family-wide assessment of Wnt genes Recent whole-genome studies have shown unexpected and intriguing cases of gene losses in vertebrate genomes that are seemingly responsible for its phenotypes— tbx4 in seahorses ( Lin et al., 2016 ) and Bmp4 in the axolotl ( Nowoshilow et al., 2018 ). These cases prompt us to scan similar cases in elasmobranch genomes that are responsible for morphological diversity among elasmobranchs. Even though several elasmobranch genomes have been sequenced, the absence of certain genomic components in them cannot yet be reliably inferred without complete genome sequences, ideally of multiple species. Conversely, shark genome analyses revealed gene loss in the lineage leading to the human and traditional laboratory species. An early example in this category was the Hoxd14 gene, which was discovered long after the documentation of the Hox 1−13 genes ( Powers and Amemiya, 2004 ). This gene, absent from all the mammalian and teleost fish genomes analyzed so far, was firmly inferred to have existed in the vertebrate ancestor and is now confined to cartilaginous fishes ( Feiner et al., 2011 ). Among well-studied gene families comprising typical targets of developmental biological analyses, the Wnt family ( Loh et al., 2016 ) has provided valuable opportunities to assess genome-wide trends of gene repertoire conservation and discrepancies across divergent animal lineages ( Holstein, 2012 ). Whole-genome analysis on multiple shark species ( Hara et al., 2018b ) revealed four subtypes of the Wnt gene family, namely Wnt4b , Wnt6b , Wnt7c , and Wnt11b , the orthologs of which do not exist in the genomes of eutherian mammals ( Fig. 5 A). Each of these Wnt subtypes arose as one of the gene duplicates derived from WGD and has been maintained in at least one shark genome (see Fig. 5 B for the case of Wnt6b ). The Wnt11b orthologs were phylogenetically recognized and previously reported for reptiles and birds ( Kuraku and Kuratani, 2011 ). The Wnt7c gene was also previously recognized in Xenopus laevis ( Garriock et al., 2007 ) and is the only case in the Wnt gene family that exhibits three subtypes ( Wnt7a , Wnt7b , and Wnt7c ) duplicated in the vertebrate lineage (except for those derived from teleost fish lineage-specific duplications) that still exist currently. Wnt4b and Wnt6b have not been recognized as an ancient vertebrate subtype (except for those named for a teleost fish-specific duplicate), until the recent shark genome analysis ( Hara et al., 2018b ). It was previously suggested that a genomic cluster of several Wnt genes found in some invertebrates eroded during evolution, and is currently found as remnants containing only up to two Wnt genes in vertebrates ( Holstein, 2012 ). The Wnt6b gene in the bamboo shark is located between the Wnt1 and Wnt10b orthologs ( Hara et al., 2018b ), thus forming a 70 ​kbp-long trigene Wnt cluster that was identified for the first time in a vertebrate ( Fig. 5 C). The gene designated Wnt4b was previously identified in teleost fishes but was thought to be a duplicate unique to these fishes ( Liu et al., 2000 ). The coelacanth has also retained the respective orthologs of Wnt4b , Wnt6b , and Wnt7c , suggesting that these genes are not confined to a small subset of vertebrates and most likely existed in the vertebrate ancestor. These genes and the genomic linkage between them are intriguing targets of future studies in search of genomic factors accounting for phenotypic differences between these vertebrate lineages. 4.2 Cryptic pan-vertebrate genes: genes absent from multiple vertebrate lineages The author's group has identified and documented additional long-standing vertebrate genes that are expressed during development, with orthologs lost in humans and some traditional laboratory species; this group of genes was termed “cryptic pan-vertebrate genes” (reviewed in Kuraku et al., 2016 ). Many of the genes in this category, including FoxG2 , FoxG3 ( Hara et al., 2018a, 2018b ), Bmp16 ( Feiner et al., 2019 ), Nodal 2 ( Kajikawa et al., 2020 ), and Pax10 ( Feiner et al., 2014 ), have retained orthologs in at least one shark species. The numerous examples presented here may prompt researchers to adopt a genome-wide view that shark and ray genomes have preserved more genomic components from the vertebrate ancestor. This view seems to be consistent with the lack of additional WGD and the high conservation of the primary sequence compositions described above. It still needs to be examined by considering the gene loss frequency in the elasmobranch lineage, when high-quality genome sequences become available for multiple elasmobranch species in the future. The possible high gene retention in elasmobranch genomes could be explained by the reduced constraint in limiting the size of the genome—enlarged genomes could accommodate more genes, although the gene lengths per se make a minor contribution to the genome size. 5 Hox genes: proxy of the whole genome? 5.1 Well-conserved aspect: Hox A, B, and D clusters The cases described so far indicate a conservative nature for shark genomes. Then, what genomic change could have facilitated the morphological variation observed among cartilaginous fishes? One striking hint originated from comparative studies of Hox genes, harboring traditional themes related to the morphogenetic regulation of vertebrate body plans (reviewed in Mallo et al., 2010 ). Since the initial study reported in 2000 ( Kim et al., 2000 ), elasmobranch Hox A, B, and D genes have been identified as expected ( Oulion et al., 2010 ). The vertebrate Hox gene clusters tend to be approximately 100 ​kbp long ( Darbellay et al., 2019 ; Duboule, 2007 ), even in the enlarged shark genomes ( Hara et al., 2018b , Fig. 6 A and B). This genomic spacing constraint in Hox clusters, independent of the entire genome-wide landscape, will provide insights into the factors that determine the regional spacing and overall sizing of the genomes. 5.2 Hox C cluster: the unexpected in elasmobranch genomes The genome of the holocephalan C. milii harbors four Hox clusters (A−D), as expected from many other vertebrates ( Ravi et al., 2009 ). In elasmobranchs, Hox C genes have escaped comprehensive surveys, such as BAC library screenings ( Oulion et al., 2010 ) and transcriptome sequencing using RNA-seq ( Pascual-Anaya et al., 2018 ). This repeated unsuccess in the identification of shark and ray Hox C genes once prompted researchers to suggest a loss of the entire Hox C cluster in elasmobranchs ( King et al., 2011 )—note that no presentable whole-genome sequences were available for any elasmobranch species at this stage. It was not until 2018 that the elusive Hox C genes of elasmobranchs were identified and reported through whole-genome sequencing in multiple shark species ( Hara et al., 2018b , Fig. 6 A). Considering the technical details that resulted in gene (mis)identification, it seemed crucial to minimize the bias in library preparation and sequencing and perform exhaustive sequence searches in resultant fragments that are difficult to assemble. The Hox C genes identified to date ( Fig. 6 E) have a high GC-content, high synonymous substitution rates, and divergent amino acid sequences (see Fig. 6 D for the increased amino acid substitution rate of HoxC8 ; Hara et al., 2018b ). The genomic regions flanking those Hox C genes are also GC-rich, have few or no Hox genes in the vicinity, and harbor more repetitive elements ( Fig. 6 A; Hara et al., 2018b ). It should be verified using a high-quality reference assembly to examine if all putative Hox C genes of the brownbanded bamboo shark are located in a continuous genomic sequence. Some Hox C genes have been implicated in the specification of the anteroposterior identities of axial elements ( Jegalian and De Robertis, 1992 ; Pollock et al., 1992 ; reviewed in Wellik, 2009 ). Thus, it is of great interest to determine whether the potential variability of the retained members of the Hox C cluster ( Fig. 6 E) is associated with the morphological variation of elasmobranchs, such as the numbers and positions of fins and gill openings. Additionally, since the proposal of the entire loss of the elasmobranch Hox C cluster ( King et al., 2011 ), several studies were performed under the assumption that the whole Hox C cluster is completely lost (e.g., Jung et al., 2018 ; Oulion et al., 2011 ), and therefore these findings should now be reassessed. Some elasmobranch genomes have been sequenced using the single-molecule sequencing platform for producing long reads, which is thought to be free from GC bias; however, strangely, no Hox C genes have been found in these genome assemblies of the whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ; GCA_001642345.2, ASM164234v2), the thorny skate ( Amblyraja radiata ; GCA_010909765.1, sAmbRad1.pri; Rhie et al., 2021 ), and the small-spotted catshark ( Scyliorhinus canicula ; GCA_902713625.1, sScyCan1.1), according to a search performed by the author. The currently available elasmobranch genome assemblies have suboptimal continuity or lack a considerable proportion of the whole genome (up to 30%). This is expected to be improved by high-fidelity long-read sequencing that allows genome assembly of lengthy repetitive sequences abundant in elasmobranch genomes. 6 Conclusion Genomic studies of sharks and rays revealed the distinct trends of molecular evolution including the absence of genome duplications unique to their lineage as well as less derived gene repertoires and coding sequence compositions. These features particularly contrast with those of teleost fishes that underwent additional genome doubling and subsequent sequence divergence. Elasmobranch genomics have contributed to developmental biological studies from various viewpoints. Typical studies resort to focusing on the identification of individual genes, but are also expected to include additional genome-wide investigations, such as regulatory sequence functionality, transcriptome analysis (especially using single-cell technologies), and chromatin dynamics profiling.
