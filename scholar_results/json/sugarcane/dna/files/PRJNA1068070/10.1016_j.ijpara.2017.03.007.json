          "The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus , is a tick that parasitizes cattle in tropical and subtropical countries. This tick is a vector for several bovine diseases, harboring such infectious pathogens as Babesia bovis , Babesia bigemina , and Anaplasma marginale . The economic burdens caused by this parasite are enormous, impacting at levels from family farmers up to large cattle production operations ( de Castro, 1998 ). Annual losses attributed to this tick have been estimated to be over USD 2 billion and AUD 100 million for Brazil and Australia, respectively ( Angus, 1996; Grisi et al., 2002 ). The United States eradicated the cattle tick in the 20th century and the annual savings attributable to this eradication project have been estimated at USD 3 billion in 2015 dollar value ( Graham and Hourrigan, 1977 ). Global climate change has exacerbated the threat of the cattle tick reinfesting the United States and expansion of its range in other regions of the world.",
          "New countermeasures are needed to protect and enhance the productivity of livestock affected by the cattle tick and the diseases it transmits. The primary method of control implemented against the cattle tick centers upon applications of chemical acaricide to infested herds of cattle. However, R. microplus has developed economically significant levels of resistance to all the commercially available acaricides ( Andreotti et al., 2011; Rodriguez-Vivas et al., 2014 ) and there is a great need for the development of novel effective tick control technologies. Tick vaccines are an option for cattle tick control and in some cases the tick control efficacy of vaccination exceeded 99% ( Canales et al., 2009 ). However, the only commercially available tick vaccine suffers from variable efficacy against R. microplus and the search for new vaccines is ongoing.",
          "This need for novel tick control technology drove the initiation of a cattle tick genome sequencing project in 2005, beginning with acquisition of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) using Sanger protocols ( Guerrero et al., 2005 ) and determination of genome size by a reassociation kinetics-based approach ( Ullmann et al., 2005 ). The estimated genome size of 7.1 Gbp and the highly repetitive nature of the cattle tick R. microplus genome precluded full genome sequencing until the commercial maturation of second (e.g. Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and third generation (e.g. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), USA) sequencing technologies. In the meantime, the cattle tick R. microplus genome sequencing project focused upon elucidating sequences from the transcriptome ( Wang et al., 2007; Lew-Tabor et al., 2010 ) and unique low copy fraction of the genome ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). This incipient genome project enabled several reverse vaccinology approaches aimed at identification of target antigens in the cattle tick for tick vaccine development ( Guerrero et al., 2012; Maritz-Olivier et al., 2012 ).",
          "Ticks are believed to be among the earliest terrestrial arachnids, perhaps the first to develop blood-feeding capabilities ( Mans and Neitz, 2004 ). The Prostriata lineage of hard ticks is composed of a single genus, Ixodes , containing 243 species. Assembled tick genome sequences are currently available only for the Prostriate ticks, Ixodes scapularis ( Gulia-Nuss et al., 2016 ; https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/ixodes-scapularis ) and Ixodes ricinus ( Cramaro et al., 2015 ). Ixodes scapularis was sequenced using a Sanger whole genome shotgun approach and the I. ricinus genome was sequenced using Illumina 100 nucleotide (nt) paired-end reads. Both of these assemblies contain high numbers of scaffolds that could likely be further assembled with the aid of long reads. The Metastriata line of hard ticks consists of 13 genera and over 459 species, including many species of medical and veterinary importance across the genera Rhipicephalus , Hyalomma , Hemaphysalis, Amblyomma , and Dermacentor ( Guglielmone et al., 2010 ). The evolutionary distance between I. scapularis and the Metastriate ticks results in significant sequence divergence between orthologous genes, impeding molecular studies of the Metastriates. The persisting scientific and applied agricultural need for a Metastriate genome assembly drove the design and implementation of a hybrid genome sequencing/assembly approach for the R. microplus project. Initially, we acquired an Illumina- and 454-based blended draft-level genome assembly. This assembly composed primarily of contigs derived from the low-Cot unique DNA fraction was curated and published as part of the resources provided by the CattleTickBase ( Bellgard et al., 2012 ). However, the commercial introduction of the PacBio platform, offering single molecule real-time sequencing with long reads ( Eid et al., 2009 ), facilitated movement of the cattle tick R. microplus genome sequencing to the final phase tackling the complex repetitive regions of the genome.",
          "Our study reports the assembly and annotation of the 7.1 Gbp R. microplus genome. We generated long reads of very high molecular weight genomic DNA by PacBio protocols. A subset of these reads was error-corrected by an assembled set of Illumina-generated contigs sourced from genomic DNA purified by reassociation kinetics protocols to select for the unique low-copy genome fraction. Assembly programs were customized to take optimal advantage of Cloud-based computational resources, as the huge scope of the error-correction process exceeded the available super-computer resources in Australia. The genome was searched for microRNAs (miRNA) and the expansion of the numbers of known candidate miRNAs was significant. The transcriptome of R. microplus was mapped to the genome assembly and functional annotation identified metabolic pathway members and gene ontologies (GO)."

The Deutsch strain was started from a few individual engorged females collected from a 2001 tick outbreak in Webb County, TX, USA. Although the strain has been inbred since its collection and creation in 2001, it is not genetically homogeneous. A total of 10 g of eggs was used in a protocol from Sambrook et al. (1989) to purify very high molecular weight genomic DNA ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). The protocol consisted of pulverizing frozen material in a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle, addition to an aqueous buffer, followed by RNAse treatment, digestion by proteinase K, phenol extraction, and dialysis in 50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The resultant DNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis to be >200 kb. An aliquot of this genomic DNA was processed by Cot filtration to enrich for single, low copy, and moderately repetitive genomic DNA ( Guerrero et al., 2010 )."

(Pullman, WA, USA). The R. microplus BAC library was constructed from High Molecular Weight (HMW) genomic DNA processed at Amplicon Express, Inc. as previously described ( Tao and Zhang, 1998 ). HMW DNA was partially digested with the restriction enzyme Bam HI and size selected prior to ligation of fragments into the pECBAC1 vector and transformation of DH10B Escherichia coli host cells, which were then plated on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar with chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml), X-gal and isopropyl β- d -1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at appropriate concentrations. Clones were robotically picked with a Genetix QPIX (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) into 120 × 384-well plates containing LB freezing media. Plates were incubated for 16 h, replicated and then frozen at −80 °C. DNA from 28 random BAC clones was digested with 5 U of Not I enzyme for 3 h at 37 °C. The digestion products were separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (CHEF-DRIII system, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a 1% agarose gel in TBE. Insert sizes were compared with those of the Lambda Ladder MidRange I PFG Marker (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Electrophoresis was carried out for 18 h at 14 °C with an initial switch time of 5 s, a final switch time of 15 s, in a voltage gradient of 6 V/cm.

              "Focused Genome Sequencing (FGS) was used to sequence 18,432 randomly selected R. microplus BAC clones. FGS is a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) method developed at Amplicon Express that allows high quality assembly and scaffolding of BAC clone sequence data generated on the Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina, Inc.). Individual BAC clones were made into Pools and Superpools according to US Patent 8301388 (Amplicon Express, Inc., Pullman,; www.google.com/patents/US8301388 ). BAC DNA was prepared using a standard alkaline lysis procedure ( Sambrook and Russell, 2001 ). Pooled BAC DNA was resuspended in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 at a high concentration and mechanically sheared to fragment sizes of 170 bp, 400 bp, 800 bp, 2,000 bp and 4,000 bp using a GeneMachines Hydroshear (San Carlos, CA, USA) and SonicMan (Spokane, WA, USA) technologies to achieve the respective sizes. Illumina libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq to an average depth of 100× coverage. The gapped contiguous sequences were ordered and orientated using Mira mapping software in conjunction with ALLPATH-LG taking into account various Illumina library sizes. Illumina libraries of insert sizes 170 bp, 400 bp, 800 bp, 2,000 bp and 4,000 bp were used on each pool of BAC DNA. The sequence reads were made into contigs and scaffolds using Mira and ALLPATHS-LG. Data from the assembled pools were deconvoluted using lookup tables based on the Pool and Superpool Matrix scheme. Unique sequence reads were deconvoluted with specific Illumina tags and mapped back to specific BAC clone addresses. Repeat elements were traced to BAC clone “sets” that share common repeats and sizes of the gaps caused by repeats were determined using ALLPATHS-LG output files. The FGS process makes NGS tagged libraries of BAC clones and generates a consensus sequence of the BAC clones with all reads assembled at ∼80 bp overlap and ∼98% identity."

              "Raw SMRT PacBio reads were error corrected as described by Au et al. (2012) using the Illumina reads generated from the Cot-selected genomic DNA. Large single copy (LSC) scripts for PacBio error correction were modified to reduce the size of intermediate files, which is a significant bottleneck when using large input datasets. The PacBio error correction was found to be very computationally intensive. Initially, we utilized the EPIC supercomputer resource at Murdoch University, Australia, which is an 87.2 TeraFLOPS system comprised of 9600 processors and 500 Tb of storage. However, small-scale error correction jobs allowed us to project that the entire error correction process would require over 4 months with the entire computer resource dedicated to this project and would be cost-prohibitive. Subsequently, it became obvious that cloud resources were required and a prioritizing of the PacBio sequences for error correction was also necessary. We benchmarked and designed a massive parallel approach to error correct up to 2,000 PacBio reads per job via an Amazon cloud computing service. Owing to the computational demand for the error correction process, only PacBio reads ≥5,000 nt were error corrected as this subset of the longest PacBio reads would provide the most valuable information to close gaps and expand the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly. Of note is that error correction of PacBio reads using LSC is limited by the alignment of short Illumina reads. PacBio reads with no aligned Illumina reads are not error corrected, while those with limited Illumina read coverage, the error correction takes place only between the foremost 5′-end to the foremost 3′-end mapped reads on the PacBio sequence. Either 5′-end and/or 3′-end terminal regions of a PacBio read without mapped Illumina reads will be trimmed during the error correction process ( Au et al., 2012 )."

              "The assembly strategy is depicted in Fig. 1 . We drew from four sources of genome sequence data: (i) the existing assembled contigs of 454-sequenced Cot-selected genomic DNA contained in Rmi v1.0 ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ), (ii) HiSeq reads from the Cot-selected DNA, (iii) reads from the Illumina-based shotgun sequencing of the 18,432 randomly selected BACs, and (iv) PacBio reads of unselected genomic DNA ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The Cot-selected Illumina raw reads were quality trimmed using ConDeTri version 2.2 ( Smeds and Kunstner, 2011 ), then de novo assembled using SOAPdenovo2 version 2.04-r240 ( Luo et al., 2012 ) and Ray version 2.3.1 ( Boisvert et al., 2010 ). Redundancy of contigs from the data derived from the BACs, Cot-selected genomic DNA, and Rmi v1.0 was removed using CD-HIT ( Fu et al., 2012 ) and/or BLAT ( Kent, 2002 ) sequence clustering and comparisons, respectively ( Fig. 1 ). Resulting Illumina scaffolds were aligned to individual error-corrected PacBio reads using BLASTN. Error-corrected PacBio reads with alignment ≥200 bp and identity ≥90% to scaffolds were used to join Illumina scaffolds using PBJelly2 (PBSuite_15.8.24; English et al., 2012 ). Finally, error-corrected PacBio reads were de novo assembled using CANU ( Berlin et al., 2015 ), a new PacBio assembler based on the Celera assembler ( Myers et al., 2000 ). CANU utilises the MinHash Alignment Process (MHAP) for overlapping noisy, long reads using probabilistic, locality-sensitive hashing. In assembling the cleaned reads, a high MHAP sensitivity and low minimum coverage of 2× was set along with a high error rate of 0.12. We ran a shortened CANU pipeline, only running at the ‘assemble option’, as the reads have already been error-corrected. The process depicted in Fig. 1 produced the R. microplus assembly designated as Rmi v2.0.",

These non-redundant sequences were then parsed using RepeatMasker v4.0.5 ( http://www.repeatmasker.org/ ) to identify repeat containing sequences. Transcripts encoding repeats were discarded, leaving 43,874 non-redundant R. microplus transcripts for ab initio predictions. These filtered transcripts were provided to MAKER ( Cantarel et al., 2008 ) as ‘EST’ evidence to generate a R. microplus ‘training set’ for ab initio programs. SNAP ( Korf, 2004 ) or AUGUSTUS ( Stanke et al., 2006 ) were then trained and their resulting predicted gene models were used as a ‘refined gene model training set’ to re-run these tools. The predicted refined gene models by both SNAP ( Korf, 2004 ) and AUGUSTUS ( Stanke et al., 2006 ) were then combined and used to re-run MAKER to identify R. microplus gene loci. MAKER identified 67,982 putative gene loci that were then filtered to < 0.5 Annotation Edit Distance (AED), yielding 8,084 gene loci supported by 8,645 gene isoforms. The gene isoform with the lowest AED value was selected as the representative sequence for each locus ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).",
              "To identify additional R. microplus gene loci that may have been missed by the ab initio pipelines, we mapped the 63,416 non-redundant R. microplus transcripts onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly using BLAT ( Kent, 2002 ) with at least 95% sequence identity and over 50% sequence coverage. A total of 30,301 non-redundant R. microplus transcripts mapped onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly and then parsed using RepeatMasker as described above ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Three filtering strategies were applied to mapped transcripts: (i) transcripts with no repeat content were re-aligned onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly using BLAT with ≥95% nt sequence identity and ≥50% sequence coverage; (ii) transcripts with ≥50% repeat content were discarded as these are not typical mRNA sequences and owing to the ambiguous mapping of their repeat regions; and (iii) mapped transcripts containing less than 50% repeats were evaluated for their protein coding potential using TransDecoder v3.0 ( Tang et al., 2015 ). Transcripts with Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of at least 100 amino acids (aa) were re-aligned onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly with ≥95% sequence identity and ≥50% sequence coverage. To increase the mapping accuracy of transcripts lacking an ORF ≥100 aa, these were re-aligned onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly with ≥99% sequence identity and ≥90% sequence coverage. The genomic sequences of mapped transcripts passing the above filtering steps were concatenated and converted to GFF format using Blat2GFF ( http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu:8081/gmod/tandy/blat2gff.pl ). Subsequently these transcripts were clustered and merged using Gffread v2.2.1 (Cufflinks suite v2.2.1). A representative sequence for each locus was then selected using the following filtering criteria: (i) largest number of exons; (ii) highest BLAT bit score; and (iii) longest alignment length ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).",
              "Finally, representative sequences from both ab initio predicted gene loci and transcript-mapping evidence supported gene loci were merged using Gffread v2.2.1. A representative gene sequence for each merged and non-redundant gene locus was then selected based on the following criteria: (a) encodes the largest number of exons; (b) has the lowest AED score; and/or (c) has the highest BLAT bit score. Representative gene sequences were then rerun using Gffread to define their genomic coordinates. A fraction of the RNA-seq data used in this study was not stranded, resulting in possible isoforms mapping to both sense and antisense strands on the same genomic region. To remove duplicates encoding the same ORF we used BEDTools intersect (v2.26.0) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 ) to identify sense-antisense pairs and then their encoded ORFs were evaluated. Sense-antisense pairs encoding the same ORF were further assessed to remove ‘duplicated’ loci with a conflicting ORF orientation ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). As a final step, representative gene loci sequences were subjected to TransDecoder analysis to identify ORF ≥100 aa and classify identified protein coding genes into ‘complete’, ‘5prime partial’, ‘internal’ or ‘3prime partial’ proteins. Gene loci with an ORF shorter than 100 aa may encode non-coding RNAs or represent partial fragments of protein coding genes."

              "The large size and the repetitive nature of the R. microplus genome imposed significant difficulties upon the assembly process as we sought to incorporate the repetitive fraction of the genome into the assembly. The first R. microplus genome assembly, Rmi v1.0 ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ), focused only upon the low-copy/unique fraction of the genome, as it utilized Cot-selected (to remove the repetitive DNA fraction) genomic DNA for sequencing upon the 454 platform. Sequencing the R. microplus genome wholly by the long read PacBio platform was cost-prohibitive within our available resources, thus we adopted a hybrid approach. Koren et al. (2012) reported the sequencing of the 1.2 Gbp parrot genome using a 3.8× PacBio coverage strategy supplemented with a 15.4 × 454-based coverage and error correction of the PacBio reads using a 54× coverage Illumina paired end read data set. We set these parameters as our goals for coverage of the R. microplus genome. To obtain sequence information over the entire genome, we utilized two approaches. First, we sequenced unselected very high molecular weight R. microplus genomic DNA with PacBio to a coverage of 4.6×. Second, we sequenced 18,432 BAC clones from a BAC library prepared from unselected R. microplus genomic DNA using an Illumina-based pooling and reassembly method (FGS). This BAC-based data set produced 0.24× coverage of the genome. To acquire the data set for error correcting the PacBio reads, we sequenced Cot-selected genomic DNA with Illumina HiSeq to a coverage of 15.84×. We wished to focus resources available for error correction upon the gene-rich regions of the genome. This drove our decision to use the HiSeq technology on genomic DNA that had been selected with the Cot technique, as it is enriched for the unique and less repetitive DNA fraction, rather than whole genome-derived DNA. Supplementary Table S1 contains the raw statistics for these sequencing datasets.",
              "Fig. 2 shows the read length distributions for the 13,909,582 PacBio reads. There are 1,446,530 reads ≥5,000 nt and these contain over 10.3 Gbp of sequence data comprising 1.46× genome coverage ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We selected the PacBio reads ≥5,000 nt for error correction using the Cot-selected genomic DNA Illumina sequence data set for this purpose. As the error correction process relies upon alignment to the Illumina short reads, PacBio reads that have no alignment to the short reads will be excluded from the error correction. Trimming also occurs during the error correction, as described below. Losses due to trimming and lack of alignment to short reads resulted in a final output from the error correction process of 1,389,498 reads encoding a total of 7,633,231,856 bases representing a genome coverage of 1.08× ( Supplementary Table S1 ).",
              "During the error correction process with LSC ( Au et al., 2012 ), 5′ and 3′ ends of PacBio reads that are not covered by Illumina reads are trimmed and the output error corrected PacBio reads have lost sequence information. In our error correction process, approximately 78% of the error corrected PacBio reads retained at least 70% of their original length ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). It is possible that a higher percentage of PacBio read length could have been preserved had the Illumina data been generated from unselected genomic DNA rather than the Cot-selected fraction. However, the unselected genomic DNA consists of ∼70% repetitive DNA and it is not clear how the LSC algorithm would handle this type of short read data. Au et al. (2012) reported on LSC in the context of isoform assembly of RNASeq data, which does not typically contain large, highly repetitive sequence regions. This would be an interesting topic for future studies. Another possible route to an assembled genome would be through obtaining a high genome coverage solely from PacBio sequencing. PacBio errors are reported to be randomly distributed ( Eid et al., 2009 ) and sufficient coverage should allow PacBio read redundancy to “self-correct” and produce a highly accurate assembled genome. At the time we acquired our sequence data sets, the yield of PacBio SMRT II technology was not sufficient to allow this approach to be cost-effective.",
              "Following error correction, the 1,389,498 error corrected PacBio reads were screened with the merged scaffolds dataset ( Fig. 1 ) using BLASTN, generating a set of 1,254,669 reads with a total of 7,609,790,717 nt (1.07× coverage) that had significant sequence similarity to the merged scaffolds. The Rmi v1.0 scaffolds, Illumina scaffolds, and these PacBio reads were assembled with the merged scaffold dataset using PBJelly2 ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Subsequent to the PBJelly2 assembly, there were 448,651 error corrected PacBio reads that did not assemble. Those remaining 448,651 error corrected PacBio reads were assembled with CANU ( Berlin et al., 2015 ). The resulting CANU scaffolds and singletons were combined with the PBJelly2 scaffolds to create the resulting R. microplus assembly, designated Rmi v2.0. This genome assembly is composed of 280,135 contigs in 195,170 scaffolds (N50 = 60,284 bp) representing 2.0 Gbp, including 3.01% of Ns (61.9 Mbp) incorporated into the assembled scaffolds ( Table 1 ). This assembly is a substantial improvement over the first R. microplus genome assembly encoding a total of 144.6 Mbp with an N50 of 825 bp ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). In our present study, we aimed at preferentially enriching and sequencing gene-rich regions of the R. microplus genome. The remaining ∼5Gbp of unassembled regions of the R. microplus genome are anticipated to consist of 60–80% fraction of repeat elements and portions of gene loci that have been partially assembled or missing in the Rmi v2.0 assembly (see Section 3.2 )."

              "Similar to I. scapularis , the R. microplus genome has been determined to consist of ∼70% repetitive DNA ( Ullmann et al., 2005 ). Table 2 shows that the overall repeat content of the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly was 51.44%. This fraction represents 14.56% of the entire R. microplus genome (see Section 3.4 ). Class I transposable elements represented the largest fraction of repeat elements accounting for 28.37% of our genome assembly, while Unclassified, simple repeats and Class II transposable elements encoded 18.16%, 2.21% and 2.12% of the Rmi v2.0 assembly, respectively. The most abundant Class I repeat elements are long interspersed nuclear repeats (LINEs) (11.64%) and long terminal repeats (LTRs) (9.74), while short interspersed nuclear repeats (SINEs) and Class II DNA elements account for 7.00% and 1.66% of our R. microplus genome assembly, respectively. Among the SINE elements, we found that the Ruka small interspersed element comprised 69% of the SINE content. The Ruka element was previously found to be specific to ixodid tick species including Rhipicephalus appendiculatus , R. microplus, Amblyomma variegatum and I. scapularis ( Sunter et al., 2008 ). The longest repetitive element in the R. microplus assembly was a 55,684 bp simple repeat sequence, (CTAT) n , which was contained in positions 3,396 to 59,680 in a 82,162 bp long genomic scaffold (RMI_v2_068324). The repeat content of subsets of datasets generated for this study are shown in Supplementary Table S4 .",
              "Our three Cot-selected datasets, derived from genomic DNA selected for the unique and low copy fractions of the genome, contain 24.6% (454 low-Cot data; Rmi v1.0), 28.4% (Illumina low-Cot; Ray assembly) and 32.2% (Illumina low-Cot; SOAPdenovo assembly), while our two whole genome shotgun datasets, the BAC and PacBio CANU assembled datasets, contain 59.75% and 60.0% repeat elements, respectively ( Supplementary Table S4 ). Our findings that the genome, as reflected by the BAC and PacBio datasets, contained 54% to 60% repeat element content is generally consistent with the re-association kinetics-based result of ∼70% repetitive DNA in the R. microplus genome. There is the possibility that repeat-rich regions may comprise a larger fraction of the R. microplus genome than our data indicates, as these elements may have been collapsed into fewer highly similar repeat elements during the assembly process. Additionally, our PacBio dataset used to produce Rmi v2.0 is biased toward the less repetitive fraction of the genome, since our error correction Illumina data was derived from Cot-selected DNA. Thus, our estimate of 54–60% repeat element content for the R. microplus genome is likely a conservative figure ( Table 2 ).",
              "Gulia-Nuss et al. (2016) reported that 16.7% of the I. scapularis genome consisted of transposable elements, including Non-LTR retrotransposons, DNA transposons, and LTR retrotransposons that comprised 6.7%, 3.06%, and 0.64% of that tick's genome, respectively. Comparing the repeats found in the R. microplus genome with those reported in the I. scapularis genome, we found there is a larger fraction of the R. microplus genome as LTR retrotransposons (2.76%), and a lower fraction of DNA transposons (0.47%). The LTR retrotransposon Gypsy has over 233,000 copies in the R. microplus Rmi v2.0 assembly while the I. scapularis genome contains approximately 29,000 copies. As Gypsy is known to be infectious in invertebrates ( Kim et al., 1994 ), the role of the retrotransposon in R. microplus genome evolution would be an interesting topic for further study. Nystedt et al. (2013) reported the Norway spruce genome size estimate of 19.6 Gbp, with 58% of the genome consisting of LTR retrotransposons and 35% of this consisting of Gypsy repeat elements. The large genome size of the Norway spruce and other conifers was proposed to be due to expansions of LTR elements such as Gypsy combined with conifers' inefficient mechanisms to inactivate and remove transposable elements from their genomes."

              "To estimate genome completeness, we examined the 38,827 putative Rmi v2.0 gene loci described above for highly conserved single-copy protein coding genes that are found in nearly all arthropods using BUSCO analysis software ( Simao et al., 2015 ). BUSCO indicated 40.1% genome completeness based on 2,675 ancestral proteins used in the analysis ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Among the identified ancestral arthropod genes found by BUSCO there were 794 (29.7%) and 278 (10.4%) R. microplus gene loci classified as complete and fragments, respectively ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). These findings generally correlate with the current length of the Rmi v2.0 assembly (2.0 Gbp) that represents ∼28% of the estimated 7.1 Gbp R. microplus genome.",
              "We refined our BUSCO analysis to attempt to find more of the missing 1,603 (59.9% of the total BUSCO genes) ancestral arthropod genes in the Rmi v2.0 assembly. It is possible that Metastriate ticks such as R. microplus possess genes with distant sequence similarity to the BUSCO ancestral set. It is also possible that the selective low-Cot DNA sequencing approach may result in partial assembly of gene loci such that our BUSCO analysis missed those. Additionally, the RNA-seq datasets used in this study may not encompass the expression of all R. microplus counterparts to ancestral proteins and/or the stringency of the computational pipeline resulted in the identification of only a limited fraction of the corresponding ancestral gene loci ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). To evaluate whether any of the missing ancestral arthropod proteins could be found in our RNA-seq dataset, we subjected our 63,416 non-redundant R. microplus transcriptome dataset, described earlier and in Supplementary Table S2 , to BUSCO analysis. We identified hits to 2,274 ancestral proteins (85.01% of the total BUSCO ancestral arthropod gene dataset) with only 401 ancestral proteins (∼15% of the total BUSCO dataset) missing in our R. microplus transcriptome dataset ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). This result suggests that R. microplus counterparts to ancestral proteins are not highly divergent in sequence, but more likely the 1,603 ancestral proteins missing in our Rmi v2.0 genome assembly might be due to a lack of scaffolds encoding these ancestral proteins and/or existing scaffolds accounting for less than 50% coverage of the BUSCO gene sequences. We re-aligned 1,919 RNA-seq transcripts that had not aligned onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly and had hits to 1,125 of the 1,603 missing BUSCO ancestral proteins ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). We also lowered the transcript alignment coverage threshold to ≥30%, to help identify partial gene loci on the Rmi v2.0 assembly for these transcripts. We found partial mapping positions for 507 of these R. microplus transcripts onto 445 putative genomic locations on the Rmi v2.0 assembly ( Supplementary Table S7 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). These partially mapped transcripts have hits to 349 missing ancestral arthropods genes ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Thus, combining results from both BUSCO analyses, we have identified 1421 hits to BUSCO arthropods ancestral proteins (53.1% of the total BUSCO dataset) based on 24,758 protein coding gene loci identified in Rmi v2.0 and 445 from our partial mapping strategy.

Among the top overrepresented KEGG pathways in R. microplus we found a 12-fold, 11-fold and eightfold increase in genes assigned to the ‘Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction’, TGF-beta signalling pathway and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, while I. scapularis showed 1.6-fold increase in genes assigned to the Notch signalling pathway ( Supplementary Fig. S5B ). Comparison of genes involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor identified two and a single putative ‘Partitioning-defective 3-like beta’ ( PAR3B ) gene in the Rmi v2.0 (Rmi_v2_LOC_023216.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_023217.1) and IscaW1 (XP_002404429.1) genome assemblies, respectively. We also found two putative PAR3 isoform X11 genes in R. microplus (Rmi_v2_LOC_023009.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_023010.1) encoded in the same genomic region as sense-antisense transcripts. Owing to the lack of strand information in the RNA-seq datasets used in the gene loci prediction approaches, caution needs to be exercised when evaluating sense-antisense genes with non-identical ORFs. Assessment of annotated putative R. microplus PAR3B and PAR3X11 genes for both gene locus and their encoded ORF orientation shows that there is likely a single PAR3B (Rmi_v2_LOC_023217.1) and PARX11 (Rmi_v2_LOC_023010.1) gene in Rmi v2.0 genome assembly. The I. scapularis IscaW1 genome assembly was not reported to encode a PAR3X11 gene. The diverse PAR3 gene family has been shown to play a role in asymmetrical cell division and direct polarized cell growth from nematodes to vertebrates ( Kohjima et al., 2002 ).",
              "Another key difference found is the lack of a putative ‘Glutamate receptor’ in I. scapularis , while in the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly we identified four putative metabotropic glutamate receptors (Rmi_v2_LOC_007400.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_019725.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_019727.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_034524.1) with most of them being classified as ‘Complete’ proteins by TransDecoder. Glutamate receptors are synaptic receptors located primarily on the membranes of neuronal cells including the larval neuromuscular junction ( Thomas and Sigrist, 2012 ). The use of glutamate receptor inhibitors against insect skeletal muscle glutamate receptors has been suggested as a potential insecticide. It remains to be elucidated whether one or more of the putative R. microplus glutamate receptors identified in this study is uniquely expressed in skeletal muscle, providing new opportunities for the controlling R. microplus populations.",
              "The AutoFACT program assigned cluster of orthologous genes (COG) annotation to 4,143 transcripts that mapped onto the Rmi v2.0 assembly ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Comparison of R. microplus COG annotation against that of I. scapularis identified a 13.7 and 4.3-fold increase in ‘Replication, recombination and repair’ and ‘Chromatin structure and dynamics’, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S5C ). Among the gene loci with COG annotation of ‘Replication, recombination and repair function’, we found 305, 147 and 132 genes annotated as ‘gag-pol fusion proteins’, ‘putative reverse transcriptase’ and ‘rve-domain containing protein’, respectively. Inspection of gag-pol fusion protein gene loci show that most of them represent partial sequences, while only 33 gag-pol fusion proteins were classified as ‘complete’ by TransDecoder ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). BLASTP comparison of the complete gap-pol fusion proteins against a reference Rhizophagus irregularis gag-pol fusion protein (EXX59955.1) revealed that 25 putative R. microplus gag-pol proteins had varying degrees of similarity to the reference EXX59955.1 gag-pol protein, highlighting that these were divergent and likely to represent independent genome-insertion events of tick viral sequences ( Supplementary Table S8 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). The abundant repertoire of viral-like sequences in R. microplus may facilitate its innate antiviral response via the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery that is common to insects and plants ( Gammon and Mello, 2015; Barrero et al., 2017 ).",
              "Supplementary Fig. S6 shows a substantial increase in R. microplus gene loci with Gene Ontology (GO) annotation in Rmi v2.0 compared with the Rmi v1.0 release ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). Rmi v1.0 had 338 genes with GO annotation while Rmi v2.0 contains 9,169 genes with GO annotation, showing a significant increase in nearly all annotated cellular component, molecular function and biological process GO categories ( Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S9 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Supplementary Fig. S6 depicts a comparison of R. microplus GO genome-wide annotations against that of I. scapularis which contains GO codes assigned to 6,142 protein coding genes. Notably we found a 5.47, 5.0, 4.13 and 3.96-fold increase in ‘protein-DNA complex’, ‘DNA packing’, ‘chromatin binding’ and ‘nucleic acid binding’ GO codes in R. microplus Rmi v2.0 compared with I. scapularis IscaW1 ( Supplementary Tables S9, S10 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). One of the key families of proteins accounting for the observed differences between R. microplus and I. scapulari s is histone proteins ( Supplementary Table S10 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). We identified 58 histone proteins in R. microplus including 45 predicted to encode a complete ORF by TransDecoder ( Tang et al., 2015 ) ( Supplementary Table S10 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Among the complete histone proteins we found eight, eight and 29 annotated as H2A, H3 and H4, respectively, while in I. scapularis were identified one, four, three and three proteins annotated as H1, H2A, H2B and H3, respectively ( Supplementary Table S10 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Evolutionary relationship analysis of H2 and H3 proteins commonly found in the two tick species, showed that R. microplus encodes three clusters of histone H2 proteins, one (Rmi_v2_LOC_036667.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_036900, Rmi_v2_LOC_023192.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_03694.1) clustering with I. scapularis H2A (XP_002403551.1) and another (Rmi_v2_LOC_001119.1) with I. scapularius H2B (XP_002436057.1 and XP_002400137.1) proteins, while the third cluster (Rmi_v2_LOC_036898.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_012238.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_017065.1) is more divergent ( Supplementary Fig. S6A ). Similarly, annotated histone 3 (H3) proteins also show three phylogenetic branches, where Rmi_v2_LOC_036654.1 is the more divergent H3 protein ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ). Variants of nuclear core histones H2A and H3 have been reported to have specific functions in the regulation of gene expression and genome stability ( Yukawa et al., 2014 ). Our findings in R. microplus correlates with the sequence diversity of H2A and H3 found in other species.",
              "Absence of an R. microplus histone H1, a gene family known to be highly variable across species that is involved in the establishment of pericentric heterochromatin and normal chromatic structure in D. melanogaster ( Lu et al., 2009 ), maybe due to the partial Rmi v2.0 genome assembly. Interestingly, we found a large expansion of the histone H4 family in R. microplus , which is histone family that is lost in the I. scapularis lineage ( Gulia-Nuss et al., 2016 ). Mutations in the yeast histone H4 in which all four tail lysines are replaced by glutamines cause a pronounced defect in genome integrity owing to failure to repair damaged DNA ( Bird et al., 2002 ). The significantly larger genome of R. microplus (∼7.1 Gbp) compared with I. scapularis (2.1 Gbp) may potentially explain the need for a large repertoire of histone H4 proteins."

              "Previously we reported the finding of 87 R. microplus miRNA loci ( Barrero et al., 2011a ) using the genomes of I. scapularis , D. melanogaster and the Rmi v1.0 assembly derived solely from Cot-selected R. microplus genome sequences. Only 24 of the precursor sequences for the 87 predicted R. microplus miRNAs could be found in the Rmi v1.0 assembly. With the significant increase in the content of the R. microplus assembly from Rmi v1.0 (0.15 Gbp) to Rmi v2.0 (2.0 Gbp), we reanalyzed the R. microplus genome using Rmi v2.0 to identify miRNA loci, using small RNA libraries derived from R. australis (formerly known as R. microplus ) life stages (egg, larvae, frustrated larvae exposed to the host but not allowed to feed, adult females and males) and selected adult female ticks organs (salivary glands, midgut, and ovaries). miRNAs are highly conserved throughout evolution facilitating the use of genomes from related species and/or small RNA datasets to discover miRNA loci in a species of interest ( Barrero et al., 2011a ). We found 191 non-redundant R. microplus miRNAs in the Rmi v2.0 assembly ( Supplementary Table S11 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Of these, 169 (88.5%) and 22 (11.5%) miRNAs have sequence similarity to known miRNAs ( Barrero et al., 2011a ) or represent novel tick microRNA loci, respectively. Previously we identified 24 R. microplus miRNA precursors in the Rmi v1.0 genome assembly ( Barrero et al., 2011a ). Additionally, the mature sequences for other 63 miRNAs were found by using the D. melanogaster and I. scapularis genomes ( Barrero et al., 2011a ). Thus, the finding of 191 miRNA loci in the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly represents a substantial improvement. Evaluation of the expression profiles of these microRNAs discovered that 143 and 93 were expressed in our life stage and adult tick samples, respectively ( Fig. 3 ). The majority of the identified microRNAs show specific expression restricted to either one specific life stage ( Fig. 3 A), sex or adult female organ ( Fig. 3 B). This contrasts with our previous report ( Barrero et al., 2011a ), where most of the identified R. microplus miRNAs were found expressed in multiple life stages and/or organs. In that previous study, owing to the small and incomplete nature of the Rmi v1.0 R. microplus genome assembly, we relied upon the I. scapularis (IscaW1.0) and D. melanogaster genomes for miRNA prediction in R. microplus . We had also imposed the requirement to only report miRNAs that were expressed in at least two independent small RNA libraries. Thus, our previous findings were likely biased towards evolutionarily conserved miRNAs. The identification of life stage-specific and/or organ-specific cattle tick miRNAs provides new opportunities for investigating the role of miRNAs in tick gene expression and development."

The various proteome sizes are listed in Table 4 . Comparison of shared protein families was conducted using OrthoMCL ( Li et al., 2003 ). This analysis clustered 415,232 protein-coding genes into 36,405 protein families ( Table 5 ). We found a core set of 1,254 protein families shared amongst all species included in our analysis ( Table 5 ). The core set of protein families contains 47,031 proteins. Within this core protein set, there were 2,405 and 1,604 R. microplus and I. scapularis proteins representing 9.43% and 7.84% of their proteome content, respectively ( Table 4 ). Interestingly, the species with the largest proportion of its proteome as part of the core set was A. mellifera with 15.70% of its protein sequences. Our results suggest that 8% - 9% of tick genes are conserved since the Nephrozoan (640 million years ago) ancestor ( Barrero et al., 2011a ).",

            "paragraphs": [
              "Increased esterase activity in arthropods is considered an important biochemical marker of pesticide resistance. In the R. microplus , esterases were found associated with resistance to both organophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid pesticides ( Rosario-Cruz et al., 2009 ). Temeyer and colleagues reported the limited aa sequence similarities among the three characterized acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) from R. microplus ( Temeyer et al., 2004 ). More recently, 27 esterase-like transcripts were found in R. microplus transcriptome datasets ( Bendele et al., 2015 ). We found 31 R. microplus gene loci with similarity to AChE as indicated by the AutoFACT description ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ); of these 13 gene loci were assessed by TransDecoder as encoding complete proteins ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). AChEs are large proteins encoding an average ∼600 aa; the shortest annotated AChE in I. scapularis encodes 464 aa (XP_002409706.1). Of the 13 R. microplus gene loci predicted to encode ‘complete’ AChEs, only eight have an ORF larger than 500 aa, while the remaining five gene loci encoded AChEs with an ORF shorter than 370 aa. These findings highlight the need to take with caution the ORF classification assigned using TransDecoder. To provide insights into the exon–intron structures and functional domains of R. microplus AChEs four divergent gene loci (Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1) were selected and evaluated. Our results show significant gene structure diversity in terms of location of the ORF and size of both exon and introns ( Fig. 4 ). Despite such gene structure divergence, these esterases are predicted to have similar protein secondary and tertiary structures ( Supplementary Fig. S8 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). We also evaluated the conservation of functional domains in these putative esterases by comparing them against published AChE protein sequences ( Baxter and Barker, 1999; Bendele et al., 2015 ). We found the active site serine (S), glutamate (E) and histidine (H) that form the AChE catalytic triad are conserved in Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1, but not in Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1 ( Supplementary Fig. S9 ). Additionally, aas predicted to form part of the substrate-binding pocket and post-translational modification motifs showed variability among all sequences suggesting that these esterases may undergo distinct post-translational modification events.",
              "Interestingly, we found that the proteins encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000816.1 harbour a signal peptide in their N-terminal region, while no such domain was found in the ORF encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1 ( Supplementary Fig. S10 ). To gain insight into the possible function of Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1, we conducted a BLASTP screening against a manually curated Swiss-Prot human database. We identified a Butyrylcholine esterase (P06276) as its top hit with 32% sequence identity and 81% query coverage. This finding contrasts with the top match found in the Swiss-Protein database for proteins encoded by the Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 representative gene sequences. The Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 protein showed 34% protein sequence similarity and 95% query coverage to a human AChE protein (accession number P04058), while the Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 encoded-protein had 30% protein sequence similarity and 90% query coverage to a different the human AChE (GenBank accession number Q27677 ). Thus, both Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000816.1 transcripts and their corresponding gene loci appear to encode secreted R. microplus AChEs.",

We found that the AChE encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 is part of a sister branch to R. microplus AChE1 ( Bendele et al., 2015 ). Curiously, the esterase encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1 is placed as an outgroup for the AChE protein encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 and other I. scapularis proteins annotated as acetylcholinesterases ( Supplementary Fig. S11 ). The putative AChE encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1 showed closer similarity to an I. scapularis AChE (XP_002402742.1) protein and a cluster of R. microplus AChE3 proteins. Overall our findings highlight the significant diversity of AChE gene-structures that can be utilised to design targeted control strategies to impair tick OP resistance."

Despite having similar gene locus sizes, both putative R. microplus CYP41 genes show distinct exon–intron structures ( Supplementary Fig. S12 ), suggesting that they were not acquired via a tandem segmental duplication ( Gotoh, 1993 ). Phylogenetic analysis of R. microplus CYP genes together with known counterparts in Daphnia , honeybee and Drosophila, showed agreement with previous studies reporting four major CYP clans for arthropod species ( Baldwin et al., 2009 ) ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S13 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ).

Interestingly, we found that one of the R. microplus CYP41 (Rmi_v2_LOC_001287.1) and one R. microplus CYP3A (Rmi_v2_LOC_035583.1) protein lack the PERF domain ( Supplementary Fig. S15 ).

We used CASTp ( http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/ ) to estimate the area and volume of predicted structural pockets in selected CY3A and CYP41 proteins. We found that proteins lacking the PERF motif (Rmi_v2_LOC_001287 and Rmi_v2_LOC_035583) and/or substrate-biding sites in the N-terminal region of the CYP protein (Rmi_v2_LOC_002156, Rmi_v2_LOC_007826 and Rmi_v2_LOC_35583) were predicted to have a large solvent accessible surface (SA mean volume = 3,249 Å 3 ± 345.3; n = 4) and molecular surface (MS mean volume = 7,751.9 Å 2 ± 107.45; n = 4) ( Supplementary Table S14 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 , and Supplementary Fig. S15 ). In contrast, Rmi_v2_LOC_001286 (CYP41) and other R. microplus CYP3A proteins harbouring a PERF motif and substrate binding sites in their N-terminal region have a substantially smaller solvent accessible surface (SA mean volume = 800 Å 3 ± 75.1; n = 6) and molecular surface (MS mean volume = 3,578.6 Å 2 ± 328.1; n = 6) ( Supplementary Table S14 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 , and Supplementary Fig. S15 ).

It remains to be elucidated if the new R. microplus CYP41 (Rmi_v2_LOC_001286.1) gene found in this study with an estimated solvent accessible surface volume of 897.3 Å 3 could bind coumaphos and mediate OP resistance.",

    "full_text": "1 Introduction The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus , is a tick that parasitizes cattle in tropical and subtropical countries. This tick is a vector for several bovine diseases, harboring such infectious pathogens as Babesia bovis , Babesia bigemina , and Anaplasma marginale . The economic burdens caused by this parasite are enormous, impacting at levels from family farmers up to large cattle production operations ( de Castro, 1998 ). Annual losses attributed to this tick have been estimated to be over USD 2 billion and AUD 100 million for Brazil and Australia, respectively ( Angus, 1996; Grisi et al., 2002 ). The United States eradicated the cattle tick in the 20th century and the annual savings attributable to this eradication project have been estimated at USD 3 billion in 2015 dollar value ( Graham and Hourrigan, 1977 ). Global climate change has exacerbated the threat of the cattle tick reinfesting the United States and expansion of its range in other regions of the world. New countermeasures are needed to protect and enhance the productivity of livestock affected by the cattle tick and the diseases it transmits. The primary method of control implemented against the cattle tick centers upon applications of chemical acaricide to infested herds of cattle. However, R. microplus has developed economically significant levels of resistance to all the commercially available acaricides ( Andreotti et al., 2011; Rodriguez-Vivas et al., 2014 ) and there is a great need for the development of novel effective tick control technologies. Tick vaccines are an option for cattle tick control and in some cases the tick control efficacy of vaccination exceeded 99% ( Canales et al., 2009 ). However, the only commercially available tick vaccine suffers from variable efficacy against R. microplus and the search for new vaccines is ongoing. This need for novel tick control technology drove the initiation of a cattle tick genome sequencing project in 2005, beginning with acquisition of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) using Sanger protocols ( Guerrero et al., 2005 ) and determination of genome size by a reassociation kinetics-based approach ( Ullmann et al., 2005 ). The estimated genome size of 7.1 Gbp and the highly repetitive nature of the cattle tick R. microplus genome precluded full genome sequencing until the commercial maturation of second (e.g. Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and third generation (e.g. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), USA) sequencing technologies. In the meantime, the cattle tick R. microplus genome sequencing project focused upon elucidating sequences from the transcriptome ( Wang et al., 2007; Lew-Tabor et al., 2010 ) and unique low copy fraction of the genome ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). This incipient genome project enabled several reverse vaccinology approaches aimed at identification of target antigens in the cattle tick for tick vaccine development ( Guerrero et al., 2012; Maritz-Olivier et al., 2012 ). Ticks are believed to be among the earliest terrestrial arachnids, perhaps the first to develop blood-feeding capabilities ( Mans and Neitz, 2004 ). The Prostriata lineage of hard ticks is composed of a single genus, Ixodes , containing 243 species. Assembled tick genome sequences are currently available only for the Prostriate ticks, Ixodes scapularis ( Gulia-Nuss et al., 2016 ; https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/ixodes-scapularis ) and Ixodes ricinus ( Cramaro et al., 2015 ). Ixodes scapularis was sequenced using a Sanger whole genome shotgun approach and the I. ricinus genome was sequenced using Illumina 100 nucleotide (nt) paired-end reads. Both of these assemblies contain high numbers of scaffolds that could likely be further assembled with the aid of long reads. The Metastriata line of hard ticks consists of 13 genera and over 459 species, including many species of medical and veterinary importance across the genera Rhipicephalus , Hyalomma , Hemaphysalis, Amblyomma , and Dermacentor ( Guglielmone et al., 2010 ). The evolutionary distance between I. scapularis and the Metastriate ticks results in significant sequence divergence between orthologous genes, impeding molecular studies of the Metastriates. The persisting scientific and applied agricultural need for a Metastriate genome assembly drove the design and implementation of a hybrid genome sequencing/assembly approach for the R. microplus project. Initially, we acquired an Illumina- and 454-based blended draft-level genome assembly. This assembly composed primarily of contigs derived from the low-Cot unique DNA fraction was curated and published as part of the resources provided by the CattleTickBase ( Bellgard et al., 2012 ). However, the commercial introduction of the PacBio platform, offering single molecule real-time sequencing with long reads ( Eid et al., 2009 ), facilitated movement of the cattle tick R. microplus genome sequencing to the final phase tackling the complex repetitive regions of the genome. Our study reports the assembly and annotation of the 7.1 Gbp R. microplus genome. We generated long reads of very high molecular weight genomic DNA by PacBio protocols. A subset of these reads was error-corrected by an assembled set of Illumina-generated contigs sourced from genomic DNA purified by reassociation kinetics protocols to select for the unique low-copy genome fraction. Assembly programs were customized to take optimal advantage of Cloud-based computational resources, as the huge scope of the error-correction process exceeded the available super-computer resources in Australia. The genome was searched for microRNAs (miRNA) and the expansion of the numbers of known candidate miRNAs was significant. The transcriptome of R. microplus was mapped to the genome assembly and functional annotation identified metabolic pathway members and gene ontologies (GO). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Source of tick materials Genomic DNA was extracted from pooled collections of eggs from the f7, f10, f11, and f12 generation of the R. microplus Deutsch strain. The Deutsch strain was started from a few individual engorged females collected from a 2001 tick outbreak in Webb County, TX, USA. Although the strain has been inbred since its collection and creation in 2001, it is not genetically homogeneous. A total of 10 g of eggs was used in a protocol from Sambrook et al. (1989) to purify very high molecular weight genomic DNA ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). The protocol consisted of pulverizing frozen material in a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle, addition to an aqueous buffer, followed by RNAse treatment, digestion by proteinase K, phenol extraction, and dialysis in 50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The resultant DNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis to be >200 kb. An aliquot of this genomic DNA was processed by Cot filtration to enrich for single, low copy, and moderately repetitive genomic DNA ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). 2.2 Preparation of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library and sequencing of random BAC clones A genomic BAC library of R. microplus was constructed as previously described ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ) and 18,432 BAC clones were randomly selected and sequenced using Illumina pair-end technology (described in Section 2.4 ) by Amplicon Express Inc. (Pullman, WA, USA). The R. microplus BAC library was constructed from High Molecular Weight (HMW) genomic DNA processed at Amplicon Express, Inc. as previously described ( Tao and Zhang, 1998 ). HMW DNA was partially digested with the restriction enzyme Bam HI and size selected prior to ligation of fragments into the pECBAC1 vector and transformation of DH10B Escherichia coli host cells, which were then plated on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar with chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml), X-gal and isopropyl β- d -1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at appropriate concentrations. Clones were robotically picked with a Genetix QPIX (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) into 120 × 384-well plates containing LB freezing media. Plates were incubated for 16 h, replicated and then frozen at −80 °C. DNA from 28 random BAC clones was digested with 5 U of Not I enzyme for 3 h at 37 °C. The digestion products were separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (CHEF-DRIII system, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a 1% agarose gel in TBE. Insert sizes were compared with those of the Lambda Ladder MidRange I PFG Marker (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Electrophoresis was carried out for 18 h at 14 °C with an initial switch time of 5 s, a final switch time of 15 s, in a voltage gradient of 6 V/cm. The average BAC clone insert size for the library was found to be 118 kb. 2.3 Focused Genome Sequencing (FGS) Focused Genome Sequencing (FGS) was used to sequence 18,432 randomly selected R. microplus BAC clones. FGS is a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) method developed at Amplicon Express that allows high quality assembly and scaffolding of BAC clone sequence data generated on the Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina, Inc.). Individual BAC clones were made into Pools and Superpools according to US Patent 8301388 (Amplicon Express, Inc., Pullman,; www.google.com/patents/US8301388 ). BAC DNA was prepared using a standard alkaline lysis procedure ( Sambrook and Russell, 2001 ). Pooled BAC DNA was resuspended in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 at a high concentration and mechanically sheared to fragment sizes of 170 bp, 400 bp, 800 bp, 2,000 bp and 4,000 bp using a GeneMachines Hydroshear (San Carlos, CA, USA) and SonicMan (Spokane, WA, USA) technologies to achieve the respective sizes. Illumina libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq to an average depth of 100× coverage. The gapped contiguous sequences were ordered and orientated using Mira mapping software in conjunction with ALLPATH-LG taking into account various Illumina library sizes. Illumina libraries of insert sizes 170 bp, 400 bp, 800 bp, 2,000 bp and 4,000 bp were used on each pool of BAC DNA. The sequence reads were made into contigs and scaffolds using Mira and ALLPATHS-LG. Data from the assembled pools were deconvoluted using lookup tables based on the Pool and Superpool Matrix scheme. Unique sequence reads were deconvoluted with specific Illumina tags and mapped back to specific BAC clone addresses. Repeat elements were traced to BAC clone “sets” that share common repeats and sizes of the gaps caused by repeats were determined using ALLPATHS-LG output files. The FGS process makes NGS tagged libraries of BAC clones and generates a consensus sequence of the BAC clones with all reads assembled at ∼80 bp overlap and ∼98% identity. 2.4 Library preparation and sequencing of Illumina and PacBio datasets Rhipicephalus microplus genomic DNA was sequenced at the National Center for Genomic Resources (Santa Fe, NM, USA) as described in McCooke et al. (2015) . Briefly, the Illumina-based sequencing of the Cot-selected genomic DNA made use of the standard Illumina DNA library preparation protocol and the TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation V2 kit (Illumina Inc.). This library was sequenced as 100 nt-paired ends on three lanes in a flowcell using the HiSeq2000. The resulting raw reads were quality processed by the Illumina pipeline and the contaminant-filtering pipeline developed at the National Center for Genomic Resources. The PacBio sequencing was performed on five libraries prepared according to the Pacific Biosciences low-input 10 kb library preparation and sequencing protocol. C2 chemistry and XL polymerase were used with 178 SMRT cells. 2.5 PacBio error correction Raw SMRT PacBio reads were error corrected as described by Au et al. (2012) using the Illumina reads generated from the Cot-selected genomic DNA. Large single copy (LSC) scripts for PacBio error correction were modified to reduce the size of intermediate files, which is a significant bottleneck when using large input datasets. The PacBio error correction was found to be very computationally intensive. Initially, we utilized the EPIC supercomputer resource at Murdoch University, Australia, which is an 87.2 TeraFLOPS system comprised of 9600 processors and 500 Tb of storage. However, small-scale error correction jobs allowed us to project that the entire error correction process would require over 4 months with the entire computer resource dedicated to this project and would be cost-prohibitive. Subsequently, it became obvious that cloud resources were required and a prioritizing of the PacBio sequences for error correction was also necessary. We benchmarked and designed a massive parallel approach to error correct up to 2,000 PacBio reads per job via an Amazon cloud computing service. Owing to the computational demand for the error correction process, only PacBio reads ≥5,000 nt were error corrected as this subset of the longest PacBio reads would provide the most valuable information to close gaps and expand the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly. Of note is that error correction of PacBio reads using LSC is limited by the alignment of short Illumina reads. PacBio reads with no aligned Illumina reads are not error corrected, while those with limited Illumina read coverage, the error correction takes place only between the foremost 5′-end to the foremost 3′-end mapped reads on the PacBio sequence. Either 5′-end and/or 3′-end terminal regions of a PacBio read without mapped Illumina reads will be trimmed during the error correction process ( Au et al., 2012 ). 2.6 De novo genome assembly The assembly strategy is depicted in Fig. 1 . We drew from four sources of genome sequence data: (i) the existing assembled contigs of 454-sequenced Cot-selected genomic DNA contained in Rmi v1.0 ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ), (ii) HiSeq reads from the Cot-selected DNA, (iii) reads from the Illumina-based shotgun sequencing of the 18,432 randomly selected BACs, and (iv) PacBio reads of unselected genomic DNA ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The Cot-selected Illumina raw reads were quality trimmed using ConDeTri version 2.2 ( Smeds and Kunstner, 2011 ), then de novo assembled using SOAPdenovo2 version 2.04-r240 ( Luo et al., 2012 ) and Ray version 2.3.1 ( Boisvert et al., 2010 ). Redundancy of contigs from the data derived from the BACs, Cot-selected genomic DNA, and Rmi v1.0 was removed using CD-HIT ( Fu et al., 2012 ) and/or BLAT ( Kent, 2002 ) sequence clustering and comparisons, respectively ( Fig. 1 ). Resulting Illumina scaffolds were aligned to individual error-corrected PacBio reads using BLASTN. Error-corrected PacBio reads with alignment ≥200 bp and identity ≥90% to scaffolds were used to join Illumina scaffolds using PBJelly2 (PBSuite_15.8.24; English et al., 2012 ). Finally, error-corrected PacBio reads were de novo assembled using CANU ( Berlin et al., 2015 ), a new PacBio assembler based on the Celera assembler ( Myers et al., 2000 ). CANU utilises the MinHash Alignment Process (MHAP) for overlapping noisy, long reads using probabilistic, locality-sensitive hashing. In assembling the cleaned reads, a high MHAP sensitivity and low minimum coverage of 2× was set along with a high error rate of 0.12. We ran a shortened CANU pipeline, only running at the ‘assemble option’, as the reads have already been error-corrected. The process depicted in Fig. 1 produced the R. microplus assembly designated as Rmi v2.0. The R. microplus v2.0 genome assembly has been deposited at GenBank/DDBJ/ENA under the accession LYUQ00000000. The version described in this paper is version LYUQ01000000. Raw Illumina and PacBio reads were submitted to the Short Read Archive (SRA) database under the BioProject PRJNA312025. 2.7 Discovery and annotation of R. microplus repeat families Illumina scaffolds derived from sequencing of the Cot-selected DNA and the BAC clones were used as templates to compile R. microplus repeat models using RepeatModeler v1.0.4 ( http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html ). RepeatModeler uses RECON ( Bao and Eddy, 2002 ) and RepeatScout v1 ( Price et al., 2005 ) to perform de novo predictions of repeat families. The Repbase library 20150807 ( Jurka et al., 2005 ) was used for reference-based repeat element searches. Tandem repeat elements were predicted using trf ( Benson, 1999 ). RepeatMasker version 3.2.9 ( http://www.repeatmasker.org/ ) was then used to mask these predicted repeat elements in the Rmi v2.0 assembly (described in Section 2.6 ) using the predicted R. microplus custom repeat model. Additionally, contigs and scaffolds from the BAC, 454 (Rmi v1.0), Cot-selected Illumina and PacBio-derived datasets were masked as separate datasets to compare the repeat content detected by the different technologies and/or enrichment approaches. 2.8 Gene prediction and genome annotation Gene predictions were performed using two approaches: (i) ab initio prediction using MAKER version 2.31.8 ( Cantarel et al., 2008 ), SNAP version 2006-07-28 ( Korf, 2004 ) and Augustus version 3.01 ( Stanke et al., 2006 ), and (ii) mapping non-redundant R. microplus transcripts onto the Rmi v2.0 assembly using BLAT ( Kent, 2002 ) ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Public and unpublished R. microplus transcriptome datasets were clustered using Cd-hit ( Li and Godzik, 2006 ) with a minimal 95% sequence identity as previously reported ( Ma et al., 2014 ) yielding a 63,416 non-redundant R. microplus transcript dataset ( Supplementary Table S2 ). These non-redundant sequences were then parsed using RepeatMasker v4.0.5 ( http://www.repeatmasker.org/ ) to identify repeat containing sequences. Transcripts encoding repeats were discarded, leaving 43,874 non-redundant R. microplus transcripts for ab initio predictions. These filtered transcripts were provided to MAKER ( Cantarel et al., 2008 ) as ‘EST’ evidence to generate a R. microplus ‘training set’ for ab initio programs. SNAP ( Korf, 2004 ) or AUGUSTUS ( Stanke et al., 2006 ) were then trained and their resulting predicted gene models were used as a ‘refined gene model training set’ to re-run these tools. The predicted refined gene models by both SNAP ( Korf, 2004 ) and AUGUSTUS ( Stanke et al., 2006 ) were then combined and used to re-run MAKER to identify R. microplus gene loci. MAKER identified 67,982 putative gene loci that were then filtered to < 0.5 Annotation Edit Distance (AED), yielding 8,084 gene loci supported by 8,645 gene isoforms. The gene isoform with the lowest AED value was selected as the representative sequence for each locus ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). To identify additional R. microplus gene loci that may have been missed by the ab initio pipelines, we mapped the 63,416 non-redundant R. microplus transcripts onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly using BLAT ( Kent, 2002 ) with at least 95% sequence identity and over 50% sequence coverage. A total of 30,301 non-redundant R. microplus transcripts mapped onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly and then parsed using RepeatMasker as described above ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Three filtering strategies were applied to mapped transcripts: (i) transcripts with no repeat content were re-aligned onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly using BLAT with ≥95% nt sequence identity and ≥50% sequence coverage; (ii) transcripts with ≥50% repeat content were discarded as these are not typical mRNA sequences and owing to the ambiguous mapping of their repeat regions; and (iii) mapped transcripts containing less than 50% repeats were evaluated for their protein coding potential using TransDecoder v3.0 ( Tang et al., 2015 ). Transcripts with Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of at least 100 amino acids (aa) were re-aligned onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly with ≥95% sequence identity and ≥50% sequence coverage. To increase the mapping accuracy of transcripts lacking an ORF ≥100 aa, these were re-aligned onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly with ≥99% sequence identity and ≥90% sequence coverage. The genomic sequences of mapped transcripts passing the above filtering steps were concatenated and converted to GFF format using Blat2GFF ( http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu:8081/gmod/tandy/blat2gff.pl ). Subsequently these transcripts were clustered and merged using Gffread v2.2.1 (Cufflinks suite v2.2.1). A representative sequence for each locus was then selected using the following filtering criteria: (i) largest number of exons; (ii) highest BLAT bit score; and (iii) longest alignment length ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Finally, representative sequences from both ab initio predicted gene loci and transcript-mapping evidence supported gene loci were merged using Gffread v2.2.1. A representative gene sequence for each merged and non-redundant gene locus was then selected based on the following criteria: (a) encodes the largest number of exons; (b) has the lowest AED score; and/or (c) has the highest BLAT bit score. Representative gene sequences were then rerun using Gffread to define their genomic coordinates. A fraction of the RNA-seq data used in this study was not stranded, resulting in possible isoforms mapping to both sense and antisense strands on the same genomic region. To remove duplicates encoding the same ORF we used BEDTools intersect (v2.26.0) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 ) to identify sense-antisense pairs and then their encoded ORFs were evaluated. Sense-antisense pairs encoding the same ORF were further assessed to remove ‘duplicated’ loci with a conflicting ORF orientation ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). As a final step, representative gene loci sequences were subjected to TransDecoder analysis to identify ORF ≥100 aa and classify identified protein coding genes into ‘complete’, ‘5prime partial’, ‘internal’ or ‘3prime partial’ proteins. Gene loci with an ORF shorter than 100 aa may encode non-coding RNAs or represent partial fragments of protein coding genes. 2.9 Discovery of R. microplus miRNA loci Nearly 22 million raw R. microplus small RNA reads were obtained from Barrero et al. (2011a) . Adaptor sequences were clipped using FASTX-Toolkit ( http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/ ). Unclipped reads and/or clipped reads shorter than 18 nts were excluded from downstream analyses. Redundant reads were then collapsed using mapper.pl ( Friedlander et al., 2008 ). Error-corrected PacBio reads and PacBio scaffolds were excluded from this analysis due to their anticipated ∼5% to 10% sequencing error rate. Non-redundant small RNAs were mapped onto the Rmi v2.0 assembly using Bowtie with zero mismatches ( Langmead et al., 2009 ). Candidate R. microplus miRNA loci were predicted using miRDeep as previously described ( Friedlander et al., 2008 ). Predicted miRNA loci were retained if the locus: (i) has an overall miRDeep score greater than 4.0, (ii) does not contain Ns (ambiguous base calls) overlapping the loop region of the miRNA hairpin, and (iii) candidate precursors have no sequence similarity to the R. microplus mitochondrial genome ( McCooke et al., 2015 ), R. microplus protein-coding genes, or repeat elements. 2.10 Functional annotation of protein-coding and RNA genes Representative sequences for 38,827 R. microplus gene loci were annotated using AutoFACT ( Koski et al., 2005 ). Top 10 hits were utilised to assign functional information derived from searches against the nr, uniref100, cog, pfam, smart databases, large subunit (LSU) and short subunit (SSU) ribosomal sequences ( Koski et al., 2005 ). The AutoFACT pipeline was used to assign a ‘gene description’ to representative R. microplus gene sequences along with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway information, cluster of orthologous genes (COG) function and/or gene ontology (GO). To identify protein-coding genes, representative gene sequences for each R. microplus locus were subjected to TransDecoder v3.0 ( Tang et al., 2015 ). Representative gene sequences encoding an ORF ≥100 aa were annotated as protein coding genes. The completeness of the identified protein coding genes was further assessed using TransDecoder and classified into ‘complete’, ‘5prime partial’, ‘3prime partial’ or ‘internal’ ( Tang et al., 2015 ). RNA genes were identified using two approaches: (i) AutoFACT top hit to LSU or SSU ribosomal sequences, and (ii) by screening representative gene loci sequences lacking an ORF ≥100 aa against RFAM database ( Griffiths-Jones et al., 2003 ) using BLASTN ( Altschul et al., 1990 ). Post-translational modifications were predicted using NetNGlyc v1.0 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/ ) and NetPhos v3.1 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/ ) that identify putative N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, respectively. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) coding genes were identified based on sequence similarity screening of R. microplus protein coding genes against three databases, namely, Cytochrome P450 Engineering Database (Cyped) V6.0 ( Fischer et al., 2007 ), Arthropod P450 sequences fetched from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), USA, gene database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=P450+and+arthopoda ), and AutoFACT reference databases. P450 annotation was assigned based on the best match (highest bit score) against the three above databases sources. Positive CYP matches from across AutoFACT, Cyped and NCBI Arthropoda databases with the best match, were broken down into family, subfamily and member, according to the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee ( http://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/CYP ). Assignment of Cyp identifiers required >40% identity for family, >55% identity for sub-family, and >90% for member when identified within Arthropoda, all with a coverage threshold of ≥50%, as similarly done in Parvez et al. (2016) . Regardless of whether the family, subfamily and/or member were identified, the assigned CYP identifiers were prefixed with ‘putative’ if the match was <80% identity. All identified CYPs that were ‘complete’ coding ORFs according to TransDecoder ( Tang et al., 2015 ) were then assessed through phylogenetic analysis to validate their assigned CYP. This was performed using MrBayes as previously described ( Baldwin et al., 2009 ), using 11,265,000 generations to achieve a topological convergence of <0.01, with CYP sequences from four different species: R. microplus (Rmi), Daphnia pulex (Dpu), Apis mellifera (Ame) and Drosophila melanogaster (Dme). FigTree v1.4.3 was used to depict the final phylogenetic tree using a midpoint rooting. To ascertain differences between the other CYP3s and the CYP41 sequences identified in the phylogenetic analysis, alignments of CYP3A and CYP41 sequences were performed using MUSCLE ( Edgar, 2004 ). To identify pocket regions, binding sites and catalytic sites, the sequences used in the multiple sequence alignment were then converted to PDB format using Swiss-Model ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ ) prior to further analysis. Catalytic sites were identified using Catalytic Site Identification ( http://catsid.llnl.gov/ ), pocket regions were identified using CastP ( http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/ ), and binding sites within the pocket regions were identified using MetaPocket 2.0 ( http://projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/metapocket/ ). 2.11 Evolutionary analyses To compare the evolutionary relationship of esterases or other protein families a BLASTP ( E -value ≤1e−10) screening against the NCBI non-redundant database ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) was conducted and top hits were selected. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method ( Saitou and Nei, 1987 ). The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) was calculated as previously described ( Felsenstein, 1985 ). The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method ( Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965 ) and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 ( Kumar et al., 2016 ). 2.12 Assembly and gene prediction assessment The completeness of the R. microplus Rmi v2.0 genome assembly was evaluated using BUSCO ( Simao et al., 2015 ). Predicted genes were assessed for completeness using both TransDecoder ( Tang et al., 2015 ), which assessed completeness of predicted ORFs, and BUSCO (Simao et al. http://busco.ezlab.org/files/BUSCO-Simao-Waterhouse-Bioinformatics-2015.pdf ) which assessed the predictions in context with known ancestral Arthropoda proteins. Once protein-coding ORFs were predicted by TransDecoder ( Tang et al., 2015 ), those were further processed by BUSCO for gene assessment, which uses hmmer3 to assess orthologous groups with single-copy orthologs from ancestral arthropoda proteins. The results are then interpreted as complete single-copy genes, complete duplicate copy genes, fragmented genes, and missing genes (ancestral proteins not accounted for). 2.13 Comparative analyses To evaluate the conservation of identified R. microplus protein-coding genes in the Rmi v2.0 assembly, reference protein datasets for the following 11 species were selected: Anopheles gambiae (GCF_000005575.2_AgamP3_protein.faa), A. mellifera (GCF_000002195.4_Amel_4.5_protein.faa), Bos taurus (GCF_000003055.6_Bos_taurus_UMD_3.1.1_protein.faa), Caenorhabditis elegans (GCF_000002985.6_WBcel235_protein.faa), D. melanogaster (GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_protein.faa), D. pulex (GCA_000187875.1_V1.0_protein.faa), Danio rerio (GCF_000002035.5_GRCz10_protein.faa), Gallus gallus (GCF_000002315.3_Gallus_gallus-4.0_protein.faa), Homo sapiens (GCF_000001405.31_GRCh38.p5_protein.faa), I. scapularis (GCF_000208615.1_JCVI_ISG_i3_1.0_protein.faa), and Tribolium castaneum (GCF_000002335.2_Tcas_3.0_protein.faa). Protein coding genes from all the species were then clustered using OrthoMCL as previously described ( Li et al., 2003; Barrero et al., 2011b ) to identify protein clusters common to all species (‘core proteins’) and those unique to subsets of species and/or unique to a single species lineage. 2.14 Data accessibility Supplementary Tables S5, S7–S12 are available at Mendeley Data, doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Rhipicephalus microplus genome assembly The large size and the repetitive nature of the R. microplus genome imposed significant difficulties upon the assembly process as we sought to incorporate the repetitive fraction of the genome into the assembly. The first R. microplus genome assembly, Rmi v1.0 ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ), focused only upon the low-copy/unique fraction of the genome, as it utilized Cot-selected (to remove the repetitive DNA fraction) genomic DNA for sequencing upon the 454 platform. Sequencing the R. microplus genome wholly by the long read PacBio platform was cost-prohibitive within our available resources, thus we adopted a hybrid approach. Koren et al. (2012) reported the sequencing of the 1.2 Gbp parrot genome using a 3.8× PacBio coverage strategy supplemented with a 15.4 × 454-based coverage and error correction of the PacBio reads using a 54× coverage Illumina paired end read data set. We set these parameters as our goals for coverage of the R. microplus genome. To obtain sequence information over the entire genome, we utilized two approaches. First, we sequenced unselected very high molecular weight R. microplus genomic DNA with PacBio to a coverage of 4.6×. Second, we sequenced 18,432 BAC clones from a BAC library prepared from unselected R. microplus genomic DNA using an Illumina-based pooling and reassembly method (FGS). This BAC-based data set produced 0.24× coverage of the genome. To acquire the data set for error correcting the PacBio reads, we sequenced Cot-selected genomic DNA with Illumina HiSeq to a coverage of 15.84×. We wished to focus resources available for error correction upon the gene-rich regions of the genome. This drove our decision to use the HiSeq technology on genomic DNA that had been selected with the Cot technique, as it is enriched for the unique and less repetitive DNA fraction, rather than whole genome-derived DNA. Supplementary Table S1 contains the raw statistics for these sequencing datasets. Fig. 2 shows the read length distributions for the 13,909,582 PacBio reads. There are 1,446,530 reads ≥5,000 nt and these contain over 10.3 Gbp of sequence data comprising 1.46× genome coverage ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We selected the PacBio reads ≥5,000 nt for error correction using the Cot-selected genomic DNA Illumina sequence data set for this purpose. As the error correction process relies upon alignment to the Illumina short reads, PacBio reads that have no alignment to the short reads will be excluded from the error correction. Trimming also occurs during the error correction, as described below. Losses due to trimming and lack of alignment to short reads resulted in a final output from the error correction process of 1,389,498 reads encoding a total of 7,633,231,856 bases representing a genome coverage of 1.08× ( Supplementary Table S1 ). During the error correction process with LSC ( Au et al., 2012 ), 5′ and 3′ ends of PacBio reads that are not covered by Illumina reads are trimmed and the output error corrected PacBio reads have lost sequence information. In our error correction process, approximately 78% of the error corrected PacBio reads retained at least 70% of their original length ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). It is possible that a higher percentage of PacBio read length could have been preserved had the Illumina data been generated from unselected genomic DNA rather than the Cot-selected fraction. However, the unselected genomic DNA consists of ∼70% repetitive DNA and it is not clear how the LSC algorithm would handle this type of short read data. Au et al. (2012) reported on LSC in the context of isoform assembly of RNASeq data, which does not typically contain large, highly repetitive sequence regions. This would be an interesting topic for future studies. Another possible route to an assembled genome would be through obtaining a high genome coverage solely from PacBio sequencing. PacBio errors are reported to be randomly distributed ( Eid et al., 2009 ) and sufficient coverage should allow PacBio read redundancy to “self-correct” and produce a highly accurate assembled genome. At the time we acquired our sequence data sets, the yield of PacBio SMRT II technology was not sufficient to allow this approach to be cost-effective. Following error correction, the 1,389,498 error corrected PacBio reads were screened with the merged scaffolds dataset ( Fig. 1 ) using BLASTN, generating a set of 1,254,669 reads with a total of 7,609,790,717 nt (1.07× coverage) that had significant sequence similarity to the merged scaffolds. The Rmi v1.0 scaffolds, Illumina scaffolds, and these PacBio reads were assembled with the merged scaffold dataset using PBJelly2 ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Subsequent to the PBJelly2 assembly, there were 448,651 error corrected PacBio reads that did not assemble. Those remaining 448,651 error corrected PacBio reads were assembled with CANU ( Berlin et al., 2015 ). The resulting CANU scaffolds and singletons were combined with the PBJelly2 scaffolds to create the resulting R. microplus assembly, designated Rmi v2.0. This genome assembly is composed of 280,135 contigs in 195,170 scaffolds (N50 = 60,284 bp) representing 2.0 Gbp, including 3.01% of Ns (61.9 Mbp) incorporated into the assembled scaffolds ( Table 1 ). This assembly is a substantial improvement over the first R. microplus genome assembly encoding a total of 144.6 Mbp with an N50 of 825 bp ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). In our present study, we aimed at preferentially enriching and sequencing gene-rich regions of the R. microplus genome. The remaining ∼5Gbp of unassembled regions of the R. microplus genome are anticipated to consist of 60–80% fraction of repeat elements and portions of gene loci that have been partially assembled or missing in the Rmi v2.0 assembly (see Section 3.2 ). 3.2 Identification of transposable elements and other repeats Similar to I. scapularis , the R. microplus genome has been determined to consist of ∼70% repetitive DNA ( Ullmann et al., 2005 ). Table 2 shows that the overall repeat content of the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly was 51.44%. This fraction represents 14.56% of the entire R. microplus genome (see Section 3.4 ). Class I transposable elements represented the largest fraction of repeat elements accounting for 28.37% of our genome assembly, while Unclassified, simple repeats and Class II transposable elements encoded 18.16%, 2.21% and 2.12% of the Rmi v2.0 assembly, respectively. The most abundant Class I repeat elements are long interspersed nuclear repeats (LINEs) (11.64%) and long terminal repeats (LTRs) (9.74), while short interspersed nuclear repeats (SINEs) and Class II DNA elements account for 7.00% and 1.66% of our R. microplus genome assembly, respectively. Among the SINE elements, we found that the Ruka small interspersed element comprised 69% of the SINE content. The Ruka element was previously found to be specific to ixodid tick species including Rhipicephalus appendiculatus , R. microplus, Amblyomma variegatum and I. scapularis ( Sunter et al., 2008 ). The longest repetitive element in the R. microplus assembly was a 55,684 bp simple repeat sequence, (CTAT) n , which was contained in positions 3,396 to 59,680 in a 82,162 bp long genomic scaffold (RMI_v2_068324). The repeat content of subsets of datasets generated for this study are shown in Supplementary Table S4 . Our three Cot-selected datasets, derived from genomic DNA selected for the unique and low copy fractions of the genome, contain 24.6% (454 low-Cot data; Rmi v1.0), 28.4% (Illumina low-Cot; Ray assembly) and 32.2% (Illumina low-Cot; SOAPdenovo assembly), while our two whole genome shotgun datasets, the BAC and PacBio CANU assembled datasets, contain 59.75% and 60.0% repeat elements, respectively ( Supplementary Table S4 ). Our findings that the genome, as reflected by the BAC and PacBio datasets, contained 54% to 60% repeat element content is generally consistent with the re-association kinetics-based result of ∼70% repetitive DNA in the R. microplus genome. There is the possibility that repeat-rich regions may comprise a larger fraction of the R. microplus genome than our data indicates, as these elements may have been collapsed into fewer highly similar repeat elements during the assembly process. Additionally, our PacBio dataset used to produce Rmi v2.0 is biased toward the less repetitive fraction of the genome, since our error correction Illumina data was derived from Cot-selected DNA. Thus, our estimate of 54–60% repeat element content for the R. microplus genome is likely a conservative figure ( Table 2 ). Gulia-Nuss et al. (2016) reported that 16.7% of the I. scapularis genome consisted of transposable elements, including Non-LTR retrotransposons, DNA transposons, and LTR retrotransposons that comprised 6.7%, 3.06%, and 0.64% of that tick's genome, respectively. Comparing the repeats found in the R. microplus genome with those reported in the I. scapularis genome, we found there is a larger fraction of the R. microplus genome as LTR retrotransposons (2.76%), and a lower fraction of DNA transposons (0.47%). The LTR retrotransposon Gypsy has over 233,000 copies in the R. microplus Rmi v2.0 assembly while the I. scapularis genome contains approximately 29,000 copies. As Gypsy is known to be infectious in invertebrates ( Kim et al., 1994 ), the role of the retrotransposon in R. microplus genome evolution would be an interesting topic for further study. Nystedt et al. (2013) reported the Norway spruce genome size estimate of 19.6 Gbp, with 58% of the genome consisting of LTR retrotransposons and 35% of this consisting of Gypsy repeat elements. The large genome size of the Norway spruce and other conifers was proposed to be due to expansions of LTR elements such as Gypsy combined with conifers' inefficient mechanisms to inactivate and remove transposable elements from their genomes. 3.3 Identification of R. microplus gene loci We identified 38,827 putative gene loci in the Rmi v2.0 assembly derived from both mapping non-redundant R. microplus transcripts onto the genome assembly and ab initio gene prediction using MAKER ( Cantarel et al., 2008 ), SNAP ( Korf, 2004 ) and AUGUSTUS ( Stanke et al., 2006 ) ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). We identified 24,758 protein coding gene loci (≥100aa), of these 9,265 (37.42%), 8,867 (35.81%), 2,301 (9.29%) and 4,325 (17.47%) were classified by TransDecoder ( Tang et al., 2015 ) as ‘complete’, ‘5 prime partial’, ‘3 prime partial’ and ‘internal’, respectively ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Overall we found 17,297 (44.55%) and 21,530 (55.45%) gene loci encoded by a single-exon or multiple exons, respectively ( Supplementary Table S6 ). Gene loci classified as ‘complete’ showed the least proportion of single-exon loci (24.73%), while more than half (54.38%) of the gene loci classified as ‘internal’ were single-exon ( Supplementary Table S6 ). The average length of exons was similar for gene loci classified as ‘complete’, ‘5 prime’, ‘internal’ and ‘3 prime’ ranging from 277.6 bp to 410 bp indicating a consistent exon structure across all gene loci ( Supplementary Table S6 and Fig. S3 ). Nucleotide sequences for identified R. microplus gene loci were annotated using AutoFACT annotation pipeline ( Koski et al., 2005 ) and by BLASTN comparison to the RFAM database. Table 3 summarises the classification of 38,827 R. microplus gene loci into sequences with similarity to ‘known genes’ (47.84%), ‘domain-containing proteins’ (3.04%), ‘conserved hypothetical genes’ (4.90%) with hits to sequences in public databases with an unknown function, and ‘hypothetical genes’ (44.22%) encompassing sequences only found in the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). 3.4 Evaluation of completeness of R. microplus genome To estimate genome completeness, we examined the 38,827 putative Rmi v2.0 gene loci described above for highly conserved single-copy protein coding genes that are found in nearly all arthropods using BUSCO analysis software ( Simao et al., 2015 ). BUSCO indicated 40.1% genome completeness based on 2,675 ancestral proteins used in the analysis ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Among the identified ancestral arthropod genes found by BUSCO there were 794 (29.7%) and 278 (10.4%) R. microplus gene loci classified as complete and fragments, respectively ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). These findings generally correlate with the current length of the Rmi v2.0 assembly (2.0 Gbp) that represents ∼28% of the estimated 7.1 Gbp R. microplus genome. We refined our BUSCO analysis to attempt to find more of the missing 1,603 (59.9% of the total BUSCO genes) ancestral arthropod genes in the Rmi v2.0 assembly. It is possible that Metastriate ticks such as R. microplus possess genes with distant sequence similarity to the BUSCO ancestral set. It is also possible that the selective low-Cot DNA sequencing approach may result in partial assembly of gene loci such that our BUSCO analysis missed those. Additionally, the RNA-seq datasets used in this study may not encompass the expression of all R. microplus counterparts to ancestral proteins and/or the stringency of the computational pipeline resulted in the identification of only a limited fraction of the corresponding ancestral gene loci ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). To evaluate whether any of the missing ancestral arthropod proteins could be found in our RNA-seq dataset, we subjected our 63,416 non-redundant R. microplus transcriptome dataset, described earlier and in Supplementary Table S2 , to BUSCO analysis. We identified hits to 2,274 ancestral proteins (85.01% of the total BUSCO ancestral arthropod gene dataset) with only 401 ancestral proteins (∼15% of the total BUSCO dataset) missing in our R. microplus transcriptome dataset ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). This result suggests that R. microplus counterparts to ancestral proteins are not highly divergent in sequence, but more likely the 1,603 ancestral proteins missing in our Rmi v2.0 genome assembly might be due to a lack of scaffolds encoding these ancestral proteins and/or existing scaffolds accounting for less than 50% coverage of the BUSCO gene sequences. We re-aligned 1,919 RNA-seq transcripts that had not aligned onto the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly and had hits to 1,125 of the 1,603 missing BUSCO ancestral proteins ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). We also lowered the transcript alignment coverage threshold to ≥30%, to help identify partial gene loci on the Rmi v2.0 assembly for these transcripts. We found partial mapping positions for 507 of these R. microplus transcripts onto 445 putative genomic locations on the Rmi v2.0 assembly ( Supplementary Table S7 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). These partially mapped transcripts have hits to 349 missing ancestral arthropods genes ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Thus, combining results from both BUSCO analyses, we have identified 1421 hits to BUSCO arthropods ancestral proteins (53.1% of the total BUSCO dataset) based on 24,758 protein coding gene loci identified in Rmi v2.0 and 445 from our partial mapping strategy. This finding suggests that ∼47% of the arthropods ancestral proteins are missing in the ∼2.0 Gbp Rmi v2.0 genome assembly. 3.5 Genome-wide annotation Representative sequences identified for 38,827 R. microplus gene loci ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) were annotated using AutoFACT ( Koski et al., 2005 ). Of that total 18,575 (47.84%), 1,181 (3.04%) and 1,901 (4.90%) gene loci had significant sequence similarity to known genes, domain-containing proteins, and conserved hypothetical proteins, respectively ( Table 3 and Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). We also identified 17,170 (44.22%) hypothetical gene loci with no sequence similarity to available gene sequences from any species ( Supplemental Table S5 ; Table 3 ). Functional annotation of representative R. microplus sequences identified 1,153 gene loci associated with 136 KEGG pathways ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Comparing the KEGG pathways found in R. microplus to those in I. scapularis , 970 of these gene loci assigned to 91 KEGG pathways are shared with I. scapularis ( Supplemental Fig. S5A ), while 45 and 14 KEGG pathways were unique to R. microplus or I. scapularis , respectively. Among the top overrepresented KEGG pathways in R. microplus we found a 12-fold, 11-fold and eightfold increase in genes assigned to the ‘Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction’, TGF-beta signalling pathway and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, while I. scapularis showed 1.6-fold increase in genes assigned to the Notch signalling pathway ( Supplementary Fig. S5B ). Comparison of genes involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor identified two and a single putative ‘Partitioning-defective 3-like beta’ ( PAR3B ) gene in the Rmi v2.0 (Rmi_v2_LOC_023216.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_023217.1) and IscaW1 (XP_002404429.1) genome assemblies, respectively. We also found two putative PAR3 isoform X11 genes in R. microplus (Rmi_v2_LOC_023009.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_023010.1) encoded in the same genomic region as sense-antisense transcripts. Owing to the lack of strand information in the RNA-seq datasets used in the gene loci prediction approaches, caution needs to be exercised when evaluating sense-antisense genes with non-identical ORFs. Assessment of annotated putative R. microplus PAR3B and PAR3X11 genes for both gene locus and their encoded ORF orientation shows that there is likely a single PAR3B (Rmi_v2_LOC_023217.1) and PARX11 (Rmi_v2_LOC_023010.1) gene in Rmi v2.0 genome assembly. The I. scapularis IscaW1 genome assembly was not reported to encode a PAR3X11 gene. The diverse PAR3 gene family has been shown to play a role in asymmetrical cell division and direct polarized cell growth from nematodes to vertebrates ( Kohjima et al., 2002 ). Another key difference found is the lack of a putative ‘Glutamate receptor’ in I. scapularis , while in the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly we identified four putative metabotropic glutamate receptors (Rmi_v2_LOC_007400.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_019725.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_019727.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_034524.1) with most of them being classified as ‘Complete’ proteins by TransDecoder. Glutamate receptors are synaptic receptors located primarily on the membranes of neuronal cells including the larval neuromuscular junction ( Thomas and Sigrist, 2012 ). The use of glutamate receptor inhibitors against insect skeletal muscle glutamate receptors has been suggested as a potential insecticide. It remains to be elucidated whether one or more of the putative R. microplus glutamate receptors identified in this study is uniquely expressed in skeletal muscle, providing new opportunities for the controlling R. microplus populations. The AutoFACT program assigned cluster of orthologous genes (COG) annotation to 4,143 transcripts that mapped onto the Rmi v2.0 assembly ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Comparison of R. microplus COG annotation against that of I. scapularis identified a 13.7 and 4.3-fold increase in ‘Replication, recombination and repair’ and ‘Chromatin structure and dynamics’, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S5C ). Among the gene loci with COG annotation of ‘Replication, recombination and repair function’, we found 305, 147 and 132 genes annotated as ‘gag-pol fusion proteins’, ‘putative reverse transcriptase’ and ‘rve-domain containing protein’, respectively. Inspection of gag-pol fusion protein gene loci show that most of them represent partial sequences, while only 33 gag-pol fusion proteins were classified as ‘complete’ by TransDecoder ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). BLASTP comparison of the complete gap-pol fusion proteins against a reference Rhizophagus irregularis gag-pol fusion protein (EXX59955.1) revealed that 25 putative R. microplus gag-pol proteins had varying degrees of similarity to the reference EXX59955.1 gag-pol protein, highlighting that these were divergent and likely to represent independent genome-insertion events of tick viral sequences ( Supplementary Table S8 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). The abundant repertoire of viral-like sequences in R. microplus may facilitate its innate antiviral response via the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery that is common to insects and plants ( Gammon and Mello, 2015; Barrero et al., 2017 ). Supplementary Fig. S6 shows a substantial increase in R. microplus gene loci with Gene Ontology (GO) annotation in Rmi v2.0 compared with the Rmi v1.0 release ( Guerrero et al., 2010 ). Rmi v1.0 had 338 genes with GO annotation while Rmi v2.0 contains 9,169 genes with GO annotation, showing a significant increase in nearly all annotated cellular component, molecular function and biological process GO categories ( Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S9 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Supplementary Fig. S6 depicts a comparison of R. microplus GO genome-wide annotations against that of I. scapularis which contains GO codes assigned to 6,142 protein coding genes. Notably we found a 5.47, 5.0, 4.13 and 3.96-fold increase in ‘protein-DNA complex’, ‘DNA packing’, ‘chromatin binding’ and ‘nucleic acid binding’ GO codes in R. microplus Rmi v2.0 compared with I. scapularis IscaW1 ( Supplementary Tables S9, S10 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). One of the key families of proteins accounting for the observed differences between R. microplus and I. scapulari s is histone proteins ( Supplementary Table S10 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). We identified 58 histone proteins in R. microplus including 45 predicted to encode a complete ORF by TransDecoder ( Tang et al., 2015 ) ( Supplementary Table S10 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Among the complete histone proteins we found eight, eight and 29 annotated as H2A, H3 and H4, respectively, while in I. scapularis were identified one, four, three and three proteins annotated as H1, H2A, H2B and H3, respectively ( Supplementary Table S10 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Evolutionary relationship analysis of H2 and H3 proteins commonly found in the two tick species, showed that R. microplus encodes three clusters of histone H2 proteins, one (Rmi_v2_LOC_036667.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_036900, Rmi_v2_LOC_023192.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_03694.1) clustering with I. scapularis H2A (XP_002403551.1) and another (Rmi_v2_LOC_001119.1) with I. scapularius H2B (XP_002436057.1 and XP_002400137.1) proteins, while the third cluster (Rmi_v2_LOC_036898.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_012238.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_017065.1) is more divergent ( Supplementary Fig. S6A ). Similarly, annotated histone 3 (H3) proteins also show three phylogenetic branches, where Rmi_v2_LOC_036654.1 is the more divergent H3 protein ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ). Variants of nuclear core histones H2A and H3 have been reported to have specific functions in the regulation of gene expression and genome stability ( Yukawa et al., 2014 ). Our findings in R. microplus correlates with the sequence diversity of H2A and H3 found in other species. Absence of an R. microplus histone H1, a gene family known to be highly variable across species that is involved in the establishment of pericentric heterochromatin and normal chromatic structure in D. melanogaster ( Lu et al., 2009 ), maybe due to the partial Rmi v2.0 genome assembly. Interestingly, we found a large expansion of the histone H4 family in R. microplus , which is histone family that is lost in the I. scapularis lineage ( Gulia-Nuss et al., 2016 ). Mutations in the yeast histone H4 in which all four tail lysines are replaced by glutamines cause a pronounced defect in genome integrity owing to failure to repair damaged DNA ( Bird et al., 2002 ). The significantly larger genome of R. microplus (∼7.1 Gbp) compared with I. scapularis (2.1 Gbp) may potentially explain the need for a large repertoire of histone H4 proteins. 3.6 Discovery of novel R. microplus miRNAs Previously we reported the finding of 87 R. microplus miRNA loci ( Barrero et al., 2011a ) using the genomes of I. scapularis , D. melanogaster and the Rmi v1.0 assembly derived solely from Cot-selected R. microplus genome sequences. Only 24 of the precursor sequences for the 87 predicted R. microplus miRNAs could be found in the Rmi v1.0 assembly. With the significant increase in the content of the R. microplus assembly from Rmi v1.0 (0.15 Gbp) to Rmi v2.0 (2.0 Gbp), we reanalyzed the R. microplus genome using Rmi v2.0 to identify miRNA loci, using small RNA libraries derived from R. australis (formerly known as R. microplus ) life stages (egg, larvae, frustrated larvae exposed to the host but not allowed to feed, adult females and males) and selected adult female ticks organs (salivary glands, midgut, and ovaries). miRNAs are highly conserved throughout evolution facilitating the use of genomes from related species and/or small RNA datasets to discover miRNA loci in a species of interest ( Barrero et al., 2011a ). We found 191 non-redundant R. microplus miRNAs in the Rmi v2.0 assembly ( Supplementary Table S11 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Of these, 169 (88.5%) and 22 (11.5%) miRNAs have sequence similarity to known miRNAs ( Barrero et al., 2011a ) or represent novel tick microRNA loci, respectively. Previously we identified 24 R. microplus miRNA precursors in the Rmi v1.0 genome assembly ( Barrero et al., 2011a ). Additionally, the mature sequences for other 63 miRNAs were found by using the D. melanogaster and I. scapularis genomes ( Barrero et al., 2011a ). Thus, the finding of 191 miRNA loci in the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly represents a substantial improvement. Evaluation of the expression profiles of these microRNAs discovered that 143 and 93 were expressed in our life stage and adult tick samples, respectively ( Fig. 3 ). The majority of the identified microRNAs show specific expression restricted to either one specific life stage ( Fig. 3 A), sex or adult female organ ( Fig. 3 B). This contrasts with our previous report ( Barrero et al., 2011a ), where most of the identified R. microplus miRNAs were found expressed in multiple life stages and/or organs. In that previous study, owing to the small and incomplete nature of the Rmi v1.0 R. microplus genome assembly, we relied upon the I. scapularis (IscaW1.0) and D. melanogaster genomes for miRNA prediction in R. microplus . We had also imposed the requirement to only report miRNAs that were expressed in at least two independent small RNA libraries. Thus, our previous findings were likely biased towards evolutionarily conserved miRNAs. The identification of life stage-specific and/or organ-specific cattle tick miRNAs provides new opportunities for investigating the role of miRNAs in tick gene expression and development. 3.7 Conservation of cattle tick protein-coding genes To evaluate the conservation of R. microplus protein-coding genes (ORF ≥100 amino acids in length) compared with their counterparts in I. scapularis , insects, crustacean and vertebrates species, the proteomes of 12 species were selected including I. scapularis , Anopheles gambiae , A. mellifera , B. taurus , C. elegans , Drosophila melanogaster , T. castaneum , Drosophila pulex , D. rerio , Gallus gallus and H. sapiens . The various proteome sizes are listed in Table 4 . Comparison of shared protein families was conducted using OrthoMCL ( Li et al., 2003 ). This analysis clustered 415,232 protein-coding genes into 36,405 protein families ( Table 5 ). We found a core set of 1,254 protein families shared amongst all species included in our analysis ( Table 5 ). The core set of protein families contains 47,031 proteins. Within this core protein set, there were 2,405 and 1,604 R. microplus and I. scapularis proteins representing 9.43% and 7.84% of their proteome content, respectively ( Table 4 ). Interestingly, the species with the largest proportion of its proteome as part of the core set was A. mellifera with 15.70% of its protein sequences. Our results suggest that 8% - 9% of tick genes are conserved since the Nephrozoan (640 million years ago) ancestor ( Barrero et al., 2011a ). In the OrthoMCL analysis we identified 1697, 647 and 810 protein families unique to R. microplus , I. scapularis or to both tick species ( Table 5 ; Supplementary Table S12 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). The unique protein families found in R. microplus comprised 10,835 proteins representing 43.76% of its proteome of 24,758 proteins. In contrast, we identified 2014 unique I. scapularis proteins accounting for 9.84% of its proteome set ( Supplementary Table S12 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). These subsets of tick specific genes will facilitate functional genomic analyses aiming to understand the unique biology of ticks. 3.8 Diverse genomic loci of R. microplus esterases Increased esterase activity in arthropods is considered an important biochemical marker of pesticide resistance. In the R. microplus , esterases were found associated with resistance to both organophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid pesticides ( Rosario-Cruz et al., 2009 ). Temeyer and colleagues reported the limited aa sequence similarities among the three characterized acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) from R. microplus ( Temeyer et al., 2004 ). More recently, 27 esterase-like transcripts were found in R. microplus transcriptome datasets ( Bendele et al., 2015 ). We found 31 R. microplus gene loci with similarity to AChE as indicated by the AutoFACT description ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ); of these 13 gene loci were assessed by TransDecoder as encoding complete proteins ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). AChEs are large proteins encoding an average ∼600 aa; the shortest annotated AChE in I. scapularis encodes 464 aa (XP_002409706.1). Of the 13 R. microplus gene loci predicted to encode ‘complete’ AChEs, only eight have an ORF larger than 500 aa, while the remaining five gene loci encoded AChEs with an ORF shorter than 370 aa. These findings highlight the need to take with caution the ORF classification assigned using TransDecoder. To provide insights into the exon–intron structures and functional domains of R. microplus AChEs four divergent gene loci (Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1) were selected and evaluated. Our results show significant gene structure diversity in terms of location of the ORF and size of both exon and introns ( Fig. 4 ). Despite such gene structure divergence, these esterases are predicted to have similar protein secondary and tertiary structures ( Supplementary Fig. S8 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). We also evaluated the conservation of functional domains in these putative esterases by comparing them against published AChE protein sequences ( Baxter and Barker, 1999; Bendele et al., 2015 ). We found the active site serine (S), glutamate (E) and histidine (H) that form the AChE catalytic triad are conserved in Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1, but not in Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1 ( Supplementary Fig. S9 ). Additionally, aas predicted to form part of the substrate-binding pocket and post-translational modification motifs showed variability among all sequences suggesting that these esterases may undergo distinct post-translational modification events. Interestingly, we found that the proteins encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000816.1 harbour a signal peptide in their N-terminal region, while no such domain was found in the ORF encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1 ( Supplementary Fig. S10 ). To gain insight into the possible function of Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1, we conducted a BLASTP screening against a manually curated Swiss-Prot human database. We identified a Butyrylcholine esterase (P06276) as its top hit with 32% sequence identity and 81% query coverage. This finding contrasts with the top match found in the Swiss-Protein database for proteins encoded by the Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 representative gene sequences. The Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 protein showed 34% protein sequence similarity and 95% query coverage to a human AChE protein (accession number P04058), while the Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 encoded-protein had 30% protein sequence similarity and 90% query coverage to a different the human AChE (GenBank accession number Q27677 ). Thus, both Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000816.1 transcripts and their corresponding gene loci appear to encode secreted R. microplus AChEs. A Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic analysis was used to estimate the evolutionary relationship of the Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 encoded esterases ( Supplementary Fig. S11 ). We found that the AChE encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1 is part of a sister branch to R. microplus AChE1 ( Bendele et al., 2015 ). Curiously, the esterase encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1 is placed as an outgroup for the AChE protein encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1 and other I. scapularis proteins annotated as acetylcholinesterases ( Supplementary Fig. S11 ). The putative AChE encoded by Rmi_v2_LOC_014526.1 showed closer similarity to an I. scapularis AChE (XP_002402742.1) protein and a cluster of R. microplus AChE3 proteins. Overall our findings highlight the significant diversity of AChE gene-structures that can be utilised to design targeted control strategies to impair tick OP resistance. 3.9 Identification of R. microplus CYP superfamily genes CYPs in animals fall into two categories, namely, those that synthetize or metabolize endogenous molecules and those that interact with exogenous chemicals from the diet or environment ( Baldwin et al., 2009 ). The latter form a critical component of detoxification systems including resistance to OP coumaphos, which is the only acaracide approved for use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Veterinary Services (VS) quarantine dipping vats and spray boxes along the Texas (USA)-Mexico border ( Guerrero et al., 2007 ). We found 56 R. microplus gene loci with similarity to CYP ( Supplementary Table S5 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Of these, 20 were classified as encoding ‘complete’ protein sequences by TransDecoder analysis ( https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/releases ). We identified two, 14 and four Cyp2, Cyp3 and Cyp4 clan protein coding genes, respectively ( Supplementary Table S13 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Interestingly, among the identified R. microplus CYP genes, we found two neighbouring gene loci (Rmi_v2_LOC_001286.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_001287.1) with top similarity to CYP41, a cyp gene reported to be associated with OP resistance ( Crampton et al., 1999; Guerrero et al., 2005 ). Despite having similar gene locus sizes, both putative R. microplus CYP41 genes show distinct exon–intron structures ( Supplementary Fig. S12 ), suggesting that they were not acquired via a tandem segmental duplication ( Gotoh, 1993 ). Phylogenetic analysis of R. microplus CYP genes together with known counterparts in Daphnia , honeybee and Drosophila, showed agreement with previous studies reporting four major CYP clans for arthropod species ( Baldwin et al., 2009 ) ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S13 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Both R. microplus CYP41 proteins clustered with CYP3 clan proteins including Rmi_v2_LOC_001284.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_006171.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_035583.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_0021156.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_007826.1, and Rmi_v2_LOC_021651.1 ( Supplementary Fig. S13 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). Multiple sequence alignment of R. microplus CYP3 proteins including CYP41 identified five basic and relatively conserved motifs that were arranged from the N-terminal to the C-terminal as follows: helix C, helix I, helix K, PERF and heme-binding motifs ( Supplementary Fig. S14 ). These motifs are consistent with domains found in Plutella xylostella cytochrome P450 proteins ( Yu et al., 2015 ). Interestingly, we found that one of the R. microplus CYP41 (Rmi_v2_LOC_001287.1) and one R. microplus CYP3A (Rmi_v2_LOC_035583.1) protein lack the PERF domain ( Supplementary Fig. S15 ). The absence of this motif may impact the overall folding structure of the CYP protein and its interaction with either endogenous and/or exogenous compounds. Binding sites and active sites of proteins and DNAs are often associated with structural pockets and cavities. We used CASTp ( http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/ ) to estimate the area and volume of predicted structural pockets in selected CY3A and CYP41 proteins. We found that proteins lacking the PERF motif (Rmi_v2_LOC_001287 and Rmi_v2_LOC_035583) and/or substrate-biding sites in the N-terminal region of the CYP protein (Rmi_v2_LOC_002156, Rmi_v2_LOC_007826 and Rmi_v2_LOC_35583) were predicted to have a large solvent accessible surface (SA mean volume = 3,249 Å 3 ± 345.3; n = 4) and molecular surface (MS mean volume = 7,751.9 Å 2 ± 107.45; n = 4) ( Supplementary Table S14 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 , and Supplementary Fig. S15 ). In contrast, Rmi_v2_LOC_001286 (CYP41) and other R. microplus CYP3A proteins harbouring a PERF motif and substrate binding sites in their N-terminal region have a substantially smaller solvent accessible surface (SA mean volume = 800 Å 3 ± 75.1; n = 6) and molecular surface (MS mean volume = 3,578.6 Å 2 ± 328.1; n = 6) ( Supplementary Table S14 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 , and Supplementary Fig. S15 ). We also found that the predicted mean solvent accessible surface for CYP41 proteins (Rmi_v2_LOC_001286, AAD5400 and AAD91667) was 49.3 Å 3 larger than that of CYP3A proteins (Rmi_v2_LOC_ 001284, Rmi_v2_LOC_006171, and Rmi_v2_LOC_021651) ( Supplementary Table S14 , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/s7jrdzfmb7.1 ). The larger predicted cavity in CYP41 proteins may be required to accommodate coumaphos (C 14 H 16 ClO 5 PS) that has an average monoisotopic mass of 362.014465 Da and an estimated volume of ∼602 Å 3 . It remains to be elucidated if the new R. microplus CYP41 (Rmi_v2_LOC_001286.1) gene found in this study with an estimated solvent accessible surface volume of 897.3 Å 3 could bind coumaphos and mediate OP resistance. In conclusion, we report the gene-enriched draft assembly of ∼2 Gbp of the cattle tick R. microplus genome that is one of the most significant pests of cattle production worldwide. The R. microplus genome assembly represents the first large-scale genomic resource for the diverse lineage of metastriate ticks. We envisage that this resource will facilitate a number of applications including understanding its unique biology, transmission of pathogens and designing novel strategies to overcome the R. microplus resistance to acaricides that pose a significant threat to diary and beef industries across the globe.

Appendix A Supplementary data Supplementary Fig. S1 Rhipicephalus microplus gene prediction and transcript mapping. Gene loci from the Rmi v2.0 assembly were identified using a combined approach: i) transcript mapping, with several filtering steps, which included repeat filtering and open reading frame (ORF) filtering, and ii) ab-initio gene prediction utilizing the MAKER annotation pipeline in combination with the gene prediction tools SNAP and AUGUSTUS, which were both trained using non-repeat containing mapped transcripts. iii) The final 39,563 predicted loci were identified through clustering and merging the transcript mapped and ab-initio predictions, followed by inference of protein-coding predictions using TransDecoder. The loci were then filtered by checking for overlapping loci using BedTools intersect, requiring a gene overlapping by at least 50% on the opposite strand. The identified duplicate loci with a TransDecoder predicted ORF on the reverse strand is then removed. nr, non-redundant; AED, Annotation Edit Distance.

Supplementary Fig. S7 The evolutionary history of Rhipicephalus microplus and Ixodes scapularis histone proteins was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987). The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 5.46977490 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches (Felsenstein, 1985). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method (Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965) and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The analysis involved 12 amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 46 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 (Kumar et al., 2016). Supplementary Fig. S8 Predicted protein-folding structure of selected Rhipicephalus microplus transcripts encoding a protein with top hit to acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The three putative full-length esterases (Rmi_v2_LOC_000817.1, Rmi_v2_LOC_024806.1 and Rmi_v2_LOC_008474.1) for which their genomic loci have been elucidated in the Rmi v2.0 genome assembly, and a previously reported AChE protein (Baxter and Barker, 1999; GenBank Accession Number CAA11702.1 ), were subjected to Swiss-Model ( http://swissmodel.expasy.org/ ) and their protein folding structure predicted using an Acetylcholinesterase (2w6c.1.A) X-ray, 2.7Å template. Supplementary Fig. S9 Clustal-Omega protein alignment of tick esterases with top hit to AChE. Rhipicephalus microplus esterases predicted to be complete protein sequences (BPA_24544, BPA_67423 and BPA_67535), AChE1 (NCBI protein accession number AJA71270 ; Bendele et al., 2015) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (accession number CAA11702 ; Baxter and Barker, 1999) were aligned using Clustal-Omega ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/ ). The predicted locations of the catalytic triad are shown in bold blue (Bendele et al., 2015).

Supplementary Fig. S10 Predicted signal peptide motif in full-length Rhipicephalus microplus esterases. Protein sequences for (A) Rmi_v2_LOC_008474, (B) Rmi_v2_LOC_024806, (C) Rmi_v2_LOC_000816 and (D) Rmi_v2_LOC_014526 were subjected to the SignalP 4.1 server ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ ). The C-score (raw cleavage site score) shows output from CS networks, which are trained to distinguish signal peptide sites from everything else. S-score (signal peptide score) is the output from SP networks, which are trained to distinguish positions within signal peptides from positions in the mature part of the proteins and from proteins without signal peptides. The Y-score (combined cleavage site score) is a combination (geometric average) of the C-score and the slope of the S-score, resulting in a better cleavage site prediction than the raw C-score alone. This is due to the fact that multiple high-peaking C-scores can be found in one sequence, where only one is the true cleavage site. The Y-score distinguishes between C-score peaks by choosing the one where the slope of the S-score is steep (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Supplementary Fig. S11 Phylogenetic relationship of selected esterases including Rhipicephalus microplus counterparts (Rmi_v2_LOC_008474, Rmi_v2_LOC_024806, Rmi_v2_LOC_000816 and Rmi_v2_LOC_014526; see Supplementary Table S5 for protein sequences) were evaluated using top BLASTP hits against the non-redundant (nr) database. ∗ Acetylcholinesterase 1 (AChE1) (Bendele et al., 2015); ∗∗ AChE sequence originally from a tick classified as Boophilus microplus , then R. microplus , but now classified as Rhipicephalus australis (Baxter and Barker, 1999).

Bold red residues represent catalytic sites identified by Catalytic Site Identification ( http://catsid.llnl.gov/ ), underlined regions represent the pocket regions, identified using CastP ( http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/ ), and grey highlights denote binding sites within the pocket regions were identified using MetaPocket 2.0 ( http://projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/metapocket/ ). Catalytic sites and binding sites, which could not be identified, can be inferred based on consensus homologous sequences in the alignment.
