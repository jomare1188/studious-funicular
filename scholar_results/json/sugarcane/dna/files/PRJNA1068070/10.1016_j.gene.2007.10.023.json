    "full_text": "The entire mitochondrial genome of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Spinghidae) was sequenced — a circular molecular 15516 bp in size. The arrangement of the protein coding genes (PCGs) was the same as that found in the ancestral insect, however Manduca possessed the derived tRNA arrangement of CR-M-I-Q which has been found in all Lepidoptera sequenced to date. Additionally, Manduca , like all lepidopteran mt genomes, has numerous large intergenic spacer regions and microsatellite-like repeat regions. Nucleotide composition is highly A+T biased, and the lepidopterans have the second most biased nucleotide composition of the insect orders after Hymenoptera. Secondary structural features of the PCGs identified in other Lepidoptera were present but highly modified by the presence of microsatellite-like repeat regions which may significantly alter their function in the post-transcriptional modification of pre-mRNAs. Secondary structure models of the ribosomal RNA genes of Manduca are presented and are similar to those proposed for other insect orders. Conserved regions were identified within non-translated spacer regions which correspond to sites for the origin and termination of replication and transcription. Comparisons of gene variability across the order suggest that the mitochondrial genes most frequently used in phylogenetic analysis of the Lepidoptera, cox1 and cox2 , are amongst the least variable genes in the genome and phylogenetic resolution could be improved by using alternative, higher variability genes such as nad2 , nad3 , nad4 and nad5 ."

          "Mitochondrial (mt) genomes of metazoan animals consist of a circular molecular, 15–20 kb in size, which encodes 37 genes including 13 protein-coding subunits from three of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes, plus the 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 22 transfer (tRNA) genes necessary to translate the protein-coding genes and non-coding control elements regulating the transcription and replication of the mt genome ( Boore, 1999; Taanman, 1999 ). To date the complete or near complete mt genomes have been sequenced from 72 insect species including 7 species from the order Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Insects are the best represented group within the invertebrates and the Lepidoptera are second only to the Diptera (flies) in terms of their mt genomic coverage (7 sp vs. 18 sp) ( Cameron et al., 2006a ). Mt genomes are available for 4 lepidopteran superfamilies: Tortricoidea ( Adoxophyes ); Pyraloidea ( Ostrinia ); Bombycoidea ( Bombyx , Antheraea ) and Papilionoidea ( Coreana ). These genomes have been studied for a variety of purposes including divergences between sibling species ( Yukuhiro et al., 2002 ), identifying gene variability between congeneric species ( Coates et al., 2005 ), to facilitate population level studies ( Kim et al., 2006 ) and to investigate relationships within the order Lepidoptera ( Lee et al., 2006 ).",
          "A major outcome of the accumulation of insect mt genome data has been the capacity to examine the utility of individual genes or regions commonly targeted for phylogenetics, phylogeography, population genetics and molecular diagnostics and to identify novel genes which could prove useful for future studies ( Nardi et al., 2003, 2005; Simon et al., 2006; Cameron and Whiting, 2007 ). As in other insect groups, mt genes have been a rich source of genetic markers in the Order Lepidoptera ( Caterino et al., 2000 ). The majority of studies have investigated the genes cox1 and cox2 , usually as a combined amplicon including either the 3′ portion of cox1 , i.e. the approx. 300 bp used in earlier studies (e.g. Brower, 1994 ), or the whole of this gene, i.e. the entire 1600 bp sequenced by later workers (e.g. Landry et al., 1999 ), plus the majority of cox2 (approx. 600 bp). A noteworthy development in the use of this region of the mt genome in lepidopteran systematics are the efforts on the DNA Barcoding initiative which have concentrated on this order ( http://www.lepbarcoding.org/ ) and by June 2007 have sequenced the 5′ half of cox1 (approx. 600 bp) for over 84,000 specimens representing 8532 lepidopteran species (e.g. Hajibabaei et al., 2006 ). Other regions of the mt genome have not been extensively used across the order however several other genes which have been used in butterfly studies ( nad5 , rns and control region) have yet to be extensively trialed in other lepidopteran superfamilies ( Pollock et al., 1998; Yagi et al., 1999; Vila and Björklund, 2004 ). Examination of entire mt genomes across the Lepidoptera will allow the testing of these well studied regions and the utilization of novel mt gene regions for molecular analysis.",
          "In the present study we sequenced the entire mt genome of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta , a member of the family Sphingidae and superfamily Bombycoidea (silkmoths and relatives) ( Kristensen and Skalski, 1999 ). This mt genome thus represents a previously unstudied family and imsproves the density of mt genome sampling within the most derived and speciose lepidopteran clade, the Macrolepidoptera. Additionally, Manduca has been extensively studied as a model organism. Since 2000, over 250 articles on Manduca have been published examining a diverse range of phenomena including its molecular biology, biomechanics, and plant–herbivore or insect–pathogen interactions. Over 3700 Manduca sequences from a diverse range of genetic systems have been deposited on GenBank. However, it is perhaps most famous to the general public as the second most commonly eaten insect on reality TV after the meal worm. Despite the significance of Manduca as a model species only limited mt gene sequence is currently available. Frohlich et al. (1996) cloned the cox1 gene cDNA of M. sexta and compared it to available cox1 sequence data from other insects. Hajibabaei et al. (2006) presented partial cox1 sequences for 15 Costa Rican Manduca species (103 specimens) including 14 specimens of M. sexta and suggest on the basis of molecular divergences that M. sexta may be a complex of at least two morphologically cryptic species. No data for any mitochondrial genes other than cox1 is available for Manduca and none for any genes other than cox1 or cox2 for any sphingid. The aims of the present study were thus to sequence the entire mt genome of M. sexta which can be used to develop molecular markers for phylogenetics, identification and species delimitation within this important model insect species and also to examine gene variability and utility across the available lepidopteran mt genomes to facilitate informed gene choice for molecular studies within this order."

Transfer RNA analysis was conducted using tRNAscan-SE ( Lowe and Eddy, 1997 ) using invertebrate mitochondrial codon predictors and a cove score cut off of 1. Reading frames between tRNAs were found in Sequencher and identified using translated BLAST searches (blastx) ( Altschul et al., 1997 ) as implemented at the NCBI website ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). Nucleotide composition was calculated using PAUP ver4b10 ( Swofford, 2002 ). tRNA comparisons across Lepidoptera were performed in Mega ver 3.1 ( Kumar et al., 2004 ) using the secondary structures predicted by tRNAscan-SE to identify homologous sites. rRNA secondary structures were inferred using alignment to the models predicted for Drosophila ( Cannone et al., 2002 : Comparative RNA Web, http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu ), Apis ( Gillespie et al., 2006 ) and zygaenoid moths ( Niehuis et al., 2006a,b ). Stem-loops are named using both the conventions of Gillespie et al. (2006) and that of Niehuis et al. (2006a,b) with the former notation first for each time they are mentioned. Alignments of the protein coding and rRNA genes for each of the available lepidopteran mt genomes were made in Mega ver3.1 using Adoxophyes as an outgroup as this is the earliest branching lepidopteran mt genome available according to the widely accepted ordinal phylogeny of Kristensen and Skalski (1999) . Nucleotide ratios, numbers of variable and informative sites and genetic distances (uncorrected p distances) were calculated in PAUP ⁎ ver 4b10."

              "The mt genome of Manduca is a circular molecule 15,516 bp in size and has been deposited in GenBank (Accession number: EU286785 ). This is comparable to the mt genome sizes reported for other lepidopterans which range from 15,314 bp in Coreana raphaelis (Lycaenidae) to 15,928 bp in Bombyx mandarina (Bombycidae) ( Yukuhiro et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2006 ). Each of the 37 genes found in a typical metazoan mt genome were present: 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and 22 transfer RNA genes. As is frequently the case with insect mt genomes, tRNA-Scan-SE failed to find a copy of tRNA-Ser ( AGN ) , which was determined by sequence comparison of the region in which this gene occurs in other insect species. The mt genome arrangement of Manduca was similar to that found in the inferred ancestral insect ( Boore, 1999 ) except for the location of tRNA-Met which is located between the control region and tRNA-Ile , giving the derived arrangement CR-M-I-Q as opposed the insect ground plan arrangement CR-I-Q-M. This arrangement, first noted by Taylor et al. (1993) in lycaenids and noctuids, has now been found in five lepidopteran superfamilies (Papilionoidea, Noctuoidea, Pyraloidea, Tortricoidea, and Bombycoidea) and is likely a shared feature of all derived moths. There also are 6 major non-coding regions including the putative control region. This is comparable to other lepidopteran species which have a higher number of non-coding regions than are typically found in other insect mt genomes. The structure of the mt genome of Manduca and the amplicons used for sequencing are given in Fig. 1 .",
              "The nucleotide composition bias of the mt genome of Manduca is 81.79% A + T, made up of 80.3% in the protein-coding genes, 85.1% in the ribosomal RNA genes and 95.4% in the control region. This is similar to the nucleotide composition biases found in other lepidopteran species which range from 82.66% for Coreana to 80.15% in Antheraea ( Table 2 ). Lepidoptera have amongst the most compositionally biased mt genomes within the insects which range from 65.6% A + T in Reticulitermes (Isoptera) to 89.3% in Apis (Hymenoptera). The nucleotide skew statistics (sensu Perna and Kocher, 1995 ) 1 1 Skew statistics measure the relative proportions of A's to T's, (A − T) / (A + T), and G's to C's (G − C) / (G + C). Positive skew indicates an excess of A's or G's whereas negative skew indicates an excess of T's and C's. The statistic scales from 0 (equal proportions of each nucleotide) to 1 (complete absence of one nucleotide). for the whole mt genome (measured on the majority strand) show that Manduca lacks significant A or T skew (− 0.00536) and has moderate C skew (0.181). This is similar to other Lepidoptera all of which have negligible A or T skew (0.0587 to − 0.0475) and moderate C-skew (0.158–0.216) and to most insect species. The only major departures from this pattern are found in insect species with significantly lower genome A + T% such as termites ( Cameron and Whiting, 2007 ) or with highly rearranged mt genomes such as lice ( Cameron et al., 2007 ). Comparing between the genes encoded on the majority strand ( cox1 , cox2 , cox3 , cob , atp6 , atp8 , nad2 , nad3 , nad6 ) and those encoded on the minority strand ( nad1 , nad4 , nad4l , nad5 ) shows that each gene set is moderately T-skewed (the balance of these opposite skews on each strand results in a lack of A/T skew in the genome as a whole), the majority gene set is moderately C-skewed and the minority set strongly G-skew (additively a strong C-skew in the entire genome) ( Table 2 ). This pattern is consistent across Lepidoptera. Considering only four-fold degenerate sites, whose nucleotide composition is evolutionarily neutral, most lepidopteran species have majority strands A/C skewed and minority stands T/G skewed. Due to asymmetrical mutation pressure on the mt genome, nucleotide composition is typically skewed in opposite directions on each strand ( Perna and Kocher, 1995; Hassasin et al., 2005 ). Antheraea and Coreana were exceptions to this pattern in which both the majority and minority strands lacked significant A or T skew. The difference between the majority mt genes as a whole, which were moderately T-skewed, and the four-fold degenerate sites, whose strong A-skew reflects asymmetrical mutation pressure favoring T-substitutions on the minority strand, suggests that active selection on nucleotide composition may be responsible for overcoming background mutation pressures (e.g. Meiklejohn et al., 2007 )."

              "A summary of the genes which make up the mt genome of Manduca are given in Table 3 . Twelve of the thirteen protein-coding genes use standard ATN start codons coding for I (4 genes) or M (8 genes). The exception is cox1 which uses CGA, coding for R, as a start codon. All lepidopteran species examined to date use R as the initial amino acid for cox1 and the use of non-canonical start codons for this gene is common across insects ( Fenn et al., 2007 ). Frohlich et al. (1996) have previously proposed that the start codon for cox1 in Manduca is the ATT (I) located 12 bp upstream of the CGA (R) start codon annotated here i.e. is 4 amino acids longer. This I is located 8 bp into the tRNA-Tyr gene which is encoded immediately upstream of cox1 . Overlap between tRNA-Tyr and cox1 would be unusual and indeed the actual cDNA clone sequenced by Frohlich et al. (1996) was approximately 30 bp shorter than the sequence which they published. The additional sequence reported was obtained by a separate PCR amplification of the flanking tRNAs. This shorter cDNA clone combined with the location of the tRNA suggests that cox1 is shorter than that proposed by Frohlich et al. (1996) and is consistent with annotation presented here.",
              "Of the nine protein-coding genes flanked by tRNAs at their 3′ end, four had incomplete stop codons consisting of just a T-nucleotide. Ojala et al. (1980; 1981) has proposed that polycistronic pre-mRNA transcripts are processed by endonucleases which recognize the secondary structures of tRNAs and that polyadenylation of adjacent protein-coding genes would produce functional stop-codons from partial stop codons such as a single T-nucleotide. Accordingly partial stop codons have been observed in most insect mt genomes including all lepidopteran species sequenced to date ( Yukuhiro et al., 2002; Coates et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006 ). There is also a high degree of conservation of incomplete stop codons across the order; cox1 and cox2 have incomplete stop codons in all lepidopteran species and nad5 has one in all species except Bombyx . Four of the protein-coding genes in Manduca are flanked by other protein-coding genes at the 3′ end: atp8 → atp6 ; atp6 → cox3 ; nad4l → nad4 ; nad6 → cob . Kim et al. (2006) and Fenn et al. (2007) have demonstrated that RNA secondary structures at each of these gene boundaries are likely targeting sites for endonuclease processing of the pre-mRNA, cutting between each gene liberates a mature mRNA. Secondary structures similar to those found in other Lepidoptera were found for the two genes which overlap their 3′ adjacent gene: atp8 has a stem-loop structure consisting of 9 paired-bases located 2 bp from the gene's 3′ end; and atp6 a 10 paired-base stem loop 3 bp from the end. In most insect mt genomes nad6 and cob overlap by a single base, the stop codon of the first gene also forming part of the start codon of the later. In Manduca , these genes are separated by 17 bp and the 3′ end of nad6 forms a stem-loop structure with only limited similarity to that found by Kim et al. (2006) : a 17 paired-base stem and 56 bp loop in Manduca vs. 7 base stem and 31 bp loop in Coreana . Additionally, nad4l , which typically overlaps nad4 in most insect mt genomes, in Manduca is separated from nad4 by an 83 bp spacer region, including a microsatellite-like zone, and no stem-loop structure was found in the 3′ end of nad4l . A similar gene structure is found in Bombyx spp. in which nad6 and cob are separated by a microsatellite containing spacer region ( Yukuhiro et al., 2002 ). Given that stem-loop structures both in tRNAs and the mRNAs of protein-coding genes appear to be important for the correct processing of mitochondrial genome transcripts ( Ojala et al., 1980, 1981 ), further investigation is needed into the effect of microsatellite-like regions located between genes on their transcription."

              "Manduca had the typical set of 22 tRNA genes, one for each of the 20 amino acids with an additional isotype for each of the two 6-fold degenerate amino acids Leucine and Serine. Sequence comparisons across Lepidoptera showed limited sequence variation within the order for the functionally constrained portions of the tRNA (stems and the anticodon loop) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Variability was largely confined to the non-paired sites within the DHU and TΨC loops, however overall sequence variation within the tRNAs of Lepidoptera was much lower than that found in Diptera, the only other insect order in which such comparisons have been made ( Cameron et al., 2007 ). Within the acceptor stem, maximally 3 of the 7 paired sites were variable across the order in tRNA-Leu ( CUN ) and tRNA-Pro but were invariant for 11 of the other 21 tRNA genes. For the DHU stem tRNA-Cys was the most variable gene, 2 of 4 sites, and 10 tRNAs isotypes were invariant at this stem. tRNA-Pro and tRNA-Tyr had the most variable TΨC stems, 3 of 5 sites, however this stem was invariant in 11 tRNAs. The anticodon stem and loop had extremely low variability being invariant across Lepidoptera for 7 tRNAs and the most variable gene, tRNA-His , had only 4 of the 12 sites variable (5 stem and 7 loop nucleotides). The only exception to the generally low variability of lepidopteran tRNAs was tRNA-Gln in Adoxophyes which possesses a 34 bp repeat of approximately half the gene, including the 3′ half of the DHU stem, the entirety of the anticodon loop and the 5′ half of the TΨC stem, which should render this gene incapable of forming a functional tRNA without post-transcriptional modification.",
              "Both small ( rns ) and large ( rnl ) ribosomal subunits broadly conformed to the secondary structure models proposed for these genes from other insects ( Gillespie et al., 2006; Niehuis et al., 2006a,b ) ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). In rns there are differences in the length of stem H1047/38 and the associated stems H1068/39, H1074/40 and H1113/42 ( Niehuis et al., 2006a ), however as demonstrated by Gillespie et al. (2006) for Apis this region of rns typically yields multiple possible secondary structures within a given species and it is not clear which structures are utilized in situ . Similarly, stem H47/8 was variable between different lepidopteran species, while the terminal portion of this stem as identified by Niehuis et al. (2006a) was present in Manduca , it is absent in other bombycoids which have a correspondingly larger loop. There are several differences between the annotation of rnl in the present study and that of Niehuis et al. (2006b) . Niehuis et al. (2006b) do not annotate either the H183 or H2735 stem-loops which are respectively the first and last stem-loops of rns under Gillespie et al.'s (2006) structure. Both stem-loops could be formed from the unfolded bases reported by Niehuis et al. (2006b) at the 5′ (64 bp) and 3′ (65 bp) ends of the molecule. For H2077/G3, Niehuis et al. (2006b) proposed a 25 paired bases stem and a 4 bp loop. In contrast, for Manduca we found it consisted of a 20 paired bases stem and 22 bp loop which is more similar to that proposed for Apis , 10 paired bases stem and 32 bp loop ( Gillespie et al., 2006 ). In other Lepidoptera the extended H2077/G3 stem proposed by Niehuis et al. (2006b) is also absent as the bases do not form complementary pairs, suggesting that this feature may be confined to zygaenidoids. Niehuis et al. (2006b) also propose a very short H2347/G13 composed of just the terminal 3 paired bases, compared to the 6 which we found in Manduca . This region is also highly variable within Lepidoptera and a consistent secondary structure for it could not be found within the available lepidopteran mt genomes. Manduca also has two large insert regions within rnl relative to other lepidopterans, 19 bp in the loop between Domains II and IV and 23 bp in the loop between stems H1648/E18 and H1764/E21. None of the other lepidopterans have significant indels within either of the rRNA genes except Adoxophyes which has a (TA) 14 microsatellite-like repeat located within stem H2347/G13 of rnl which would likely introduce a significant bulge within this stem. H2347/G13 has stem-bulges in other insect species and the precise location of these bulges within the stem varies considerably between groups. This suggests that a consistent secondary structure in this region is not functionally critical and that the inclusion of a microsatellite-like repeat in Adoxophyes may not impair the function of the mature rRNA."

              "The mt genome of Manduca includes 7 major non-coding regions of more than 20 bp: Spacer 1 between tRNA-Gln and nad2 (54 bp); Spacer 2 between tRNA-Lys and tRNA-Asp (21 bp); Spacer 3 between tRNA-Arg and tRNA-Asn (50 bp); Spacer 4 between nad4 and nad4l (83 bp); Spacer 5 between cob and tRNA-Ser ( UCN ) (21 bp); Spacer 6 between tRNA-Ser ( UCN ) and nad1 (31 bp) and Spacer 7 between rns and tRNA-Met (322 bp). Spacer 1 is a feature common to each of the 8 lepidopteran mt genomes which have been sequenced to date but is not found in non-lepidopteran insect species. Whilst invariant between each of the two congeneric species-pairs which have been examined ( Ostrinia furnicalis and O. nubilalis ; Bombyx mori and B. mandarina ), this region shows limited sequenced conservation between even closely related lepidopteran groups such as within Bombycoidea or between bombycoids and other macrolepidopterans. Spacer 2 has also been found in several other lepidopteran species ( Adoxophyes , Coreana , Antheraea ) and while not universal within the order it is notable because while it is the only spacer region between tRNA genes found in more than one lepidopteran species these tRNAs are not separated by a spacer in any other insect group. Spacer 2 also shows limited sequence conservation between those lepidopteran species which do possess it. Spacer 3 is not found in any other lepidopteran species and shows limited sequence homology to the flanking tRNA genes suggesting that if it were derived from duplication of one of these tRNAs, considered the most frequent mode of mt genome expansion ( Lavrov et al., 2002 ), this event was not recent. Spacer 4 in Manduca has structural similarities to spacer regions in other lepidopterans but is located in a novel position within the mt genome. Spacer 4 includes (TA) 9 and (TTA) 3 microsatellite-like regions and a poly-T cluster. Other lepidopteran mt genomes have microsatellite-like regions: Adoxophyes (TATTA) 31 between tRNA-Glu and tRNA-Phe ; Bombyx (TA) 22, 11 between nad3 and tRNA-Ala , (TA) 11, 17 between tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Arg , (TA) 10, 17 between tRNA-His and nad4 , (TA) 17 , (TAA) 4 between nad6 and cob . 2 2 Differences in repeat numbers or type are for B. mandarina and B. mori respectively. In other insect orders microsatellite-like regions are confined to the control region and thus the presence of these regions interspersed through the coding regions of the genome is another distinguishing feature of lepidopteran mt genomes. Spacer region 5 is unique to Manduca and doesn't include any repetitive elements or significant sequence similarities to the other non-translated regions in this mt genome. Spacer region 6 is common to most insect mt genomes and while the region varies in size between lepidopteran species (even between congeneric species) there is a 7 bp motif, ATACTAA, which is conserved across the order, and to a lesser extent across insects, DWWCYHH ( Fig. 4 ). Spacer 5 corresponds to the binding site of mtTERM, the transcription termination peptide, and the 7 bp conserved motif is probably essential to site recognition by this protein ( Taanman, 1999 ).",
              "Spacer region 7 corresponds to the control region identified in other insects which includes the origin sites for transcription and replication ( Taanman, 1999 ). The O N (origin of minority or light strand replication) in Bombyx has the motif ATAGA preceded by an 18 bp poly-T stretch, is located 21 bp upstream from rns ( Saito et al., 2005 ). This motif is conserved across Lepidoptera including Manduca although the length of the poly-T stretch varies between species. In contrast the location of the O J (origin of majority or heavy strand replication) is less conserved in insects ( Saito et al., 2005 ) but in Drosophila is also associated with a poly-T stretch 16–21 bp upstream of tRNA-Ile . While the O J has not been experimentally determined for any lepidopteran species, each lepidopteran mt genome possesses a poly-T stretch immediately upstream of tRNA-Met suggesting that O J may be located in one of the tRNAs which flank the 3′ end of the control region. The majority of the mt control region of Manduca is made up of non-repetitive sequence but includes a microsatellite-like dinucleotide repeat region, (TA) 9 , located 210 bp from rns . Di- and trinucleotide repeats are common in the control regions of insect mt genomes, and have been found in all other lepidopteran species which have been sequenced. In lepidopterans the microsatellite region is consistently located towards the middle of the control region and is preceded by a conserved motif ATTTA. The lepidopteran mt control region is considerably more conservative in structure than most other insect groups consisting 5 readily identifiable regions: the putative O N ; a poly-T stretch; a highly variable region (150–375 bp in size); the microsatellite containing region; and a second poly-T stretch immediately upstream of tRNA-Met . The more finely divided 10-part structure for the mt control region proposed by Vila and Björklund (2004) for papilionoid butterflies is difficult to identify across the entire order but is broadly consistent with the structure reported here, i.e. Vila and Björklund (2004) subdivided the 5 regions we identify here to yield 10 regions, rather than identify entirely different boundaries between proposed regions. The macro-repeat units commonly found in other insect species are absent from all the lepidopteran species sequenced to date ( Zhang and Hweitt, 1997 )."

              "Despite the widespread use of mt genes in lepidopteran systematics the utility of different genes or regions within genes have rarely been compared to assess if the informational content of the data used was sufficient to resolve the questions examined in any particular study. Table 4 lists the size, proportion of variable and phylogenetically informative sites and molecular distances within lepidopteran genera ( Bombyx and Ostrinia ), superfamilies (Bombycoidea), higher clades (Macrolepidoptera) and the entire order for each of the protein-coding and rRNA genes compared against the mt gene regions most commonly used in lepidopteran systematics. In general the protein-coding gene alignments had very low numbers of indels (maximally 6 in nad6 ) and a high proportion of invariant sites at the amino acid sequence level suggesting that these genes will be readily alignable over broad taxonomic ranges. For example, cox1 had no indels and 415 of 537 (77.3%) sites were invariant at the amino acid sequence level across the entire order. At the nucleotide level, the gene with the highest proportion of variable sites was nad6 and the least rns ; the highest proportion of informative sites was found in atp8 and the least in rns . The most heavily used genes in lepidopteran molecular systematics, cox1 and cox2 , showed some of the lowest variability and informativeness. The combined cox1 – tRNA–Leu – cox2 amplicons commonly used similarly displayed quite low variability and inclusion of the entire 1400 bp of cox1 (sensu Landry et al., 1999 ) was not a significant improvement over using just the 300 bp at the 3′ end of cox1 (sensu Brower, 1994 ). Similarly the 660 bp DNA barcode region located at the 5′ end of cox1 was almost the least variable region of the genome examined, only rns has less variability. Roe et al. (2006) found similar results, limited differences in utility between different mitochondrial subregions, by comparing candidate 475 bp regions within the 2300 bp cox1 – cox2 amplicon. The partial nad5 region first used by Yagi et al. (1999) and subsequently used in several studies of butterfly phylogenetics is slightly more variable and informative than the full length gene (38.69 vs. 37.18 and 20.69 vs. 20.31 respectively) and could be fruitfully examined across a wider range of lepidopteran groups for its phylogenetic resolution at the interspecies/intergenus level. This analysis suggests that nad2 , nad3 , nad4 and nad6 , genes which have not previously been used in lepidopteran molecular systematics, may also prove to be very useful. Additionally, combinations of multiple genes could readily yield amplicons for analysis which have much higher variability than the current “workhorse” combination of cox1 – cox2 . The regions from atp8 to nad3 (including atp6 , cox3 and tRNA–Gly ) and from cob to nad6 are of comparable size to the cox1 to cox2 region, 1992 and 1704 bp respectively vs. 2285 bp but with much higher variability and so would likely be a more profitable target especially for studies at lower taxonomic levels. The availability of whole mt genome sequences for a wide range of lepidopteran taxa, including the derived clades Apoditrysia, Obtectomera, Macrolepidoptera and the superfamilies Tortricoidea, Pyraloidea, Bombycoidea, Papilionoidea, allows the design of primers in conserved sites to amplify these more variable regions. This ability to use mt genome data to target novel phylogenetic markers will only improve as additional genomes are sequenced and shows considerable promise for comparisons within insect orders."

              "With the sequencing of the mt genome of Manduca several general features of the mt genomes of Lepidoptera are now apparent. The derived tRNA arrangement CR-M-I-Q-Nad2 is found in all species and is a molecular synapomorphy of at least the Apoditysia. Non-coding spacer regions and microsatellite-like repeats are a common feature of lepidopteran mt genomes whereas, with the exception of the control region, they are almost absent from the genomes of other insect groups. Nucleotide composition is highly A + T biased and display strand skews consistent with asymmetrical mutation pressure. The mt genome itself provides primary sequence for the investigation of this significant model organism, particularly in light of doubts regarding its species status ( Hajibabaei et al., 2006 ), and in combination with the other 7 lepidopteran mt genomes available allows examination of the proportions of variable and informative sites for each gene at a variety of taxonomic levels within the order. These comparisons demonstrate that the “work horse” genes most widely used in lepidopteran molecular systematics, cox1 and cox2 , are amongst the least variable or informative genes within the mt genome and suggest alternative regions of the mt genome which could be more useful in future analyses."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Mitochondrial (mt) genomes of metazoan animals consist of a circular molecular, 15–20 kb in size, which encodes 37 genes including 13 protein-coding subunits from three of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes, plus the 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 22 transfer (tRNA) genes necessary to translate the protein-coding genes and non-coding control elements regulating the transcription and replication of the mt genome ( Boore, 1999; Taanman, 1999 ). To date the complete or near complete mt genomes have been sequenced from 72 insect species including 7 species from the order Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Insects are the best represented group within the invertebrates and the Lepidoptera are second only to the Diptera (flies) in terms of their mt genomic coverage (7 sp vs. 18 sp) ( Cameron et al., 2006a ). Mt genomes are available for 4 lepidopteran superfamilies: Tortricoidea ( Adoxophyes ); Pyraloidea ( Ostrinia ); Bombycoidea ( Bombyx , Antheraea ) and Papilionoidea ( Coreana ). These genomes have been studied for a variety of purposes including divergences between sibling species ( Yukuhiro et al., 2002 ), identifying gene variability between congeneric species ( Coates et al., 2005 ), to facilitate population level studies ( Kim et al., 2006 ) and to investigate relationships within the order Lepidoptera ( Lee et al., 2006 ). A major outcome of the accumulation of insect mt genome data has been the capacity to examine the utility of individual genes or regions commonly targeted for phylogenetics, phylogeography, population genetics and molecular diagnostics and to identify novel genes which could prove useful for future studies ( Nardi et al., 2003, 2005; Simon et al., 2006; Cameron and Whiting, 2007 ). As in other insect groups, mt genes have been a rich source of genetic markers in the Order Lepidoptera ( Caterino et al., 2000 ). The majority of studies have investigated the genes cox1 and cox2 , usually as a combined amplicon including either the 3′ portion of cox1 , i.e. the approx. 300 bp used in earlier studies (e.g. Brower, 1994 ), or the whole of this gene, i.e. the entire 1600 bp sequenced by later workers (e.g. Landry et al., 1999 ), plus the majority of cox2 (approx. 600 bp). A noteworthy development in the use of this region of the mt genome in lepidopteran systematics are the efforts on the DNA Barcoding initiative which have concentrated on this order ( http://www.lepbarcoding.org/ ) and by June 2007 have sequenced the 5′ half of cox1 (approx. 600 bp) for over 84,000 specimens representing 8532 lepidopteran species (e.g. Hajibabaei et al., 2006 ). Other regions of the mt genome have not been extensively used across the order however several other genes which have been used in butterfly studies ( nad5 , rns and control region) have yet to be extensively trialed in other lepidopteran superfamilies ( Pollock et al., 1998; Yagi et al., 1999; Vila and Björklund, 2004 ). Examination of entire mt genomes across the Lepidoptera will allow the testing of these well studied regions and the utilization of novel mt gene regions for molecular analysis. In the present study we sequenced the entire mt genome of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta , a member of the family Sphingidae and superfamily Bombycoidea (silkmoths and relatives) ( Kristensen and Skalski, 1999 ). This mt genome thus represents a previously unstudied family and imsproves the density of mt genome sampling within the most derived and speciose lepidopteran clade, the Macrolepidoptera. Additionally, Manduca has been extensively studied as a model organism. Since 2000, over 250 articles on Manduca have been published examining a diverse range of phenomena including its molecular biology, biomechanics, and plant–herbivore or insect–pathogen interactions. Over 3700 Manduca sequences from a diverse range of genetic systems have been deposited on GenBank. However, it is perhaps most famous to the general public as the second most commonly eaten insect on reality TV after the meal worm. Despite the significance of Manduca as a model species only limited mt gene sequence is currently available. Frohlich et al. (1996) cloned the cox1 gene cDNA of M. sexta and compared it to available cox1 sequence data from other insects. Hajibabaei et al. (2006) presented partial cox1 sequences for 15 Costa Rican Manduca species (103 specimens) including 14 specimens of M. sexta and suggest on the basis of molecular divergences that M. sexta may be a complex of at least two morphologically cryptic species. No data for any mitochondrial genes other than cox1 is available for Manduca and none for any genes other than cox1 or cox2 for any sphingid. The aims of the present study were thus to sequence the entire mt genome of M. sexta which can be used to develop molecular markers for phylogenetics, identification and species delimitation within this important model insect species and also to examine gene variability and utility across the available lepidopteran mt genomes to facilitate informed gene choice for molecular studies within this order. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Specimen collection Specimens of M. sexta were obtained from the cultures of the North Carolina State University Insectary (Yamamoto 67 Strain), preserved in 100% ethanol and stored at − 80 °C until used for DNA extraction. A voucher consisting of the whole adult moth was deposited in the BYU Life Science Museum collection, accession number IGC-LE279. 2.2 PCR amplification and sequencing Whole genomic DNA was extracted from thoracic muscle tissue with the DNeasy Tissue kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, California, USA). The entire genome of M. sexta was amplified in 6 fragments ( tRNA-Tyr – cox3 , cox3 – nad4 , nad4 – cob , cob – rnl , rnl – rns , rns – cox1 ) using long PCR. Primer sequence and location for each long PCR is listed in Table 1 . Within each long PCR product the full, double stranded sequence was determined by primer walking (primers available from SLC upon request). Long PCRs were performed using Elongase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) with the following cycling conditions: 92 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 92 °C for 30 sec, 50 °C for 30 sec, 68 °C for 12 min; and a final extension step of 68° for 20 min. Sequencing was performed using ABI BigDye ver3 dye terminator sequencing technology and run on ABI 3770 or ABI 3740 capillary sequencers. Cycle sequencing conditions were 28 cycles of 94 °C/10 sec, 50 °C/5 sec, 60 °C/4 min. 2.3 Analysis and annotation Raw sequence files were proof read and assembled into contigs in Sequencher ver. 4.6 and 4.7 (GeneCodes Corporation, Ann Arbor, Mich.). Transfer RNA analysis was conducted using tRNAscan-SE ( Lowe and Eddy, 1997 ) using invertebrate mitochondrial codon predictors and a cove score cut off of 1. Reading frames between tRNAs were found in Sequencher and identified using translated BLAST searches (blastx) ( Altschul et al., 1997 ) as implemented at the NCBI website ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). Nucleotide composition was calculated using PAUP ver4b10 ( Swofford, 2002 ). tRNA comparisons across Lepidoptera were performed in Mega ver 3.1 ( Kumar et al., 2004 ) using the secondary structures predicted by tRNAscan-SE to identify homologous sites. rRNA secondary structures were inferred using alignment to the models predicted for Drosophila ( Cannone et al., 2002 : Comparative RNA Web, http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu ), Apis ( Gillespie et al., 2006 ) and zygaenoid moths ( Niehuis et al., 2006a,b ). Stem-loops are named using both the conventions of Gillespie et al. (2006) and that of Niehuis et al. (2006a,b) with the former notation first for each time they are mentioned. Alignments of the protein coding and rRNA genes for each of the available lepidopteran mt genomes were made in Mega ver3.1 using Adoxophyes as an outgroup as this is the earliest branching lepidopteran mt genome available according to the widely accepted ordinal phylogeny of Kristensen and Skalski (1999) . Nucleotide ratios, numbers of variable and informative sites and genetic distances (uncorrected p distances) were calculated in PAUP ⁎ ver 4b10. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Genome organisation and structure The mt genome of Manduca is a circular molecule 15,516 bp in size and has been deposited in GenBank (Accession number: EU286785 ). This is comparable to the mt genome sizes reported for other lepidopterans which range from 15,314 bp in Coreana raphaelis (Lycaenidae) to 15,928 bp in Bombyx mandarina (Bombycidae) ( Yukuhiro et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2006 ). Each of the 37 genes found in a typical metazoan mt genome were present: 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and 22 transfer RNA genes. As is frequently the case with insect mt genomes, tRNA-Scan-SE failed to find a copy of tRNA-Ser ( AGN ) , which was determined by sequence comparison of the region in which this gene occurs in other insect species. The mt genome arrangement of Manduca was similar to that found in the inferred ancestral insect ( Boore, 1999 ) except for the location of tRNA-Met which is located between the control region and tRNA-Ile , giving the derived arrangement CR-M-I-Q as opposed the insect ground plan arrangement CR-I-Q-M. This arrangement, first noted by Taylor et al. (1993) in lycaenids and noctuids, has now been found in five lepidopteran superfamilies (Papilionoidea, Noctuoidea, Pyraloidea, Tortricoidea, and Bombycoidea) and is likely a shared feature of all derived moths. There also are 6 major non-coding regions including the putative control region. This is comparable to other lepidopteran species which have a higher number of non-coding regions than are typically found in other insect mt genomes. The structure of the mt genome of Manduca and the amplicons used for sequencing are given in Fig. 1 . The nucleotide composition bias of the mt genome of Manduca is 81.79% A + T, made up of 80.3% in the protein-coding genes, 85.1% in the ribosomal RNA genes and 95.4% in the control region. This is similar to the nucleotide composition biases found in other lepidopteran species which range from 82.66% for Coreana to 80.15% in Antheraea ( Table 2 ). Lepidoptera have amongst the most compositionally biased mt genomes within the insects which range from 65.6% A + T in Reticulitermes (Isoptera) to 89.3% in Apis (Hymenoptera). The nucleotide skew statistics (sensu Perna and Kocher, 1995 ) 1 1 Skew statistics measure the relative proportions of A's to T's, (A − T) / (A + T), and G's to C's (G − C) / (G + C). Positive skew indicates an excess of A's or G's whereas negative skew indicates an excess of T's and C's. The statistic scales from 0 (equal proportions of each nucleotide) to 1 (complete absence of one nucleotide). for the whole mt genome (measured on the majority strand) show that Manduca lacks significant A or T skew (− 0.00536) and has moderate C skew (0.181). This is similar to other Lepidoptera all of which have negligible A or T skew (0.0587 to − 0.0475) and moderate C-skew (0.158–0.216) and to most insect species. The only major departures from this pattern are found in insect species with significantly lower genome A + T% such as termites ( Cameron and Whiting, 2007 ) or with highly rearranged mt genomes such as lice ( Cameron et al., 2007 ). Comparing between the genes encoded on the majority strand ( cox1 , cox2 , cox3 , cob , atp6 , atp8 , nad2 , nad3 , nad6 ) and those encoded on the minority strand ( nad1 , nad4 , nad4l , nad5 ) shows that each gene set is moderately T-skewed (the balance of these opposite skews on each strand results in a lack of A/T skew in the genome as a whole), the majority gene set is moderately C-skewed and the minority set strongly G-skew (additively a strong C-skew in the entire genome) ( Table 2 ). This pattern is consistent across Lepidoptera. Considering only four-fold degenerate sites, whose nucleotide composition is evolutionarily neutral, most lepidopteran species have majority strands A/C skewed and minority stands T/G skewed. Due to asymmetrical mutation pressure on the mt genome, nucleotide composition is typically skewed in opposite directions on each strand ( Perna and Kocher, 1995; Hassasin et al., 2005 ). Antheraea and Coreana were exceptions to this pattern in which both the majority and minority strands lacked significant A or T skew. The difference between the majority mt genes as a whole, which were moderately T-skewed, and the four-fold degenerate sites, whose strong A-skew reflects asymmetrical mutation pressure favoring T-substitutions on the minority strand, suggests that active selection on nucleotide composition may be responsible for overcoming background mutation pressures (e.g. Meiklejohn et al., 2007 ). 3.2 Protein-coding genes A summary of the genes which make up the mt genome of Manduca are given in Table 3 . Twelve of the thirteen protein-coding genes use standard ATN start codons coding for I (4 genes) or M (8 genes). The exception is cox1 which uses CGA, coding for R, as a start codon. All lepidopteran species examined to date use R as the initial amino acid for cox1 and the use of non-canonical start codons for this gene is common across insects ( Fenn et al., 2007 ). Frohlich et al. (1996) have previously proposed that the start codon for cox1 in Manduca is the ATT (I) located 12 bp upstream of the CGA (R) start codon annotated here i.e. is 4 amino acids longer. This I is located 8 bp into the tRNA-Tyr gene which is encoded immediately upstream of cox1 . Overlap between tRNA-Tyr and cox1 would be unusual and indeed the actual cDNA clone sequenced by Frohlich et al. (1996) was approximately 30 bp shorter than the sequence which they published. The additional sequence reported was obtained by a separate PCR amplification of the flanking tRNAs. This shorter cDNA clone combined with the location of the tRNA suggests that cox1 is shorter than that proposed by Frohlich et al. (1996) and is consistent with annotation presented here. Of the nine protein-coding genes flanked by tRNAs at their 3′ end, four had incomplete stop codons consisting of just a T-nucleotide. Ojala et al. (1980; 1981) has proposed that polycistronic pre-mRNA transcripts are processed by endonucleases which recognize the secondary structures of tRNAs and that polyadenylation of adjacent protein-coding genes would produce functional stop-codons from partial stop codons such as a single T-nucleotide. Accordingly partial stop codons have been observed in most insect mt genomes including all lepidopteran species sequenced to date ( Yukuhiro et al., 2002; Coates et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006 ). There is also a high degree of conservation of incomplete stop codons across the order; cox1 and cox2 have incomplete stop codons in all lepidopteran species and nad5 has one in all species except Bombyx . Four of the protein-coding genes in Manduca are flanked by other protein-coding genes at the 3′ end: atp8 → atp6 ; atp6 → cox3 ; nad4l → nad4 ; nad6 → cob . Kim et al. (2006) and Fenn et al. (2007) have demonstrated that RNA secondary structures at each of these gene boundaries are likely targeting sites for endonuclease processing of the pre-mRNA, cutting between each gene liberates a mature mRNA. Secondary structures similar to those found in other Lepidoptera were found for the two genes which overlap their 3′ adjacent gene: atp8 has a stem-loop structure consisting of 9 paired-bases located 2 bp from the gene's 3′ end; and atp6 a 10 paired-base stem loop 3 bp from the end. In most insect mt genomes nad6 and cob overlap by a single base, the stop codon of the first gene also forming part of the start codon of the later. In Manduca , these genes are separated by 17 bp and the 3′ end of nad6 forms a stem-loop structure with only limited similarity to that found by Kim et al. (2006) : a 17 paired-base stem and 56 bp loop in Manduca vs. 7 base stem and 31 bp loop in Coreana . Additionally, nad4l , which typically overlaps nad4 in most insect mt genomes, in Manduca is separated from nad4 by an 83 bp spacer region, including a microsatellite-like zone, and no stem-loop structure was found in the 3′ end of nad4l . A similar gene structure is found in Bombyx spp. in which nad6 and cob are separated by a microsatellite containing spacer region ( Yukuhiro et al., 2002 ). Given that stem-loop structures both in tRNAs and the mRNAs of protein-coding genes appear to be important for the correct processing of mitochondrial genome transcripts ( Ojala et al., 1980, 1981 ), further investigation is needed into the effect of microsatellite-like regions located between genes on their transcription. 3.3 Transfer and ribosomal RNA genes Manduca had the typical set of 22 tRNA genes, one for each of the 20 amino acids with an additional isotype for each of the two 6-fold degenerate amino acids Leucine and Serine. Sequence comparisons across Lepidoptera showed limited sequence variation within the order for the functionally constrained portions of the tRNA (stems and the anticodon loop) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Variability was largely confined to the non-paired sites within the DHU and TΨC loops, however overall sequence variation within the tRNAs of Lepidoptera was much lower than that found in Diptera, the only other insect order in which such comparisons have been made ( Cameron et al., 2007 ). Within the acceptor stem, maximally 3 of the 7 paired sites were variable across the order in tRNA-Leu ( CUN ) and tRNA-Pro but were invariant for 11 of the other 21 tRNA genes. For the DHU stem tRNA-Cys was the most variable gene, 2 of 4 sites, and 10 tRNAs isotypes were invariant at this stem. tRNA-Pro and tRNA-Tyr had the most variable TΨC stems, 3 of 5 sites, however this stem was invariant in 11 tRNAs. The anticodon stem and loop had extremely low variability being invariant across Lepidoptera for 7 tRNAs and the most variable gene, tRNA-His , had only 4 of the 12 sites variable (5 stem and 7 loop nucleotides). The only exception to the generally low variability of lepidopteran tRNAs was tRNA-Gln in Adoxophyes which possesses a 34 bp repeat of approximately half the gene, including the 3′ half of the DHU stem, the entirety of the anticodon loop and the 5′ half of the TΨC stem, which should render this gene incapable of forming a functional tRNA without post-transcriptional modification. Both small ( rns ) and large ( rnl ) ribosomal subunits broadly conformed to the secondary structure models proposed for these genes from other insects ( Gillespie et al., 2006; Niehuis et al., 2006a,b ) ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). In rns there are differences in the length of stem H1047/38 and the associated stems H1068/39, H1074/40 and H1113/42 ( Niehuis et al., 2006a ), however as demonstrated by Gillespie et al. (2006) for Apis this region of rns typically yields multiple possible secondary structures within a given species and it is not clear which structures are utilized in situ . Similarly, stem H47/8 was variable between different lepidopteran species, while the terminal portion of this stem as identified by Niehuis et al. (2006a) was present in Manduca , it is absent in other bombycoids which have a correspondingly larger loop. There are several differences between the annotation of rnl in the present study and that of Niehuis et al. (2006b) . Niehuis et al. (2006b) do not annotate either the H183 or H2735 stem-loops which are respectively the first and last stem-loops of rns under Gillespie et al.'s (2006) structure. Both stem-loops could be formed from the unfolded bases reported by Niehuis et al. (2006b) at the 5′ (64 bp) and 3′ (65 bp) ends of the molecule. For H2077/G3, Niehuis et al. (2006b) proposed a 25 paired bases stem and a 4 bp loop. In contrast, for Manduca we found it consisted of a 20 paired bases stem and 22 bp loop which is more similar to that proposed for Apis , 10 paired bases stem and 32 bp loop ( Gillespie et al., 2006 ). In other Lepidoptera the extended H2077/G3 stem proposed by Niehuis et al. (2006b) is also absent as the bases do not form complementary pairs, suggesting that this feature may be confined to zygaenidoids. Niehuis et al. (2006b) also propose a very short H2347/G13 composed of just the terminal 3 paired bases, compared to the 6 which we found in Manduca . This region is also highly variable within Lepidoptera and a consistent secondary structure for it could not be found within the available lepidopteran mt genomes. Manduca also has two large insert regions within rnl relative to other lepidopterans, 19 bp in the loop between Domains II and IV and 23 bp in the loop between stems H1648/E18 and H1764/E21. None of the other lepidopterans have significant indels within either of the rRNA genes except Adoxophyes which has a (TA) 14 microsatellite-like repeat located within stem H2347/G13 of rnl which would likely introduce a significant bulge within this stem. H2347/G13 has stem-bulges in other insect species and the precise location of these bulges within the stem varies considerably between groups. This suggests that a consistent secondary structure in this region is not functionally critical and that the inclusion of a microsatellite-like repeat in Adoxophyes may not impair the function of the mature rRNA. 3.4 Non-coding regions The mt genome of Manduca includes 7 major non-coding regions of more than 20 bp: Spacer 1 between tRNA-Gln and nad2 (54 bp); Spacer 2 between tRNA-Lys and tRNA-Asp (21 bp); Spacer 3 between tRNA-Arg and tRNA-Asn (50 bp); Spacer 4 between nad4 and nad4l (83 bp); Spacer 5 between cob and tRNA-Ser ( UCN ) (21 bp); Spacer 6 between tRNA-Ser ( UCN ) and nad1 (31 bp) and Spacer 7 between rns and tRNA-Met (322 bp). Spacer 1 is a feature common to each of the 8 lepidopteran mt genomes which have been sequenced to date but is not found in non-lepidopteran insect species. Whilst invariant between each of the two congeneric species-pairs which have been examined ( Ostrinia furnicalis and O. nubilalis ; Bombyx mori and B. mandarina ), this region shows limited sequenced conservation between even closely related lepidopteran groups such as within Bombycoidea or between bombycoids and other macrolepidopterans. Spacer 2 has also been found in several other lepidopteran species ( Adoxophyes , Coreana , Antheraea ) and while not universal within the order it is notable because while it is the only spacer region between tRNA genes found in more than one lepidopteran species these tRNAs are not separated by a spacer in any other insect group. Spacer 2 also shows limited sequence conservation between those lepidopteran species which do possess it. Spacer 3 is not found in any other lepidopteran species and shows limited sequence homology to the flanking tRNA genes suggesting that if it were derived from duplication of one of these tRNAs, considered the most frequent mode of mt genome expansion ( Lavrov et al., 2002 ), this event was not recent. Spacer 4 in Manduca has structural similarities to spacer regions in other lepidopterans but is located in a novel position within the mt genome. Spacer 4 includes (TA) 9 and (TTA) 3 microsatellite-like regions and a poly-T cluster. Other lepidopteran mt genomes have microsatellite-like regions: Adoxophyes (TATTA) 31 between tRNA-Glu and tRNA-Phe ; Bombyx (TA) 22, 11 between nad3 and tRNA-Ala , (TA) 11, 17 between tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Arg , (TA) 10, 17 between tRNA-His and nad4 , (TA) 17 , (TAA) 4 between nad6 and cob . 2 2 Differences in repeat numbers or type are for B. mandarina and B. mori respectively. In other insect orders microsatellite-like regions are confined to the control region and thus the presence of these regions interspersed through the coding regions of the genome is another distinguishing feature of lepidopteran mt genomes. Spacer region 5 is unique to Manduca and doesn't include any repetitive elements or significant sequence similarities to the other non-translated regions in this mt genome. Spacer region 6 is common to most insect mt genomes and while the region varies in size between lepidopteran species (even between congeneric species) there is a 7 bp motif, ATACTAA, which is conserved across the order, and to a lesser extent across insects, DWWCYHH ( Fig. 4 ). Spacer 5 corresponds to the binding site of mtTERM, the transcription termination peptide, and the 7 bp conserved motif is probably essential to site recognition by this protein ( Taanman, 1999 ). Spacer region 7 corresponds to the control region identified in other insects which includes the origin sites for transcription and replication ( Taanman, 1999 ). The O N (origin of minority or light strand replication) in Bombyx has the motif ATAGA preceded by an 18 bp poly-T stretch, is located 21 bp upstream from rns ( Saito et al., 2005 ). This motif is conserved across Lepidoptera including Manduca although the length of the poly-T stretch varies between species. In contrast the location of the O J (origin of majority or heavy strand replication) is less conserved in insects ( Saito et al., 2005 ) but in Drosophila is also associated with a poly-T stretch 16–21 bp upstream of tRNA-Ile . While the O J has not been experimentally determined for any lepidopteran species, each lepidopteran mt genome possesses a poly-T stretch immediately upstream of tRNA-Met suggesting that O J may be located in one of the tRNAs which flank the 3′ end of the control region. The majority of the mt control region of Manduca is made up of non-repetitive sequence but includes a microsatellite-like dinucleotide repeat region, (TA) 9 , located 210 bp from rns . Di- and trinucleotide repeats are common in the control regions of insect mt genomes, and have been found in all other lepidopteran species which have been sequenced. In lepidopterans the microsatellite region is consistently located towards the middle of the control region and is preceded by a conserved motif ATTTA. The lepidopteran mt control region is considerably more conservative in structure than most other insect groups consisting 5 readily identifiable regions: the putative O N ; a poly-T stretch; a highly variable region (150–375 bp in size); the microsatellite containing region; and a second poly-T stretch immediately upstream of tRNA-Met . The more finely divided 10-part structure for the mt control region proposed by Vila and Björklund (2004) for papilionoid butterflies is difficult to identify across the entire order but is broadly consistent with the structure reported here, i.e. Vila and Björklund (2004) subdivided the 5 regions we identify here to yield 10 regions, rather than identify entirely different boundaries between proposed regions. The macro-repeat units commonly found in other insect species are absent from all the lepidopteran species sequenced to date ( Zhang and Hweitt, 1997 ). 3.5 Variability in mitochondrial genes across Lepidoptera Despite the widespread use of mt genes in lepidopteran systematics the utility of different genes or regions within genes have rarely been compared to assess if the informational content of the data used was sufficient to resolve the questions examined in any particular study. Table 4 lists the size, proportion of variable and phylogenetically informative sites and molecular distances within lepidopteran genera ( Bombyx and Ostrinia ), superfamilies (Bombycoidea), higher clades (Macrolepidoptera) and the entire order for each of the protein-coding and rRNA genes compared against the mt gene regions most commonly used in lepidopteran systematics. In general the protein-coding gene alignments had very low numbers of indels (maximally 6 in nad6 ) and a high proportion of invariant sites at the amino acid sequence level suggesting that these genes will be readily alignable over broad taxonomic ranges. For example, cox1 had no indels and 415 of 537 (77.3%) sites were invariant at the amino acid sequence level across the entire order. At the nucleotide level, the gene with the highest proportion of variable sites was nad6 and the least rns ; the highest proportion of informative sites was found in atp8 and the least in rns . The most heavily used genes in lepidopteran molecular systematics, cox1 and cox2 , showed some of the lowest variability and informativeness. The combined cox1 – tRNA–Leu – cox2 amplicons commonly used similarly displayed quite low variability and inclusion of the entire 1400 bp of cox1 (sensu Landry et al., 1999 ) was not a significant improvement over using just the 300 bp at the 3′ end of cox1 (sensu Brower, 1994 ). Similarly the 660 bp DNA barcode region located at the 5′ end of cox1 was almost the least variable region of the genome examined, only rns has less variability. Roe et al. (2006) found similar results, limited differences in utility between different mitochondrial subregions, by comparing candidate 475 bp regions within the 2300 bp cox1 – cox2 amplicon. The partial nad5 region first used by Yagi et al. (1999) and subsequently used in several studies of butterfly phylogenetics is slightly more variable and informative than the full length gene (38.69 vs. 37.18 and 20.69 vs. 20.31 respectively) and could be fruitfully examined across a wider range of lepidopteran groups for its phylogenetic resolution at the interspecies/intergenus level. This analysis suggests that nad2 , nad3 , nad4 and nad6 , genes which have not previously been used in lepidopteran molecular systematics, may also prove to be very useful. Additionally, combinations of multiple genes could readily yield amplicons for analysis which have much higher variability than the current “workhorse” combination of cox1 – cox2 . The regions from atp8 to nad3 (including atp6 , cox3 and tRNA–Gly ) and from cob to nad6 are of comparable size to the cox1 to cox2 region, 1992 and 1704 bp respectively vs. 2285 bp but with much higher variability and so would likely be a more profitable target especially for studies at lower taxonomic levels. The availability of whole mt genome sequences for a wide range of lepidopteran taxa, including the derived clades Apoditrysia, Obtectomera, Macrolepidoptera and the superfamilies Tortricoidea, Pyraloidea, Bombycoidea, Papilionoidea, allows the design of primers in conserved sites to amplify these more variable regions. This ability to use mt genome data to target novel phylogenetic markers will only improve as additional genomes are sequenced and shows considerable promise for comparisons within insect orders. 3.6 Conclusion With the sequencing of the mt genome of Manduca several general features of the mt genomes of Lepidoptera are now apparent. The derived tRNA arrangement CR-M-I-Q-Nad2 is found in all species and is a molecular synapomorphy of at least the Apoditysia. Non-coding spacer regions and microsatellite-like repeats are a common feature of lepidopteran mt genomes whereas, with the exception of the control region, they are almost absent from the genomes of other insect groups. Nucleotide composition is highly A + T biased and display strand skews consistent with asymmetrical mutation pressure. The mt genome itself provides primary sequence for the investigation of this significant model organism, particularly in light of doubts regarding its species status ( Hajibabaei et al., 2006 ), and in combination with the other 7 lepidopteran mt genomes available allows examination of the proportions of variable and informative sites for each gene at a variety of taxonomic levels within the order. These comparisons demonstrate that the “work horse” genes most widely used in lepidopteran molecular systematics, cox1 and cox2 , are amongst the least variable or informative genes within the mt genome and suggest alternative regions of the mt genome which could be more useful in future analyses.
