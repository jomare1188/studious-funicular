    "full_text": "Molecular phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the whole mitochondrial genome sequences of all 18 species/subspecies of the freshwater eels genus Anguilla to infer their phylogenetic relationships and to evaluate hypotheses about the possible dispersal routes of this genus. The Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses using a total of 15,187 sites of mitochondrial DNA sequences suggested that A. mossambica was the most basal species of anguillid eel, and that the other species (except for A. borneensis ) formed three geographic clades: Atlantic (two species), Oceania (three species), and Indo-Pacific (11 species). The present study clearly indicated a sister relationship between the Atlantic and Oceanian species, which now have distantly separated geographic distributions. This suggests that the previous hypotheses to estimate the dispersal route of anguillid eels into the Atlantic Ocean based on the current geographic distribution of species are unsupported by the present more complete analysis. Alternatively, the unique geographic distribution of the present day species in the genus Anguilla appears to have resulted from multiple dispersal events. Although the age of the beginning of speciation among anguillid eels was tentatively estimated as 20 million years ago using a calibration for bony fishes of 7.3 × 10 −4 substitutions/site/million years, it is possible that this divergence time was underestimated because of the ecological characteristics of these fishes. The results of the present study suggest that the hypotheses for the dispersal route and divergence time of the genus Anguilla should be reconsidered."

          "The freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla consist of 15 species and three subspecies ( Ege, 1939 ; but see Dijkstra and Jellyman, 1999 ) and are widely distributed in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. They all have catadromous life histories, spawn in tropical ocean waters, and their larvae are transported back to their growth habitats in freshwater or estuarine areas by warm subtropical currents ( Schmidt, 1923, 1925; Tesch, 1977; Tsukamoto, 1992 ). The continental distributions of the temperate species appear to be related to the subtropical circulation of the oceans, with most species being located along the west sides of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, except for the European eel, A. anguilla ( Ege, 1939; Watanabe, 2003 ; Fig. 1 ). However, anguillid eels are absent along the east coast of South America, despite the existence of the warm Brazil Current. Based on this geographic pattern, the Atlantic species ( A. anguilla and A. rostrata ) are geographically separated from their other congeners in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Such a unique geographic distribution has recently attracted the attention of biologists, and numerous molecular phylogenetic studies have been conducted ( Aoyama et al., 1996, 2001; Aoyama and Tsukamoto, 1997; Bastrop et al., 2000; Lehmann et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2001; Tagliavini et al., 1995, 1996; Tsukamoto and Aoyama, 1998 ; Fig. 2 ).",
          "At present, the various studies suggest different results, regarding questions such as which are the most likely dispersal routes and the most ancestral species. Aoyama and Tsukamoto (1997) were the first to propose the Tethys Corridor Hypothesis based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, in which anguillid species would have moved from their place of origin, around present day Indonesia and entered the Atlantic Ocean through the Tethys Sea, which separated Laurasia (North American and Eurasian continents) and Gondwana (Africa, South America, and India) (Route A in Figs. 1 and 2 ; see also Aoyama et al., 2001; Bastrop et al., 2000; Tsukamoto and Aoyama, 1998). Aoyama et al. (2001) further estimated that the ancestral species of Atlantic eels moved into the Atlantic Ocean at least before the closure of the Tethys Sea at around 30 million years ago (Mya) ( Haq, 1984 ), and that the genus Anguilla originated about 50–60 Mya. However, Lin et al. (2001) later suggested an opposite direction of dispersal into the Atlantic based on their molecular phylogenetic analyses and estimation of the divergence time of anguillid eels. They proposed that the adults of ancient Atlantic eels migrated from the Indo-Pacific region into the Atlantic Ocean through the Central American gateway of the Panama Isthmus, which closed around 3 Mya, because they estimated the origin of the genus Anguilla to be 20 Mya (Route B in Figs. 1 and 2 ; Lin et al., 2001 ). Another difference in these latest two studies was that Aoyama et al. (2001) proposed A. borneensis as the earliest derived species, whereas Lin et al. (2001) could not determine a likely candidate, because the first divergence in their phylogenetic tree divided 12 anguillid species into two large clades (the asterisk on the tree of Lin et al. in Fig. 2 ).",
          "These discrepancies seem to be caused by differences in taxon sampling, the analyzed genes, the amount of sequence data, and the outgroups used in each study. For example, Aoyama et al. (2001) was the only study that analyzed all species of the genus Anguilla , and used a total of 2567 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. However, the remaining studies examined at most, only two-thirds of the species in the genus and only used about 400–1800 bp of sequence data. This indicates that the genus Anguilla has only been analyzed fragmentally in terms of the number of species and the amount of sequence data, and their molecular phylogenetic relationships have not previously been comprehensively analyzed.",
          "Recently, whole mitochondrial genome sequences of many taxa including teleosts have been determined and used for phylogenetic analyses (e.g., Cooper et al., 2001; Miya et al., 2003; Nardi et al., 2003 ), which have successfully resolved some controversial phylogenetic relationships (e.g., Inoue et al., 2001a ). In this study, our objective was to reveal the molecular phylogenetic relationships of all species of the genus Anguilla using their whole mitochondrial genome sequences. We employed partitioned Bayesian analysis, because it is the only method that can incorporate the power of complex statistical models into the process with the large data set ( Holder and Lewis, 2003 ). In addition, various hypotheses for the dispersal routes of anguillid eels were examined based on the molecular phylogeny to clarify their evolutionary history."

We set five partitions (first, second, and third codon positions, rRNA, and tRNA) in the data set, assuming that functional constraints on sequence evolution are more similar within codon positions (or types of molecules) across genes than across codon positions (or types of molecules) within genes, at least for a set of mitochondrial genes. The general time reversible model with some sites assumed to be invariable and with variable sites assumed to follow a discrete gamma distribution (GTR + I + Γ ; Yang, 1994 ) was selected as the best-fit model of the nucleotide substitution by ModelTest ver. 3.06 ( Posada and Crandall, 1998 ) for all partitions. We set parameters in MrBayes as follows; “lset nst = 6,” “rates = invgamma ( I + Γ ),” “mcmc ngen = 1000,” “samplefreq = 100,” “mchains = 4,” “unlink” (unlinking of model parameters across partitions), and “prset ratepr = variable” (rate variation across partitions). Variation in the average log likelihood scores in this sample was examined graphically and each simulation was independently repeated twice. The “stationarity” (lack of improvement in ML scores) (about −71,890) was determined to have obviously occurred at around 50,000 generations. Thus, the first 1000 trees were discarded, and the posterior probabilities of the phylogeny and its branches were determined from 9001 trees.",

We counted the number of times that trees with the above sister relationships appeared in the Bayesian collection of 9001 trees to quantitatively assess the strength of support for each hypothesis (see Miller et al., 2002 )."

              "To estimate the divergence time of anguillid eels, we employed the molecular clock for bony fishes calibrated by Kumazawa et al. (1999) . They constructed phylogenetic trees, and examined the similarity of modes and rates of sequence evolution among lineages using the relative rate test on concatenated amino acid sequences of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) and cytochrome b (cyt b ) genes of a total of 21 bony fishes, with sharks as the outgroup. Consequently, they found that the molecular evolutionary rates among many of the diverse fish groups were approximately homogeneous, and the gamma-corrected distances based on these amino acid sequences were shown to provide a good estimate of pairwise distances. The molecular evolutionary rate for fishes could be calibrated using the divergence of African and neotropical cichlids at the time of the continental breakup of the African and South American landmasses (100 million years ago [Mya]), the actinopterygian vs sarcopterygian divergence (450 Mya), and the bony fish vs sharks divergence (528 Mya), which resulted in an estimate of a rate of 7.3 × 10 −4 substitutions/site/million years.",

After evaluating the rate similarity among the species of the genus Anguilla , A. japonica was selected as a representative of the genus for the following analysis. To examine whether the significant differences in the molecular evolutionary rate were detected between the genus Anguilla and other bony fishes, the same test was conducted using A. japonica plus a total of eight representative species examined by Kumazawa et al. (1999) . These species were the coelacanth ( Latimeria chalumnae ; Coelacanthdae), rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ; Salmonidae), Pacific mackerel ( Scomber japonicus ; Scombridae), Cichlasoma citrinellum (a cichlid from south America), Tylochromis polylepis (a cichlid from Africa) and the three anguilliform fishes used in the phylogenetic analyses.

The resultant topology of the 50% majority consensus tree of the 9001 trees from the Bayesian analysis suggested that A. mossambica was the most likely basal species, and that the remaining anguillid eels formed the following two large clades at basal nodes: (1) six species, A. borneensis , A. anguilla , A. rostrata , A. dieffenbachii , A. australis australis , and A. australis schmidtii ; (2) the remaining 11 species, A. japonica , A. reinhardtii , A. celebesensis , A. megastoma , A. marmorata , A. nebulosa nebulosa , A. nebulosa labiata , A. interioris , A. obscura , A. bicolor bicolor , and A. bicolor pacifica ( Fig. 3 ). In the former clade (1), A. borneensis , which is an endemic species on the east side of Borneo Island, Indonesia, was derived first.

The topology suggested that A. mossambica was the most likely basal species and the three large geographic clades of the Atlantic, Oceanian, and Indo-Pacific groups (except for A. borneensis ) were shown ( Fig. 3 ). This strongly indicated that the species comprising each geographic clade would have each shared common ancestral species. Furthermore, Bayesian posterior probabilities were mostly 100% for the nodes in this tree and were much higher than those in any previous studies, although the statistical supports cannot be directly compared.",
              "Aoyama and Tsukamoto (1997) presented a molecular phylogenetic tree with eight species that was based on 410 base pairs (bp) of cytochrome b (cyt b ) gene, and were the first to attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus Anguilla . Following that study, Bastrop et al. (2000) also conducted phylogenetic analyses using eight species and about 600 bp of the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S) gene of the mtDNA. Although their phylogenetic relationships were basically similar to those of the present study, both the number of species and the statistical support of each node were extremely small to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Anguilla . Moreover, species misidentification or cross-contamination appeared to have occurred between the South Pacific species A. reinhardtii and the East African species A. mossambica in their study ( Aoyama, 2003; Aoyama et al., 2001; Bastrop et al., 2000 ).",
              "Lin et al. (2001) later analyzed 12 anguillid species using the 12S ribosomal RNA and cyt b gene. However, they could not fully resolve the most basal relationships because the statistical support of the bootstrap replicates in their phylogenetic tree had relatively low values of less than or equal to 50% ( Fig. 2 ; Lin et al., 2001 ). Only Aoyama et al. (2001) showed a phylogenetic tree of all species of the genus Anguilla based on the 16S and cyt b gene sequences, which was about one-fifth the size of the present data set. They indicated that A. borneensis was the most basal species at the first step in their analyses and used this species as an outgroup for further analyses. However, it is doubtful that the statistical support was enough to conclude that A. borneensis was the most basal species among anguillid eels (62%, see Fig. 2 and Aoyama et al., 2001 ).",

It has been shown that longer DNA sequences can provide adequate resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of the higher-level groups of teleosts ( Miya et al., 2003 ). In this study, it appears that the longer DNA sequences also were able to resolve the relationships of closely related species at the genus level and provided a more robust phylogenetic tree."

However, there has been only fragmental information available for assessing the evolutionary history of the genus Anguilla . For example, although Lin et al. (2001) suggested the Central American gateway (the Panama route of Aoyama and Tsukamoto, 1997 ) as a possible dispersal route of anguillid eels, based on their statistical analyses using constraint trees, they did not analyze A. megastoma , which has one of the eastern most species ranges in the Pacific and had to be constrained to form a clade with the Atlantic species for statistically testing the Panama route (Route B in Figs. 1 and 2 ).",
              "The present study included all species of the genus Anguilla and is the first to provide comprehensive molecular phylogenetic information. This phylogenetic analysis using whole mitochondrial genome sequences of all species in the genus failed to support any trees with sister relationships that corresponded to the four previously hypothesized dispersal routes (Routes A–D in Fig. 1 ), according to our Bayesian analysis of 9001 trees. Furthermore, the geographically separated groups of the Atlantic and Oceanian species (plus A. borneensis ) formed a direct sister relationship with a 100% Bayesian posterior probability ( Fig. 3 ). This suggests that the previous hypotheses for the dispersal route of anguillid eels into the Atlantic Ocean, such as by Lin et al. (2001) and Aoyama et al. (2001) , were incorrect. It may be incorrect to assume that sister relationships between species having geographically close ranges can be used to elucidate their dispersal route into the Atlantic Ocean.",
              "Following the divergence of A. mossambica in the present phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 3 ), the six species of A. borneensis and the Atlantic and Oceanian species formed a clade that showed a vicariant distribution. In contrast, the geographic distributions of the 11 species in the other clade were roughly adjacent to each other. This suggests that the two large phylogenetic groups of anguillid eels have different evolutionary histories, because the present geographic distribution of the former group no longer yields information about their dispersal route, whereas the latter group retains historic geographic dispersal route information. Therefore, the evolutionary process of the genus Anguilla might not be simple, and the present geographic distribution could be attributed to, for example, multiple dispersal events, multidirectional dispersion, or past extinctions, etc. Thus, both the place of origin and the details of the dispersal process of the genus Anguilla need to be reconsidered without an emphasis on the current geographic information of present day species ranges.",
              "Using the molecular clock for bony fishes ( Kumazawa et al., 1999 ), the divergence time of S. sector and the genus Anguilla was calculated to have been about 52 million years ago (Mya) and the age of the beginning of the speciation of the extant anguillid eels was about 20 Mya. Fossil records of the Anguilliformes and the genus Anguilla have been found from the Upper Cretaceous (Aptian, about 113–119 Mya) and the Eocene (Ypresian, about 50–55 Mya), respectively ( Patterson, 1993 ). Compared to these fossil records, the present estimated divergence time was too recent. Because of certain ecological characteristics of anguillid eels, such as a relatively low level of respiration ( Matsui, 1972 ), their metabolic rate might be expected to be slow and the evolutionary rate of nucleotide substitution also might be slow ( Martin and Palumbi, 1993; Martin et al., 1992 ). Therefore, there is the possibility that the calculated divergence time based on the molecular clock for bony fishes ( Kumazawa et al., 1999 ) may be an underestimate and that the calculated divergence time in the present study was not accurate enough to estimate the age of origin or to determine the dispersal route of the anguillid eels.",
              "In the present study, we showed that a robust phylogeny of the genus Anguilla did not entirely provide clear information about the dispersal route and the divergence time of these fishes. However, recently there have been some studies that used DNA extracted from fossils (e.g., Cooper et al., 2001 ), and numerous studies that used both nuclear DNA and mtDNA sequence data (e.g., Springer et al., 2003 ), or the Bayesian approach ( Kishino et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 1998; Thorne and Kishino, 2002 ) for the estimation of the divergence times (e.g., Teeling et al., 2003 ). Therefore, to clarify the evolutionary history of the genus Anguilla , not only new genetic approaches, but also more detailed ecological information or more reliable fossil records will be essential, and the historical processes of their dispersal and speciation must be reconsidered based on these various different types of information."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction The freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla consist of 15 species and three subspecies ( Ege, 1939 ; but see Dijkstra and Jellyman, 1999 ) and are widely distributed in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. They all have catadromous life histories, spawn in tropical ocean waters, and their larvae are transported back to their growth habitats in freshwater or estuarine areas by warm subtropical currents ( Schmidt, 1923, 1925; Tesch, 1977; Tsukamoto, 1992 ). The continental distributions of the temperate species appear to be related to the subtropical circulation of the oceans, with most species being located along the west sides of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, except for the European eel, A. anguilla ( Ege, 1939; Watanabe, 2003 ; Fig. 1 ). However, anguillid eels are absent along the east coast of South America, despite the existence of the warm Brazil Current. Based on this geographic pattern, the Atlantic species ( A. anguilla and A. rostrata ) are geographically separated from their other congeners in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Such a unique geographic distribution has recently attracted the attention of biologists, and numerous molecular phylogenetic studies have been conducted ( Aoyama et al., 1996, 2001; Aoyama and Tsukamoto, 1997; Bastrop et al., 2000; Lehmann et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2001; Tagliavini et al., 1995, 1996; Tsukamoto and Aoyama, 1998 ; Fig. 2 ). At present, the various studies suggest different results, regarding questions such as which are the most likely dispersal routes and the most ancestral species. Aoyama and Tsukamoto (1997) were the first to propose the Tethys Corridor Hypothesis based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, in which anguillid species would have moved from their place of origin, around present day Indonesia and entered the Atlantic Ocean through the Tethys Sea, which separated Laurasia (North American and Eurasian continents) and Gondwana (Africa, South America, and India) (Route A in Figs. 1 and 2 ; see also Aoyama et al., 2001; Bastrop et al., 2000; Tsukamoto and Aoyama, 1998). Aoyama et al. (2001) further estimated that the ancestral species of Atlantic eels moved into the Atlantic Ocean at least before the closure of the Tethys Sea at around 30 million years ago (Mya) ( Haq, 1984 ), and that the genus Anguilla originated about 50–60 Mya. However, Lin et al. (2001) later suggested an opposite direction of dispersal into the Atlantic based on their molecular phylogenetic analyses and estimation of the divergence time of anguillid eels. They proposed that the adults of ancient Atlantic eels migrated from the Indo-Pacific region into the Atlantic Ocean through the Central American gateway of the Panama Isthmus, which closed around 3 Mya, because they estimated the origin of the genus Anguilla to be 20 Mya (Route B in Figs. 1 and 2 ; Lin et al., 2001 ). Another difference in these latest two studies was that Aoyama et al. (2001) proposed A. borneensis as the earliest derived species, whereas Lin et al. (2001) could not determine a likely candidate, because the first divergence in their phylogenetic tree divided 12 anguillid species into two large clades (the asterisk on the tree of Lin et al. in Fig. 2 ). These discrepancies seem to be caused by differences in taxon sampling, the analyzed genes, the amount of sequence data, and the outgroups used in each study. For example, Aoyama et al. (2001) was the only study that analyzed all species of the genus Anguilla , and used a total of 2567 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. However, the remaining studies examined at most, only two-thirds of the species in the genus and only used about 400–1800 bp of sequence data. This indicates that the genus Anguilla has only been analyzed fragmentally in terms of the number of species and the amount of sequence data, and their molecular phylogenetic relationships have not previously been comprehensively analyzed. Recently, whole mitochondrial genome sequences of many taxa including teleosts have been determined and used for phylogenetic analyses (e.g., Cooper et al., 2001; Miya et al., 2003; Nardi et al., 2003 ), which have successfully resolved some controversial phylogenetic relationships (e.g., Inoue et al., 2001a ). In this study, our objective was to reveal the molecular phylogenetic relationships of all species of the genus Anguilla using their whole mitochondrial genome sequences. We employed partitioned Bayesian analysis, because it is the only method that can incorporate the power of complex statistical models into the process with the large data set ( Holder and Lewis, 2003 ). In addition, various hypotheses for the dispersal routes of anguillid eels were examined based on the molecular phylogeny to clarify their evolutionary history. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Specimens All 18 species/subspecies of the genus Anguilla examined in the present study were identified based on Ege’s taxonomy ( Ege, 1939 ). One specimen of each species was used for the analysis, and they were all yellow-phase eels (except for an elver of A. anguilla ) that were sampled from their native species ranges and identified both morphologically ( Ege, 1939; Watanabe, 2003 ) and genetically (PCR-RFLP analysis of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA domain; Watanabe, 2003 ) ( Table 1 ). Tissues from live eels were immediately minced in 95% ethanol. 2.2 DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing Total genomic DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol ( Aoyama et al., 2001 ), except for those of A. anguilla , A. rostrata , A. bicolor bicolor , and A. bicolor pacifica , which were purified using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). The mitochondrial genome of each species was amplified using a long-PCR technique ( Cheng et al., 1994; Miya and Nishida, 1999 ) with seven fish-versatile primers, in addition to an anguilliformes-versatile, three Anguilla -versatile, and 18 Anguilla species-specific primers (see Appendix), which were all newly designed. The long-PCR was carried out in a Model 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) with a 25 μl reaction volume containing 8.75 μl of sterile distilled water, 2.5 μl of 10× LA PCR buffer (Takara), 2.5 μl MgCl 2 , 4.0 μl dNTP (2.5 mM each), 1.0 μl of each primer (5 μM), 1.25 U LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), and 5 μl of the total genomic DNA. Typical amplification parameters were 30–35 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 10 s, annealing and extension at 60–68°C for 16 min after heating at 98°C for 5 min. Long-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.0% LO3 agarose gel (Takara), later stained with ethidium bromide for band characterization via ultraviolet transillumination, and diluted (1:5–20) for subsequent use as PCR templates. A total of 147 fish-versatile, and both an Anguilla -versatile and 60 Anguilla species-specific primers (see Appendix), which were newly designed, were used in various combinations to amplify fragments covering the entire mitochondrial genome. Subsequent PCR were also done in the Model 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) with a 15 μl reaction volume containing 8.64 μl of sterile distilled water, 1.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Takara), 1.2 μl dNTP (2.5 mM each), 1.5 μl of each primer (5 μM), 0.3 U Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), and 0.6 μl of template. Typical amplification parameters were 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, annealing at 50°C for 15 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s after heating at 94°C for 5 min. The PCR products were confirmed as described above. Double-stranded PCR products were purified using a Pre-Sequencing Kit (USB), which employs the shrimp alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease to remove excess dNTPs and oligonucleotides. All sequencing reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems) with the same primers as those for PCR. Labeled fragments were analyzed on a Model 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) or a Model 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). All sequences have been registered in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under Accession nos. AP007233–AP007249. 2.3 Phylogenetic analysis The sequences of three anguilliform fishes, conger eel ( Conger myriaster , Congridae; Inoue et al., 2001c ; AB038381), cutthroat eel ( Synaphobrancus kaupii , Synaphobranchidae; Inoue et al., 2004 ; AP002977) and sawtooth eel ( Serrivomer sector , Serrivomeridae; AP007250), were collectively used as outgroups according to analyses of Inoue (1997) and Inoue et al. (2004) . The individual gene sequences for the 21 total species were aligned manually using DNASIS version 3.7 (Hitachi Software Engineering). Amino acid and secondary structure models ( Gutell, 1994; Gutell et al., 1993; Inoue et al., 2001b; Wang and Lee, 2002 , for ribosomal RNA [rRNA], Inoue et al., 2001b; Kumazawa and Nishida, 1993 , for transfer RNA [tRNA]) were used for alignments of the protein-coding genes and RNA genes, respectively. The control region and other ambiguous alignment regions were excluded from the analysis. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted with MrBayes 3.0b4 ( Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003 ). We set five partitions (first, second, and third codon positions, rRNA, and tRNA) in the data set, assuming that functional constraints on sequence evolution are more similar within codon positions (or types of molecules) across genes than across codon positions (or types of molecules) within genes, at least for a set of mitochondrial genes. The general time reversible model with some sites assumed to be invariable and with variable sites assumed to follow a discrete gamma distribution (GTR + I + Γ ; Yang, 1994 ) was selected as the best-fit model of the nucleotide substitution by ModelTest ver. 3.06 ( Posada and Crandall, 1998 ) for all partitions. We set parameters in MrBayes as follows; “lset nst = 6,” “rates = invgamma ( I + Γ ),” “mcmc ngen = 1000,” “samplefreq = 100,” “mchains = 4,” “unlink” (unlinking of model parameters across partitions), and “prset ratepr = variable” (rate variation across partitions). Variation in the average log likelihood scores in this sample was examined graphically and each simulation was independently repeated twice. The “stationarity” (lack of improvement in ML scores) (about −71,890) was determined to have obviously occurred at around 50,000 generations. Thus, the first 1000 trees were discarded, and the posterior probabilities of the phylogeny and its branches were determined from 9001 trees. Heuristic ML analyses with tree bisection–reconnection branch-swapping were conducted using PAUP* 4.0b10 ( Swofford, 2002 ). The GTR + I + Γ model ( Yang, 1994 ) was used. The parameters were optimized on the Bayesian tree topology. 2.4 Estimation of the dispersal route into the Atlantic Ocean The dispersal route of anguillid eels from the Indo-Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean was evaluated by looking for support for the four hypothesized dispersal routes that were based on the present day geographic distribution of species. The following four hypothesized sister relationships have been suggested to represent different routes: ( A. mossambica , ( A. anguilla , A. rostrata )) for the Tethys Sea route (Route A in Fig. 1 ): they passed through the Tethys Sea, and for the Cape of Good Hope route (Route C in Fig. 1 ): their dispersion was via the southern tip of Africa instead of through the Tethys Sea (see Aoyama and Tsukamoto, 1997 ); ( A. megastoma , ( A. anguilla , A. rostrata )) for the Panama route (Route B in Fig. 1 ): they moved eastward in the Pacific Ocean and across the Central American gateway; ( A. japonica , ( A. anguilla , A. rostrata )) for the Arctic route (Route D in Fig. 1 ): the ancestral eels migrated through the Arctic Ocean. We counted the number of times that trees with the above sister relationships appeared in the Bayesian collection of 9001 trees to quantitatively assess the strength of support for each hypothesis (see Miller et al., 2002 ). 2.5 Estimation of the divergence time To estimate the divergence time of anguillid eels, we employed the molecular clock for bony fishes calibrated by Kumazawa et al. (1999) . They constructed phylogenetic trees, and examined the similarity of modes and rates of sequence evolution among lineages using the relative rate test on concatenated amino acid sequences of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) and cytochrome b (cyt b ) genes of a total of 21 bony fishes, with sharks as the outgroup. Consequently, they found that the molecular evolutionary rates among many of the diverse fish groups were approximately homogeneous, and the gamma-corrected distances based on these amino acid sequences were shown to provide a good estimate of pairwise distances. The molecular evolutionary rate for fishes could be calibrated using the divergence of African and neotropical cichlids at the time of the continental breakup of the African and South American landmasses (100 million years ago [Mya]), the actinopterygian vs sarcopterygian divergence (450 Mya), and the bony fish vs sharks divergence (528 Mya), which resulted in an estimate of a rate of 7.3 × 10 −4 substitutions/site/million years. The molecular evolutionary rates were compared among the species of the genus Anguilla by the relative rate test using RRTree ( Robinson-Rechavi and Huchon, 2000 ) with the amino acid sequences of the ND2 and cyt b genes, and S. sector as an outgroup. After evaluating the rate similarity among the species of the genus Anguilla , A. japonica was selected as a representative of the genus for the following analysis. To examine whether the significant differences in the molecular evolutionary rate were detected between the genus Anguilla and other bony fishes, the same test was conducted using A. japonica plus a total of eight representative species examined by Kumazawa et al. (1999) . These species were the coelacanth ( Latimeria chalumnae ; Coelacanthdae), rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ; Salmonidae), Pacific mackerel ( Scomber japonicus ; Scombridae), Cichlasoma citrinellum (a cichlid from south America), Tylochromis polylepis (a cichlid from Africa) and the three anguilliform fishes used in the phylogenetic analyses. The tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier , was used as an outgroup, following Kumazawa et al. (1999) . A neighbor-joining tree ( Saitou and Nei, 1987 ) was constructed using PHYLIP 3.57c ( Felsenstein, 1995 ) based on the gamma-corrected genetic distances from the amino acid sequences of ND2 and cyt b genes calculated using Tree-puzzle ver. 5.0 ( Schmidt et al., 2000 ) for all anguillid eels and the three anguilliform fishes as outgroups. We calculated the divergence time of each node for all species and finally decided the estimated divergence time by the average. 3 Results 3.1 Phylogenetic analysis We obtained a total of 15,187 nucleotide positions (11,394 sites for the protein-coding genes, 1468 sites for the tRNA genes, and 2325 sites for the rRNA genes) from the whole mitochondrial genome sequences and used these in the phylogenetic analysis. The resultant topology of the 50% majority consensus tree of the 9001 trees from the Bayesian analysis suggested that A. mossambica was the most likely basal species, and that the remaining anguillid eels formed the following two large clades at basal nodes: (1) six species, A. borneensis , A. anguilla , A. rostrata , A. dieffenbachii , A. australis australis , and A. australis schmidtii ; (2) the remaining 11 species, A. japonica , A. reinhardtii , A. celebesensis , A. megastoma , A. marmorata , A. nebulosa nebulosa , A. nebulosa labiata , A. interioris , A. obscura , A. bicolor bicolor , and A. bicolor pacifica ( Fig. 3 ). In the former clade (1), A. borneensis , which is an endemic species on the east side of Borneo Island, Indonesia, was derived first. Subsequently, the geographically widely separated groups of the two species ( A. anguilla and A. rostrata , the Atlantic group) and three species of the Oceanian group ( A. dieffenbachii , A. australis australis , and A. australis schmidtii ), were split. In the latter clade (2) with 11 species of the Indo-Pacific group, A. celebesensis and A. megastoma , A. nebulosa nebulosa and A. nebulosa labiata , A. bicolor bicolor and A. bicolor pacifica showed sister relationships. With the exception of only two nodes, all internal branches were supported by 100% Bayesian posterior probabilities. The maximum likelihood analysis using the same model and data set showed an identical topology (Ln likelihood = −76,540.0) to the Bayesian analysis, except for the positions of A. japonica and A. reinhardtii , which were switched. 3.2 Estimation of the dispersal route into the Atlantic Ocean Of the assumed sister relationships for the four possible dispersal routes, no trees with those affinities were included in the Bayesian collection of 9001 trees. This means that all of the four possible relationships hypothesized from the present geographic distributions of anguillid species were statistically rejected. The Atlantic species were strongly suggested to have a sister relationship with the Oceanian species, which does not provide support for any of the four previous hypotheses for the route of dispersal of anguillid eels into the Atlantic Ocean. 3.3 Estimation of the divergence time No significant difference in molecular evolutionary rate was found among all lineages tested in the present study (data not shown). The estimated divergence time between the genus Anguilla and S. sector was 52 million years ago (Mya). Among anguillid eels, the calculated divergence times were as follows: 15.7 Mya for the divergence of A. borneensis and the Atlantic + Oceanian group; 5.8 Mya for A. anguilla and A. rostrata ; 11.7 Mya for that of A. celebesensis and A. megastoma ; 1.9 Mya for A. nebulosa nebulosa and A. nebulosa labiata ; and 1.6 Mya for A. bicolor bicolor and A. bicolor pacifica . The beginning of the speciation of the extant anguillid species was estimated as 20 Mya. 4 Discussion 4.1 Phylogenetic relationships The present phylogenetic tree was the first to be constructed based on the whole mitochondrial genome sequences for all species of the genus Anguilla . The topology suggested that A. mossambica was the most likely basal species and the three large geographic clades of the Atlantic, Oceanian, and Indo-Pacific groups (except for A. borneensis ) were shown ( Fig. 3 ). This strongly indicated that the species comprising each geographic clade would have each shared common ancestral species. Furthermore, Bayesian posterior probabilities were mostly 100% for the nodes in this tree and were much higher than those in any previous studies, although the statistical supports cannot be directly compared. Aoyama and Tsukamoto (1997) presented a molecular phylogenetic tree with eight species that was based on 410 base pairs (bp) of cytochrome b (cyt b ) gene, and were the first to attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus Anguilla . Following that study, Bastrop et al. (2000) also conducted phylogenetic analyses using eight species and about 600 bp of the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S) gene of the mtDNA. Although their phylogenetic relationships were basically similar to those of the present study, both the number of species and the statistical support of each node were extremely small to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Anguilla . Moreover, species misidentification or cross-contamination appeared to have occurred between the South Pacific species A. reinhardtii and the East African species A. mossambica in their study ( Aoyama, 2003; Aoyama et al., 2001; Bastrop et al., 2000 ). Lin et al. (2001) later analyzed 12 anguillid species using the 12S ribosomal RNA and cyt b gene. However, they could not fully resolve the most basal relationships because the statistical support of the bootstrap replicates in their phylogenetic tree had relatively low values of less than or equal to 50% ( Fig. 2 ; Lin et al., 2001 ). Only Aoyama et al. (2001) showed a phylogenetic tree of all species of the genus Anguilla based on the 16S and cyt b gene sequences, which was about one-fifth the size of the present data set. They indicated that A. borneensis was the most basal species at the first step in their analyses and used this species as an outgroup for further analyses. However, it is doubtful that the statistical support was enough to conclude that A. borneensis was the most basal species among anguillid eels (62%, see Fig. 2 and Aoyama et al., 2001 ). In comparison with the above-mentioned phylogenetic trees in the previous studies, the present phylogenetic tree based on the whole mitochondrial genome sequence data of all species was more robust and reliable. It has been shown that longer DNA sequences can provide adequate resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of the higher-level groups of teleosts ( Miya et al., 2003 ). In this study, it appears that the longer DNA sequences also were able to resolve the relationships of closely related species at the genus level and provided a more robust phylogenetic tree. 4.2 Evolutionary history of the genus Anguilla After Aoyama and Tsukamoto (1997) proposed the Tethys Sea hypothesis (Route A in Figs. 1 and 2 ), there has been additional discussions about how and when the anguillid eels entered the Atlantic Ocean. However, there has been only fragmental information available for assessing the evolutionary history of the genus Anguilla . For example, although Lin et al. (2001) suggested the Central American gateway (the Panama route of Aoyama and Tsukamoto, 1997 ) as a possible dispersal route of anguillid eels, based on their statistical analyses using constraint trees, they did not analyze A. megastoma , which has one of the eastern most species ranges in the Pacific and had to be constrained to form a clade with the Atlantic species for statistically testing the Panama route (Route B in Figs. 1 and 2 ). The present study included all species of the genus Anguilla and is the first to provide comprehensive molecular phylogenetic information. This phylogenetic analysis using whole mitochondrial genome sequences of all species in the genus failed to support any trees with sister relationships that corresponded to the four previously hypothesized dispersal routes (Routes A–D in Fig. 1 ), according to our Bayesian analysis of 9001 trees. Furthermore, the geographically separated groups of the Atlantic and Oceanian species (plus A. borneensis ) formed a direct sister relationship with a 100% Bayesian posterior probability ( Fig. 3 ). This suggests that the previous hypotheses for the dispersal route of anguillid eels into the Atlantic Ocean, such as by Lin et al. (2001) and Aoyama et al. (2001) , were incorrect. It may be incorrect to assume that sister relationships between species having geographically close ranges can be used to elucidate their dispersal route into the Atlantic Ocean. Following the divergence of A. mossambica in the present phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 3 ), the six species of A. borneensis and the Atlantic and Oceanian species formed a clade that showed a vicariant distribution. In contrast, the geographic distributions of the 11 species in the other clade were roughly adjacent to each other. This suggests that the two large phylogenetic groups of anguillid eels have different evolutionary histories, because the present geographic distribution of the former group no longer yields information about their dispersal route, whereas the latter group retains historic geographic dispersal route information. Therefore, the evolutionary process of the genus Anguilla might not be simple, and the present geographic distribution could be attributed to, for example, multiple dispersal events, multidirectional dispersion, or past extinctions, etc. Thus, both the place of origin and the details of the dispersal process of the genus Anguilla need to be reconsidered without an emphasis on the current geographic information of present day species ranges. Using the molecular clock for bony fishes ( Kumazawa et al., 1999 ), the divergence time of S. sector and the genus Anguilla was calculated to have been about 52 million years ago (Mya) and the age of the beginning of the speciation of the extant anguillid eels was about 20 Mya. Fossil records of the Anguilliformes and the genus Anguilla have been found from the Upper Cretaceous (Aptian, about 113–119 Mya) and the Eocene (Ypresian, about 50–55 Mya), respectively ( Patterson, 1993 ). Compared to these fossil records, the present estimated divergence time was too recent. Because of certain ecological characteristics of anguillid eels, such as a relatively low level of respiration ( Matsui, 1972 ), their metabolic rate might be expected to be slow and the evolutionary rate of nucleotide substitution also might be slow ( Martin and Palumbi, 1993; Martin et al., 1992 ). Therefore, there is the possibility that the calculated divergence time based on the molecular clock for bony fishes ( Kumazawa et al., 1999 ) may be an underestimate and that the calculated divergence time in the present study was not accurate enough to estimate the age of origin or to determine the dispersal route of the anguillid eels. In the present study, we showed that a robust phylogeny of the genus Anguilla did not entirely provide clear information about the dispersal route and the divergence time of these fishes. However, recently there have been some studies that used DNA extracted from fossils (e.g., Cooper et al., 2001 ), and numerous studies that used both nuclear DNA and mtDNA sequence data (e.g., Springer et al., 2003 ), or the Bayesian approach ( Kishino et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 1998; Thorne and Kishino, 2002 ) for the estimation of the divergence times (e.g., Teeling et al., 2003 ). Therefore, to clarify the evolutionary history of the genus Anguilla , not only new genetic approaches, but also more detailed ecological information or more reliable fossil records will be essential, and the historical processes of their dispersal and speciation must be reconsidered based on these various different types of information.
