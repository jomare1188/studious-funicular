    "full_text": "The polyembryonic parasitoid Copidosoma floridanum produces two larval castes, soldiers and reproductives, during development within its host. Soldier larvae defend the brood against competitors while reproductive larvae develop into adult wasps. As with other caste-forming insects, the distinct morphological and behavioral features of soldier and reproductive larvae likely involve differential gene expression. In this study we used a bi-directional suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach to isolate differentially expressed genes from C. floridanum soldier and reproductive larvae. We isolated 230 novel expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the two subtractions (114 soldier/116 reproductive ESTs). Among these ESTs were sequences with significant similarity to genes coding for serine proteinases, proteinase inhibitors, odorant-binding and chemosensory proteins, and cuticular proteins. Also, three novel genes were isolated that resemble one another in conceptual translation and share the cysteine spacing pattern of short scorpion toxins and insect defensins. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of 20 ESTs from the two libraries indicated that 85% were differentially expressed in one caste or the other. We conclude that our SSH strategy was effective in identifying a number of genes differentially expressed in soldier and reproductive larvae and that several of these genes will be useful in characterizing caste-specific gene networks in C. floridanum ."

          "A key characteristic of advanced social insects is the evolution of behaviorally and often morphologically specialized castes. One caste invariably consists of individuals that reproduce while others consist of individuals that are functionally sterile and perform helper tasks. Caste determination is usually regulated by environmental stimuli such as diet or temperature rather than genotype ( Kumaran, 1983 ; Wheeler, 1986 ; Julian et al., 2002 ; Ashe and Oldroyd, 2002 ; Cahan and Keller, 2003 ). Perception of these environmental cues in turn stimulates changes in gene expression and physiological processes that result in development into one caste or another. Precisely how these changes in gene expression regulate caste fate or the functions castes subsequently perform is poorly understood ( Evans and Wheeler, 2001 ; Whitfield et al., 2003 ).",
          "Among the most unusual caste-forming insects are polyembryonic wasps in the family Encyrtidae ( Strand and Grbic, 1997 ; Grbic, 2000 ; Strand, 2003 ). These insects are obligate parasitoids whose eggs give rise to multiple, genetically identical offspring. The most studied polyembryonic wasp is Copidosoma floridanum . This parasitoid oviposits into the egg stage of the moth Trichoplusia ni . After parasitism the host egg hatches and the caterpillar develops to its final (fifth) instar. During this period, the wasp egg undergoes a clonal phase of development that results in production of as many as 3000 embryos that form an assemblage called a polymorula. Up to 24% of these embryos develop during the host's first–fourth instars into obligately sterile soldier larvae. Soldier larvae have a characteristically serpentine body form, feed minimally on the host and never molt ( Fig. 1 ). However, soldiers readily defend their clonal siblings by attacking inter- and intraspecific parasitoid competitors that attempt to utilize the host ( Grbic et al., 1992 ; Harvey et al., 2000 ; Giron et al., 2004 ). The remaining embryos in the polymorula develop into reproductive larvae during the host's fifth instar. Reproductive larvae have a more rounded morphology than soldiers and undergo two instars in the course of host consumption ( Fig. 1 ). Reproductive larvae also differ from soldiers in that they are completely non-aggressive toward competitors. Following consumption of the host, reproductive larvae pupate inside the remnant host cuticle and subsequently emerge as adult wasps. Soldier larvae in contrast always die after their reproductive siblings consume the host.",
          "Early workers were unclear as to how caste formation could be regulated in polyembryonic wasps because all of the embryos in a brood are genetically identical, develop in close proximity to one another in a polymorula, and are exposed to identical environmental conditions in the host ( Patterson, 1921 ; Silvestri, 1937 ; Ivanova-Kasas, 1972 ; Cruz, 1981 ). More recent studies have shown that caste fate in C. floridanum is mediated by a developmental asymmetry that results in differential allocation of germ cells to embryos ( Donnell et al., 2004 ; Zhurov et al., 2004 ). Similar to other phylogenetically advanced insects, primordial germ cells (PGCs) in C. floridanum are specified early in embryogenesis via inheritance of maternal determinants ( Extavour and Akam, 2003 ; Extavour, 2004 ). Unlike other insects, however, PGCs in C. floridanum proliferate substantially during the clonal phase of development and are asymmetrically parceled to embryos. Embryos that inherit germ cells develop into reproductive larvae while embryos that do not develop into soldiers ( Donnell et al., 2004 ; Zhurov et al., 2004 ). The proportion of embryos that inherit germ cells is also responsive to changes in environmental conditions. This phenotypic plasticity allows C. floridanum to adaptively shift ratios of investment in soldier and reproductive larvae as a function of the level of risk posed by competitors ( Harvey et al., 2000 ).",
          "How the presence or absence of germ cells causes caste-specific differences in morphology, physiology, and behavior is unknown. As in other caste-forming insects, however, these differences must be due in part to differential gene expression between embryos that develop into soldiers and reproductives. Differential gene expression likely persists once soldier and reproductive larvae eclose given their distinctly different functional activities. Most studies on caste-specific patterns in gene expression have focused on advanced social insects like the honeybee ( Evans and Wheeler, 1999, 2000 ; Hepperle and Hartfelder, 2001 ; Robinson, 2002 ; Calvello et al., 2005 ), termites ( Miura et al., 1999 ; Scharf et al., 2003 ) and ants ( Abouheif and Wray, 2002 ; Tian et al., 2004 ). More limited data have also been gathered for the bumblebee ( Pereboom et al., 2005 ) and caste-forming aphids ( Kutsukake et al., 2004 ). In this study, we focused on identifying differentially expressed genes in the reproductive and soldier larvae of C. floridanum by using a bi-directional suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach. Our screen identified more than 200 novel sequences of which 94 showed significant similarity to known genes. Several of these sequences were classified into categories of potential significance to the functions of soldier and reproductive larvae."

SSH involves hybridization of an experimental (tester) cDNA population to an excess of a reference (driver) cDNA population followed by PCR amplification and cloning of the unhybridized, and thus novel or rare, tester cDNA sequences. We isolated total RNA from C. floridanum soldier and reproductive larvae using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by further purification using a High Prime kit (Roche). mRNA was then isolated using Oligotex beads (Qiagen) and quantified using RiboGreen reagent (Molecular Probes) and a Fluostar Galaxy platereader (BMG). A SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) was used to produce 2 μg of tester and driver cDNA for each subtraction using 250 ng of mRNA from each caste as template. Following digestion of cDNA pools with Rsa I a PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) was used for adaptor ligation and subtraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Products resulting from the SSH procedure were amplified on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermocycler using Advantage2 Polymerase reagents (BD Bioscience)."

Selected white colonies were grown in 2 mL LB-ampicillin media overnight at 37 °C. The plasmid DNA was then harvested using a FastPlasmid kit (Eppendorf). Sequencing reactions were run using ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing reagents. Samples were then sequenced by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI). All sequences were used to query the GenBank/EMBL database with the BLASTX program ( Altschul et al., 1997 ) in June 2005. Conceptual translations of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with significant similarity to known genes were used to search for conserved domains using the CD-Search program ( Marchler-Bauer and Bryant, 2004 ) in the course of BLASTP searches ( Altschul et al., 1997 ).",

The fragments from these reactions were visualized on EtBr-stained agarose gels, isolated using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and then subcloned into a pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Inserts were sequenced as described above. Putatively full-length cDNAs were then assembled from the overlapping sequences using the Seqman program (DNASTAR, Inc.).

As outlined by Diatchenko and colleagues (1996) , this procedure incorporates a cDNA normalization step with suppression PCR to selectively amplify rare and novel transcripts in the population of interest. Each of the resulting soldier and reproductive SSH libraries produced approximately 4000 colonies of which approximately 40% were white. The average insert size for twenty clones randomly selected from each library was 520 bp. We then selected an additional 180 clones from each library such that a total of 400 clones were sequenced.",
              "A summary of the results is presented in Table 1 . A total of 365 clones produced usable sequence data of which 230 contained novel ESTs. These ESTs were submitted to GenBank and assigned the accessions nos. DV181803 – DV182032 . The remaining 135 clones contained duplicate sequences. Only 30 duplicate sequences were encountered in the first 200 clones we sequenced (100 soldier and 100 reproductive), whereas 105 duplicates were obtained in the last 200 clones. This indicated that each subtraction library contained novel clones above the 200 we sequenced but that the rate at which we recovered novel clones had rapidly declined by the time random sequencing was stopped.",

This analysis identified 94 ESTs with significant similarity to characterized genes, 11 ESTs with similarity to uncharacterized genes and 125 ESTs (54%) with no similarity to known genes ( Table 1 ). After inspection of these data, we subdivided the ESTs with significant BLASTX scores into six categories: enzymes, proteinase inhibitors, odorant-binding and chemosensory proteins, cuticular proteins, cysteine-rich peptides, and miscellaneous. A complete list of identified transcripts is presented in Table 2 . ESTs in each category are described in more detail below along with expression data for genes corresponding to ESTs used to determine if the SSH libraries were enriched for differentially expressed transcripts."

                  "SPs are characterized by a signature domain that includes a catalytic triad comprised of an invariant histidine, aspartic acid, and serine residue. SPs are functionally diverse with especially important roles in digestion, immunity, and development ( Terra and Ferreira, 1994 ; Misra et al., 1998 ; Muharsini et al., 2000 ; Jiang and Kanost, 2000 ; Theopold et al., 2004 ). Organisms also commonly encode genes with SP signature domains that lack one or more of the invariant residues in the catalytic triad. These genes are referred to as SP homologs (SPHs) ( Ross et al., 2003 ).",
                  "We identified 21 ESTs with trypsin-like serine proteinase domains (conserved domain cd00190; see Table 2 ), but sequence data was often insufficient to determine whether a given EST had an intact catalytic triad. The vast majority (81%) of these ESTs were isolated from the soldier library. Five ESTs from the soldier library (S7, S32, S48, S49, S191) were most similar to two trypsin-like SP genes from Drosophila melanogaster ( Table 2 ). Alignments indicated that these ESTs differed from one another suggesting that C. floridanum encodes several closely related trypsin-like SPs (data not presented). Two other soldier ESTs (S19 and S34) were most similar to genes coding for SPs with immune-related functions in mammals, while a third (S103) was most similar to an SP gene from the fly Sarcophaga peregrina that has been implicated in autolysis of the midgut during metamorphosis ( Nakajima et al., 1997 ; Tsuji et al., 1998 ) ( Table 2 ). The putative SP partially encoded by S103, however, is unlikely to have a similar function given that soldier larvae never molt.",
                  "Only four ESTs with similarity to SP/SPH genes were identified from the reproductive library. R107 and R162 had modest but significant similarity to digestive trypsin and chymotrypsin genes, while R2 and R36 shared more significant similarity to a gene coding for a predicted prophenoloxidase-activating factor (PAF) from the honeybee Apis mellifera ( Table 2 ). Alignment of R2 and R36 revealed that these ESTs partially overlapped to form a contiguous sequence. Conceptual translation of this sequence revealed coding regions for the histidine and aspartic acid residues of a catalytic triad but the essential serine was replaced by a glycine indicating that R2 and R36 code for an SPH. PAFs regulate activation of prophenoloxidase (proPO) ( Ashida and Brey, 1998 ; Jiang and Kanost, 2000 ) and certain PAF-like SPHs facilitate this process ( Yu et al., 2003 ). Recently, however, a PAF-like SPH was identified from the venom gland of the endoparasitic wasp Cotesia rubecula that significantly reduced the proteolysis of proPO by its host ( Asgari et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2004 ). Alignments indicate that the C. rubecula and C. floridanum SPHs share significant sequence similarity as well as the glycine for serine replacement in the catalytic triad (data not presented). Whether or not the C. floridanum SPH interacts with the host proPO cascade is currently under investigation.",
                  "We selected six of the SP/SPH ESTs for RT-PCR analysis (S4, S19, S32, S103, R2, R162) to determine whether they were differentially expressed in soldier and reproductive larvae. Our results indicated that each EST from the soldier library was either specifically or preferentially expressed in soldiers ( Fig. 2 ). Reciprocally, R2 and R162 were expressed in first and second instar reproductive larvae but not in soldiers. We also detected expression of R2 but not R162 in adult wasps. These results indicated that each subtracted library was enriched for differentially expressed SPs or SPHs. They also suggest that C. floridanum encodes SP or SPH genes with caste-specific functions. At this time we can only speculate as to what those functions might be although two possibilities are especially attractive. As previously noted, soldier larvae feed minimally on the host but readily attack and kill competitors ( Giron et al., 2004 ). Thus, soldiers may introduce SPs or other proteinases into competitors during combat. An example of this was recently found for a digestive proteinase produced by soldiers of the social aphid Tuberaphis styraci ( Kutsukake et al., 2004 ). Hosts parasitized by C. floridanum exhibit very few alterations in development until the reproductive larvae molt to the second instar at which time host tissues rapidly degenerate ( Baehrecke et al., 1993 ; Strand and Grbic, 1997 ). The rapid breakdown of host tissues at this time circumstantially suggests that second instar reproductives secrete digestive enzymes like trypsins and chymotrypsins into the host to facilitate its consumption. Extraoral digestion of host tissues has been observed in other endoparasitic wasps ( Quicke, 1997 , for review)."

S9 partially encoded a protein with a putative signal peptide, suggestive of secretion, and significant similarity to a carboxylesterase from A. mellifera . S145 encoded a transglutaminase core domain (Protein family code pfam01841) and shared significant similarity with a hypothetical transglutaminase gene identified in the genome of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae . The nine ESTs from the reproductive larva library included R109 and R148 that contain coding regions for a lipase (cd00741) and glycosyl hydrolase (pfam00232) domain, respectively. These features suggest the corresponding genes have digestive functions. The seven remaining ESTs were related to genes that coded for other enzymes including translocases and a glutathione S-transferase ( Table 2 ).

In addition, an EST from the soldier library (S147) exhibited significant similarity to a gene from A. mellifera coding for a putative kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor while the only reproductive EST (R28) found to contain sequence similarity to proteinase inhibitors also encoded a kazal domain ( Table 2 ). Kazal domains (cd00104) have been identified in a range of proteinase inhibitors including anti-thrombins. Contrary to expectation, S143 was expressed in both soldiers and second instar reproductives indicating that this EST is not a soldier-specific gene product ( Fig. 2 ). Expression of R28, however, was caste-specific with expression restricted to second instar reproductives ( Fig. 2 ). Sequence analysis further indicated that R28 contained both the 5′ SMART adaptor sequence and a polyA tract suggesting this EST was a full-length cDNA. The highest similarity matches to R28 were to two insect genes: (1) a putative proteinase inhibitor identified from larval stage Lonomia obliqua (Lepidoptera) which induce hemorrhagic responses when touched ( Kelen et al., 1996 ), and (2) a thiol proteinase inhibitor expressed in the midgut of the biting midge Culicoides sonorensis ( Campbell et al., 2005 )."

OBPs are distinguished by the spacing of six cysteine residues that form three internal disulfide bridges ( Vogt et al., 1991 ; Angeli et al., 1999 ). Sequence conservation among OBP family members outside of these conserved cysteines is poor. CSPs are more conserved in their amino acid sequences than OBPs and contain four cysteine residues that form two internal disulfide bridges ( Scaloni et al., 1999 ; Calvello et al., 2003 ). OBPs and CSPs are both thought to facilitate chemical communication by binding hydrophobic molecules in the lymph of chemosensory structures and transporting them to transmembrane receptors on the surface of dendrites ( Vogt et al., 1985 ; Pelosi et al., 2005 ). However, expression of OBPs and CSPs has also been detected in a number of non-sensory tissues suggesting some of these proteins may have transport functions unrelated to chemoreception ( Pelosi et al., 2005 ).",
              "In this study, one EST from the soldier library (S56) and another (R21) from the reproductive library shared significant similarity with putative OBP genes from other insects. Alignment studies suggested six other ESTs (S146, R1, R3, R13, R80, R84) had OBP-like cysteine spacing patterns, while one (S99) resembled a CSP ( Table 2 ). Using a combination of the SMART IIA primers used in preparing the libraries and primers specific for ESTs S56 and R21 (see Section 2 ), we obtained two nearly full-length cDNAs with sequence data matching that of S56 and R21. The cDNA obtained using the primer specific for S56 was 488 bp long including a 63 bp 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and 8 bp of 3′ untranslated sequence. The resulting 414 bp open reading frame (ORF) coded for a predicted protein of 138 amino acids that we named CfOBP1 (GenBank accession no. DQ232623 ). BLASTP analysis indicated that CfOBP1 was most similar to an antennal binding protein (MsABPX) identified in Manduca sexta ( Fig. 3 ; Robertson et al., 1999 ). The cDNA obtained using a primer specific for R21 was 621 bp long including a 60 bp 5′ UTR and 123 bp of 3′ untranslated sequence. The resulting 435 bp ORF encoded a predicted 145 amino acid protein named CfOBP2 (GenBank accession no. DQ232624 ) that was most similar to a predicted OBP (AgOBP25) identified in the A. gambiae genome ( Fig. 3 ; Xu et al., 2003 ). The putative OBPs from C. floridanum also shared modest similarity to an OBP-like sequence from A. mellifera identified as ASP4 in GenBank. Alignment of CfOBP1 and CfOBP2 with MsABPX, AgOBP25, and ASP4 revealed the conserved positions of six cysteines but few other residues in all of the sequences ( Fig. 3 ).",
              "RT-PCR analysis indicated that CfOBP1 was specifically expressed in soldiers while CfOBP2 was specifically expressed in first instar reproductives ( Fig. 2 ). This again suggested caste-specific functions for these genes. Caste-specific expression of OBPs and CSPs has also been reported in several other social insects ( Danty et al., 1997 ; Kamakouchi et al., 2004 ; Calvello et al., 2005 ; Ozaki et al., 2005 ). Krieger and Ross (2002) found that variants of GP-9, a protein with the conserved cysteine spacing observed in OBPs, correlates with formation of single queen (monogyne) and multiple queen (polygyne) colonies in the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta , while a CSP has been implicated in nest mate recognition by the Japanese harvester ant Camponotus japonicus ( Ozaki et al., 2005 ). Thus, the differentially expressed genes identified here are attractive candidates for additional study given the ability of C. floridanum soldiers to distinguish relatives from non-relatives ( Giron et al., 2004 ; Giron and Strand, 2004 )."

Four ESTs isolated from the reproductive library shared significant similarity with predicted RR-1 genes from D. melanogaster, A. mellifera , and A. gambiae ( Table 2 ). Alignment of the C. floridanum ESTs indicated that R56 and R172 were very similar but not identical to one another while R145 and R161 were more divergent (data not presented). Conceptual translation identified an RR-1 consensus sequence in each of these ESTs except R161. RT-PCR analysis indicated that R145 and R161 were expressed in C. floridanum larvae but not in adults ( Fig. 4 ). However, neither of these transcripts was caste-specific. R145 expression appeared biased toward second instar reproductive larvae while R161 was biased toward first instar reproductives and soldiers ( Fig. 4 )."

              "Scorpion venoms contain toxins that are characterized by six cysteine residues whose spacing is very similar to a family of insect antimicrobial peptides called defensins ( Possani et al., 2000 ; Otvos, 2000 ). Three ESTs (S89, R83, R89) sequenced during the current study were putatively full-length cDNAs that coded for peptides resembling short toxins identified in the scorpions Buthus martensii and Centruroides noxius ( Fig. 5 ). We named these cysteine-rich peptides CfCRP1 (=S89), CfCRP2 (=R83), and CfCRP3 (=R89) (Genbank accession nos. DQ232625–DQ232627 DQ232625 DQ232626 DQ232627 ). Alignments indicated that CfCRP2 and 3 have identical signal peptides and produce mature peptides that consist of 49 and 50 residues, respectively, with 58% similarity to one another. CfCRP1 in contrast produces a predicted 57 amino acid mature peptide that is 32% and 35% similar to CfCRP2 and 3, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that CfCRP1 (=S89) was preferentially expressed in soldiers while CfCRP2 and 3 (=R83 and R89) were preferentially expressed in reproductive larvae ( Fig. 4 ). Whether these products function as toxins or antimicrobial peptides, however, is unknown. Preliminary studies conducted by relative quantitative RT-PCR (rqRT-PCR) indicated that each CfCRP is constitutively expressed and none are upregulated following exposure of larvae to bacteria or fungi (DMD and MRS, unpublished observations). Characterizing tissue-specific expression patterns for these transcripts and conducting detailed bioassays will be essential to elucidating their function."

The largest class of these ESTs encoded predicted ribosomal proteins ( Table 2 ). Notably, 17 of these putative ribosomal genes were identified in the reproductive library while only one was found in the soldier library. This strong bias may be indicative of a caste-specific difference in metabolic activity since reproductive larvae rapidly consume the host after eclosing while soldier larvae feed minimally. Several other ESTs with significant expect values were related to transcriptional regulators, transporters, and metabolic genes ( Table 2 ).",
              "Four ESTs assigned to the miscellaneous category were potentially related to proteins produced in insect salivary glands. S31 and S95 from the soldier library shared significant similarity with a predicted gene from A. gambiae that encodes a major royal jelly protein (MJRP) domain (pfam03022). MJRP domains are characteristic of MJRPs from A. mellifera and the Yellow family of proteins that have functions in a diversity of physiological processes ( Bastock, 1956 ; Inestrosa et al., 1996 ; Han et al., 2002 ; Volf et al., 2002 ). Albert and Klaudiny (2004) hypothesized that MJRPs expressed in the hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees potentially evolved from ancestral Yellow family proteins expressed in insect saliva. R85 is a putatively full-length cDNA that encodes a predicted protein 44% identical to the Saliva protein from D. melanogaster . Lastly, one EST (S162) encoded a predicted protein 48% identical to a venom Antigen 5 precursor protein found in the hornet Dolichovespula maculata ( Fang et al., 1988 ). The function of Antigen 5-related proteins is unknown but homologs have been identified in the salivary glands of numerous other insects ( Charlab et al., 1999 , Valenzuela et al., 2002 , Campbell et al., 2005 ). RT-PCR analysis confirmed that S95 and S162 were preferentially expressed in soldiers ( Fig. 4 ). Weak expression of S162 was also detected in first instar reproductives and, somewhat surprisingly, S95 expression was detected in adults. Reciprocally, R85 was most strongly expressed in first instar reproductives ( Fig. 4 ). Morphological studies conducted on several polyembryonic encyrtids including C. floridanum suggest that soldier and reproductive larvae possess salivary glands ( Silvestri, 1937 ; Ivanova-Kasas, 1972 ). The function of these glands, however, is unknown."

              "Broadening the suite of identified genes is essential to understanding caste formation and function in C. floridanum . In this study, we opted to pursue an SSH strategy as a first step to identifying differentially expressed genes with potential caste-specific functions. Given that we constructed our subtracted libraries using RNA from fully developed larvae, the genes we identified are most likely involved in physiological processes and functions that differ between soldiers and reproductive larva rather than in the process of caste determination that occurs during embryonic development. Evidence that our SSH strategy was successful includes the large number of unique clones that we identified in both libraries. Our discussion of the results focused primarily on the genes that shared significant similarity with known genes from other organisms. However, the majority of unique ESTs we identified appear unrelated to any known genes. Since our RT-PCR studies strongly support the conclusion that the libraries we produced were enriched for transcripts preferentially or specifically expressed in soldiers or reproductive larvae, many additional genes with potentially novel functions are also likely expressed in caste-specific patterns.",
              "Studies to identify differentially expressed genes in castes from other social insects have predominantly identified enzymes and other proteins with metabolic functions ( Evans and Wheeler, 1999, 2000 ; Hepperle and Hartfelder, 2001 ; Robinson, 2002 ; Scharf et al., 2003 ; Calvello et al., 2005 ; Pereboom et al., 2005 ). Thus, our finding that soldiers and reproductive larvae differentially express several enzymes, proteinase inhibitors and ribosomal proteins was not surprising. More unique was our finding of several differentially expressed OBP-like and putative toxin-encoding genes. As previously discussed, OBPs are attractive candidates in kin recognition which is especially important in the function of soldiers. The putative toxin-like and SP genes we identified could also play important roles in the ability of soldiers to kill competitors or in immune defense against potential pathogens. Studies currently in progress focus on testing these ideas."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction A key characteristic of advanced social insects is the evolution of behaviorally and often morphologically specialized castes. One caste invariably consists of individuals that reproduce while others consist of individuals that are functionally sterile and perform helper tasks. Caste determination is usually regulated by environmental stimuli such as diet or temperature rather than genotype ( Kumaran, 1983 ; Wheeler, 1986 ; Julian et al., 2002 ; Ashe and Oldroyd, 2002 ; Cahan and Keller, 2003 ). Perception of these environmental cues in turn stimulates changes in gene expression and physiological processes that result in development into one caste or another. Precisely how these changes in gene expression regulate caste fate or the functions castes subsequently perform is poorly understood ( Evans and Wheeler, 2001 ; Whitfield et al., 2003 ). Among the most unusual caste-forming insects are polyembryonic wasps in the family Encyrtidae ( Strand and Grbic, 1997 ; Grbic, 2000 ; Strand, 2003 ). These insects are obligate parasitoids whose eggs give rise to multiple, genetically identical offspring. The most studied polyembryonic wasp is Copidosoma floridanum . This parasitoid oviposits into the egg stage of the moth Trichoplusia ni . After parasitism the host egg hatches and the caterpillar develops to its final (fifth) instar. During this period, the wasp egg undergoes a clonal phase of development that results in production of as many as 3000 embryos that form an assemblage called a polymorula. Up to 24% of these embryos develop during the host's first–fourth instars into obligately sterile soldier larvae. Soldier larvae have a characteristically serpentine body form, feed minimally on the host and never molt ( Fig. 1 ). However, soldiers readily defend their clonal siblings by attacking inter- and intraspecific parasitoid competitors that attempt to utilize the host ( Grbic et al., 1992 ; Harvey et al., 2000 ; Giron et al., 2004 ). The remaining embryos in the polymorula develop into reproductive larvae during the host's fifth instar. Reproductive larvae have a more rounded morphology than soldiers and undergo two instars in the course of host consumption ( Fig. 1 ). Reproductive larvae also differ from soldiers in that they are completely non-aggressive toward competitors. Following consumption of the host, reproductive larvae pupate inside the remnant host cuticle and subsequently emerge as adult wasps. Soldier larvae in contrast always die after their reproductive siblings consume the host. Early workers were unclear as to how caste formation could be regulated in polyembryonic wasps because all of the embryos in a brood are genetically identical, develop in close proximity to one another in a polymorula, and are exposed to identical environmental conditions in the host ( Patterson, 1921 ; Silvestri, 1937 ; Ivanova-Kasas, 1972 ; Cruz, 1981 ). More recent studies have shown that caste fate in C. floridanum is mediated by a developmental asymmetry that results in differential allocation of germ cells to embryos ( Donnell et al., 2004 ; Zhurov et al., 2004 ). Similar to other phylogenetically advanced insects, primordial germ cells (PGCs) in C. floridanum are specified early in embryogenesis via inheritance of maternal determinants ( Extavour and Akam, 2003 ; Extavour, 2004 ). Unlike other insects, however, PGCs in C. floridanum proliferate substantially during the clonal phase of development and are asymmetrically parceled to embryos. Embryos that inherit germ cells develop into reproductive larvae while embryos that do not develop into soldiers ( Donnell et al., 2004 ; Zhurov et al., 2004 ). The proportion of embryos that inherit germ cells is also responsive to changes in environmental conditions. This phenotypic plasticity allows C. floridanum to adaptively shift ratios of investment in soldier and reproductive larvae as a function of the level of risk posed by competitors ( Harvey et al., 2000 ). How the presence or absence of germ cells causes caste-specific differences in morphology, physiology, and behavior is unknown. As in other caste-forming insects, however, these differences must be due in part to differential gene expression between embryos that develop into soldiers and reproductives. Differential gene expression likely persists once soldier and reproductive larvae eclose given their distinctly different functional activities. Most studies on caste-specific patterns in gene expression have focused on advanced social insects like the honeybee ( Evans and Wheeler, 1999, 2000 ; Hepperle and Hartfelder, 2001 ; Robinson, 2002 ; Calvello et al., 2005 ), termites ( Miura et al., 1999 ; Scharf et al., 2003 ) and ants ( Abouheif and Wray, 2002 ; Tian et al., 2004 ). More limited data have also been gathered for the bumblebee ( Pereboom et al., 2005 ) and caste-forming aphids ( Kutsukake et al., 2004 ). In this study, we focused on identifying differentially expressed genes in the reproductive and soldier larvae of C. floridanum by using a bi-directional suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach. Our screen identified more than 200 novel sequences of which 94 showed significant similarity to known genes. Several of these sequences were classified into categories of potential significance to the functions of soldier and reproductive larvae. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Insect rearing C. floridanum and its host, T. ni , were reared at 27 °C, 70% RH and a 16 h L: 8 h D photoperiod as described by Baehrecke and colleagues (1993) . Host larvae were staged as described by Strand (1989) . 2.2 cDNA preparation and subtractive hybridization To isolate genes differentially expressed in the two larval castes, we utilized the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) procedure described by Diatchenko et al. (1996) . SSH involves hybridization of an experimental (tester) cDNA population to an excess of a reference (driver) cDNA population followed by PCR amplification and cloning of the unhybridized, and thus novel or rare, tester cDNA sequences. We isolated total RNA from C. floridanum soldier and reproductive larvae using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by further purification using a High Prime kit (Roche). mRNA was then isolated using Oligotex beads (Qiagen) and quantified using RiboGreen reagent (Molecular Probes) and a Fluostar Galaxy platereader (BMG). A SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) was used to produce 2 μg of tester and driver cDNA for each subtraction using 250 ng of mRNA from each caste as template. Following digestion of cDNA pools with Rsa I a PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) was used for adaptor ligation and subtraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Products resulting from the SSH procedure were amplified on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermocycler using Advantage2 Polymerase reagents (BD Bioscience). 2.3 EST sequencing and cloning of full-length cDNAs The PCR products resulting from the subtractions were cloned into pCRII-TOPO or pCR4-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) and the resulting clones transformed into TOP 10 competent cells (Invitrogen). The transformants were plated on ampicillin-containing LB agar plates with (pCRII-TOPO) or without (pCR4-TOPO) XGAL and grown overnight at 37 °C. Selected white colonies were grown in 2 mL LB-ampicillin media overnight at 37 °C. The plasmid DNA was then harvested using a FastPlasmid kit (Eppendorf). Sequencing reactions were run using ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing reagents. Samples were then sequenced by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI). All sequences were used to query the GenBank/EMBL database with the BLASTX program ( Altschul et al., 1997 ) in June 2005. Conceptual translations of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with significant similarity to known genes were used to search for conserved domains using the CD-Search program ( Marchler-Bauer and Bryant, 2004 ) in the course of BLASTP searches ( Altschul et al., 1997 ). To obtain full-length cDNAs for ESTs of interest, we used the original cDNA pools generated for library construction as template in combination with BD SMART IIA and gene-specific primers to amplify 3′ and 5′ extensions of ESTs by PCR. The fragments from these reactions were visualized on EtBr-stained agarose gels, isolated using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and then subcloned into a pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Inserts were sequenced as described above. Putatively full-length cDNAs were then assembled from the overlapping sequences using the Seqman program (DNASTAR, Inc.). Conceptual translations of sequences of interest were aligned to putative homologs using the MegAlign Program (DNASTAR, Inc.). Small peptide sequences were aligned by eye using conserved cysteine residues to anchor the alignments. Signal peptides were predicted using the SignalP 3.0 program of Bendtsen and colleagues (2004) . Non-redundant cDNA sequences were submitted to GenBank (see Section 3 ). 2.4 Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) We used RT-PCR to determine whether genes corresponding to certain ESTs were expressed in soldier larvae, first and second instar reproductive larvae, or adult wasps. Briefly, 350 ng of total RNA from each caste or stage was isolated and used for reverse transcription. The resulting cDNA was used as template with gene-specific primers for 20 cycles under the following PCR conditions: 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s. Amplification of an 18S ribosomal gene fragment was used as an endogenous control. C. floridanum larvae are easily collected from hosts without the risk of contamination from host tissues. Nonetheless, to ensure that the genes discussed in the study were from C. floridanum , we also conducted PCR reactions using DNA or reverse transcribed RNA from the host, T. ni , as template. These control experiments never produced a PCR product (data not presented). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Construction and sequencing of SSH libraries To identify genes differentially expressed in soldier and reproductive larvae, we performed bi-directional SSHs using cDNA pools from each caste. As outlined by Diatchenko and colleagues (1996) , this procedure incorporates a cDNA normalization step with suppression PCR to selectively amplify rare and novel transcripts in the population of interest. Each of the resulting soldier and reproductive SSH libraries produced approximately 4000 colonies of which approximately 40% were white. The average insert size for twenty clones randomly selected from each library was 520 bp. We then selected an additional 180 clones from each library such that a total of 400 clones were sequenced. A summary of the results is presented in Table 1 . A total of 365 clones produced usable sequence data of which 230 contained novel ESTs. These ESTs were submitted to GenBank and assigned the accessions nos. DV181803 – DV182032 . The remaining 135 clones contained duplicate sequences. Only 30 duplicate sequences were encountered in the first 200 clones we sequenced (100 soldier and 100 reproductive), whereas 105 duplicates were obtained in the last 200 clones. This indicated that each subtraction library contained novel clones above the 200 we sequenced but that the rate at which we recovered novel clones had rapidly declined by the time random sequencing was stopped. We compared the novel ESTs from the soldier and reproductive libraries with the GenBank/EMBL database using the BLASTX program. Matches having an expect ( E ) value ⩽10 −4 were classified as significant. This analysis identified 94 ESTs with significant similarity to characterized genes, 11 ESTs with similarity to uncharacterized genes and 125 ESTs (54%) with no similarity to known genes ( Table 1 ). After inspection of these data, we subdivided the ESTs with significant BLASTX scores into six categories: enzymes, proteinase inhibitors, odorant-binding and chemosensory proteins, cuticular proteins, cysteine-rich peptides, and miscellaneous. A complete list of identified transcripts is presented in Table 2 . ESTs in each category are described in more detail below along with expression data for genes corresponding to ESTs used to determine if the SSH libraries were enriched for differentially expressed transcripts. 3.2 Enzymes Principal among the products of the two subtractions were ESTs with significant similarity to a number of enzyme-encoding genes. The most abundant class of enzymes coded for were serine proteinases. ESTs related to other functional classes of enzymes were also identified in both the soldier and reproductive libraries. 3.2.1 Serine proteinases (SPs) SPs are characterized by a signature domain that includes a catalytic triad comprised of an invariant histidine, aspartic acid, and serine residue. SPs are functionally diverse with especially important roles in digestion, immunity, and development ( Terra and Ferreira, 1994 ; Misra et al., 1998 ; Muharsini et al., 2000 ; Jiang and Kanost, 2000 ; Theopold et al., 2004 ). Organisms also commonly encode genes with SP signature domains that lack one or more of the invariant residues in the catalytic triad. These genes are referred to as SP homologs (SPHs) ( Ross et al., 2003 ). We identified 21 ESTs with trypsin-like serine proteinase domains (conserved domain cd00190; see Table 2 ), but sequence data was often insufficient to determine whether a given EST had an intact catalytic triad. The vast majority (81%) of these ESTs were isolated from the soldier library. Five ESTs from the soldier library (S7, S32, S48, S49, S191) were most similar to two trypsin-like SP genes from Drosophila melanogaster ( Table 2 ). Alignments indicated that these ESTs differed from one another suggesting that C. floridanum encodes several closely related trypsin-like SPs (data not presented). Two other soldier ESTs (S19 and S34) were most similar to genes coding for SPs with immune-related functions in mammals, while a third (S103) was most similar to an SP gene from the fly Sarcophaga peregrina that has been implicated in autolysis of the midgut during metamorphosis ( Nakajima et al., 1997 ; Tsuji et al., 1998 ) ( Table 2 ). The putative SP partially encoded by S103, however, is unlikely to have a similar function given that soldier larvae never molt. Only four ESTs with similarity to SP/SPH genes were identified from the reproductive library. R107 and R162 had modest but significant similarity to digestive trypsin and chymotrypsin genes, while R2 and R36 shared more significant similarity to a gene coding for a predicted prophenoloxidase-activating factor (PAF) from the honeybee Apis mellifera ( Table 2 ). Alignment of R2 and R36 revealed that these ESTs partially overlapped to form a contiguous sequence. Conceptual translation of this sequence revealed coding regions for the histidine and aspartic acid residues of a catalytic triad but the essential serine was replaced by a glycine indicating that R2 and R36 code for an SPH. PAFs regulate activation of prophenoloxidase (proPO) ( Ashida and Brey, 1998 ; Jiang and Kanost, 2000 ) and certain PAF-like SPHs facilitate this process ( Yu et al., 2003 ). Recently, however, a PAF-like SPH was identified from the venom gland of the endoparasitic wasp Cotesia rubecula that significantly reduced the proteolysis of proPO by its host ( Asgari et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2004 ). Alignments indicate that the C. rubecula and C. floridanum SPHs share significant sequence similarity as well as the glycine for serine replacement in the catalytic triad (data not presented). Whether or not the C. floridanum SPH interacts with the host proPO cascade is currently under investigation. We selected six of the SP/SPH ESTs for RT-PCR analysis (S4, S19, S32, S103, R2, R162) to determine whether they were differentially expressed in soldier and reproductive larvae. Our results indicated that each EST from the soldier library was either specifically or preferentially expressed in soldiers ( Fig. 2 ). Reciprocally, R2 and R162 were expressed in first and second instar reproductive larvae but not in soldiers. We also detected expression of R2 but not R162 in adult wasps. These results indicated that each subtracted library was enriched for differentially expressed SPs or SPHs. They also suggest that C. floridanum encodes SP or SPH genes with caste-specific functions. At this time we can only speculate as to what those functions might be although two possibilities are especially attractive. As previously noted, soldier larvae feed minimally on the host but readily attack and kill competitors ( Giron et al., 2004 ). Thus, soldiers may introduce SPs or other proteinases into competitors during combat. An example of this was recently found for a digestive proteinase produced by soldiers of the social aphid Tuberaphis styraci ( Kutsukake et al., 2004 ). Hosts parasitized by C. floridanum exhibit very few alterations in development until the reproductive larvae molt to the second instar at which time host tissues rapidly degenerate ( Baehrecke et al., 1993 ; Strand and Grbic, 1997 ). The rapid breakdown of host tissues at this time circumstantially suggests that second instar reproductives secrete digestive enzymes like trypsins and chymotrypsins into the host to facilitate its consumption. Extraoral digestion of host tissues has been observed in other endoparasitic wasps ( Quicke, 1997 , for review). 3.2.2 Other enzymes Eleven of the clones we sequenced were similar to genes encoding other types of enzymes ( Table 2 ). Two of these ESTs (S9 and S145) were from the soldier library. S9 partially encoded a protein with a putative signal peptide, suggestive of secretion, and significant similarity to a carboxylesterase from A. mellifera . S145 encoded a transglutaminase core domain (Protein family code pfam01841) and shared significant similarity with a hypothetical transglutaminase gene identified in the genome of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae . The nine ESTs from the reproductive larva library included R109 and R148 that contain coding regions for a lipase (cd00741) and glycosyl hydrolase (pfam00232) domain, respectively. These features suggest the corresponding genes have digestive functions. The seven remaining ESTs were related to genes that coded for other enzymes including translocases and a glutathione S-transferase ( Table 2 ). RT-PCR analysis indicated that S9 was specifically expressed in soldiers while R109 was restricted to expression in first instar reproductives ( Fig. 2 ). 3.3 Proteinase inhibitors A diversity of proteins function as inhibitors of proteinases. Among these is the class of serine proteinase inhibitors known as serpins ( Tong and Kanost, 2005 ). Similarity searches in GenBank indicated that four ESTs from the soldier library (S35, S122, S143, S177) coded for serpin domains (cd00172) ( Table 2 ). In addition, an EST from the soldier library (S147) exhibited significant similarity to a gene from A. mellifera coding for a putative kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor while the only reproductive EST (R28) found to contain sequence similarity to proteinase inhibitors also encoded a kazal domain ( Table 2 ). Kazal domains (cd00104) have been identified in a range of proteinase inhibitors including anti-thrombins. Contrary to expectation, S143 was expressed in both soldiers and second instar reproductives indicating that this EST is not a soldier-specific gene product ( Fig. 2 ). Expression of R28, however, was caste-specific with expression restricted to second instar reproductives ( Fig. 2 ). Sequence analysis further indicated that R28 contained both the 5′ SMART adaptor sequence and a polyA tract suggesting this EST was a full-length cDNA. The highest similarity matches to R28 were to two insect genes: (1) a putative proteinase inhibitor identified from larval stage Lonomia obliqua (Lepidoptera) which induce hemorrhagic responses when touched ( Kelen et al., 1996 ), and (2) a thiol proteinase inhibitor expressed in the midgut of the biting midge Culicoides sonorensis ( Campbell et al., 2005 ). 3.4 Odorant-binding and chemosensory proteins We also identified a large number of ESTs from the subtracted soldier and reproductive libraries related to odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) ( Table 2 ). OBPs are distinguished by the spacing of six cysteine residues that form three internal disulfide bridges ( Vogt et al., 1991 ; Angeli et al., 1999 ). Sequence conservation among OBP family members outside of these conserved cysteines is poor. CSPs are more conserved in their amino acid sequences than OBPs and contain four cysteine residues that form two internal disulfide bridges ( Scaloni et al., 1999 ; Calvello et al., 2003 ). OBPs and CSPs are both thought to facilitate chemical communication by binding hydrophobic molecules in the lymph of chemosensory structures and transporting them to transmembrane receptors on the surface of dendrites ( Vogt et al., 1985 ; Pelosi et al., 2005 ). However, expression of OBPs and CSPs has also been detected in a number of non-sensory tissues suggesting some of these proteins may have transport functions unrelated to chemoreception ( Pelosi et al., 2005 ). In this study, one EST from the soldier library (S56) and another (R21) from the reproductive library shared significant similarity with putative OBP genes from other insects. Alignment studies suggested six other ESTs (S146, R1, R3, R13, R80, R84) had OBP-like cysteine spacing patterns, while one (S99) resembled a CSP ( Table 2 ). Using a combination of the SMART IIA primers used in preparing the libraries and primers specific for ESTs S56 and R21 (see Section 2 ), we obtained two nearly full-length cDNAs with sequence data matching that of S56 and R21. The cDNA obtained using the primer specific for S56 was 488 bp long including a 63 bp 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and 8 bp of 3′ untranslated sequence. The resulting 414 bp open reading frame (ORF) coded for a predicted protein of 138 amino acids that we named CfOBP1 (GenBank accession no. DQ232623 ). BLASTP analysis indicated that CfOBP1 was most similar to an antennal binding protein (MsABPX) identified in Manduca sexta ( Fig. 3 ; Robertson et al., 1999 ). The cDNA obtained using a primer specific for R21 was 621 bp long including a 60 bp 5′ UTR and 123 bp of 3′ untranslated sequence. The resulting 435 bp ORF encoded a predicted 145 amino acid protein named CfOBP2 (GenBank accession no. DQ232624 ) that was most similar to a predicted OBP (AgOBP25) identified in the A. gambiae genome ( Fig. 3 ; Xu et al., 2003 ). The putative OBPs from C. floridanum also shared modest similarity to an OBP-like sequence from A. mellifera identified as ASP4 in GenBank. Alignment of CfOBP1 and CfOBP2 with MsABPX, AgOBP25, and ASP4 revealed the conserved positions of six cysteines but few other residues in all of the sequences ( Fig. 3 ). RT-PCR analysis indicated that CfOBP1 was specifically expressed in soldiers while CfOBP2 was specifically expressed in first instar reproductives ( Fig. 2 ). This again suggested caste-specific functions for these genes. Caste-specific expression of OBPs and CSPs has also been reported in several other social insects ( Danty et al., 1997 ; Kamakouchi et al., 2004 ; Calvello et al., 2005 ; Ozaki et al., 2005 ). Krieger and Ross (2002) found that variants of GP-9, a protein with the conserved cysteine spacing observed in OBPs, correlates with formation of single queen (monogyne) and multiple queen (polygyne) colonies in the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta , while a CSP has been implicated in nest mate recognition by the Japanese harvester ant Camponotus japonicus ( Ozaki et al., 2005 ). Thus, the differentially expressed genes identified here are attractive candidates for additional study given the ability of C. floridanum soldiers to distinguish relatives from non-relatives ( Giron et al., 2004 ; Giron and Strand, 2004 ). 3.5 Cuticular proteins Insects encode a large number of cuticular protein genes that are divided into several classes ( Willis et al., 2005 ). The RR-1 class of cuticular proteins is found primarily in the soft, flexible cuticle of larvae ( Rebers and Riddiford, 1988 ; Anderson, 1998 ). RR-1 proteins are also characterized by the presence of a consensus sequence GxFxYxxPDGxxxxVxYxAD-ENGYQPxGAHLP that is involved in binding to chitin ( Rebers and Willis, 2001 ; Willis et al., 2005 ). Four ESTs isolated from the reproductive library shared significant similarity with predicted RR-1 genes from D. melanogaster, A. mellifera , and A. gambiae ( Table 2 ). Alignment of the C. floridanum ESTs indicated that R56 and R172 were very similar but not identical to one another while R145 and R161 were more divergent (data not presented). Conceptual translation identified an RR-1 consensus sequence in each of these ESTs except R161. RT-PCR analysis indicated that R145 and R161 were expressed in C. floridanum larvae but not in adults ( Fig. 4 ). However, neither of these transcripts was caste-specific. R145 expression appeared biased toward second instar reproductive larvae while R161 was biased toward first instar reproductives and soldiers ( Fig. 4 ). 3.6 Cysteine-rich peptides Scorpion venoms contain toxins that are characterized by six cysteine residues whose spacing is very similar to a family of insect antimicrobial peptides called defensins ( Possani et al., 2000 ; Otvos, 2000 ). Three ESTs (S89, R83, R89) sequenced during the current study were putatively full-length cDNAs that coded for peptides resembling short toxins identified in the scorpions Buthus martensii and Centruroides noxius ( Fig. 5 ). We named these cysteine-rich peptides CfCRP1 (=S89), CfCRP2 (=R83), and CfCRP3 (=R89) (Genbank accession nos. DQ232625–DQ232627 DQ232625 DQ232626 DQ232627 ). Alignments indicated that CfCRP2 and 3 have identical signal peptides and produce mature peptides that consist of 49 and 50 residues, respectively, with 58% similarity to one another. CfCRP1 in contrast produces a predicted 57 amino acid mature peptide that is 32% and 35% similar to CfCRP2 and 3, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicated that CfCRP1 (=S89) was preferentially expressed in soldiers while CfCRP2 and 3 (=R83 and R89) were preferentially expressed in reproductive larvae ( Fig. 4 ). Whether these products function as toxins or antimicrobial peptides, however, is unknown. Preliminary studies conducted by relative quantitative RT-PCR (rqRT-PCR) indicated that each CfCRP is constitutively expressed and none are upregulated following exposure of larvae to bacteria or fungi (DMD and MRS, unpublished observations). Characterizing tissue-specific expression patterns for these transcripts and conducting detailed bioassays will be essential to elucidating their function. 3.7 Miscellaneous proteins Individual ESTs that did not fit into one of the preceding categories or that shared homology with housekeeping genes were assigned to the miscellaneous category. The largest class of these ESTs encoded predicted ribosomal proteins ( Table 2 ). Notably, 17 of these putative ribosomal genes were identified in the reproductive library while only one was found in the soldier library. This strong bias may be indicative of a caste-specific difference in metabolic activity since reproductive larvae rapidly consume the host after eclosing while soldier larvae feed minimally. Several other ESTs with significant expect values were related to transcriptional regulators, transporters, and metabolic genes ( Table 2 ). Four ESTs assigned to the miscellaneous category were potentially related to proteins produced in insect salivary glands. S31 and S95 from the soldier library shared significant similarity with a predicted gene from A. gambiae that encodes a major royal jelly protein (MJRP) domain (pfam03022). MJRP domains are characteristic of MJRPs from A. mellifera and the Yellow family of proteins that have functions in a diversity of physiological processes ( Bastock, 1956 ; Inestrosa et al., 1996 ; Han et al., 2002 ; Volf et al., 2002 ). Albert and Klaudiny (2004) hypothesized that MJRPs expressed in the hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees potentially evolved from ancestral Yellow family proteins expressed in insect saliva. R85 is a putatively full-length cDNA that encodes a predicted protein 44% identical to the Saliva protein from D. melanogaster . Lastly, one EST (S162) encoded a predicted protein 48% identical to a venom Antigen 5 precursor protein found in the hornet Dolichovespula maculata ( Fang et al., 1988 ). The function of Antigen 5-related proteins is unknown but homologs have been identified in the salivary glands of numerous other insects ( Charlab et al., 1999 , Valenzuela et al., 2002 , Campbell et al., 2005 ). RT-PCR analysis confirmed that S95 and S162 were preferentially expressed in soldiers ( Fig. 4 ). Weak expression of S162 was also detected in first instar reproductives and, somewhat surprisingly, S95 expression was detected in adults. Reciprocally, R85 was most strongly expressed in first instar reproductives ( Fig. 4 ). Morphological studies conducted on several polyembryonic encyrtids including C. floridanum suggest that soldier and reproductive larvae possess salivary glands ( Silvestri, 1937 ; Ivanova-Kasas, 1972 ). The function of these glands, however, is unknown. 3.8 Conclusions Broadening the suite of identified genes is essential to understanding caste formation and function in C. floridanum . In this study, we opted to pursue an SSH strategy as a first step to identifying differentially expressed genes with potential caste-specific functions. Given that we constructed our subtracted libraries using RNA from fully developed larvae, the genes we identified are most likely involved in physiological processes and functions that differ between soldiers and reproductive larva rather than in the process of caste determination that occurs during embryonic development. Evidence that our SSH strategy was successful includes the large number of unique clones that we identified in both libraries. Our discussion of the results focused primarily on the genes that shared significant similarity with known genes from other organisms. However, the majority of unique ESTs we identified appear unrelated to any known genes. Since our RT-PCR studies strongly support the conclusion that the libraries we produced were enriched for transcripts preferentially or specifically expressed in soldiers or reproductive larvae, many additional genes with potentially novel functions are also likely expressed in caste-specific patterns. Studies to identify differentially expressed genes in castes from other social insects have predominantly identified enzymes and other proteins with metabolic functions ( Evans and Wheeler, 1999, 2000 ; Hepperle and Hartfelder, 2001 ; Robinson, 2002 ; Scharf et al., 2003 ; Calvello et al., 2005 ; Pereboom et al., 2005 ). Thus, our finding that soldiers and reproductive larvae differentially express several enzymes, proteinase inhibitors and ribosomal proteins was not surprising. More unique was our finding of several differentially expressed OBP-like and putative toxin-encoding genes. As previously discussed, OBPs are attractive candidates in kin recognition which is especially important in the function of soldiers. The putative toxin-like and SP genes we identified could also play important roles in the ability of soldiers to kill competitors or in immune defense against potential pathogens. Studies currently in progress focus on testing these ideas. Acknowledgments We thank J. Johnson, S. Damaraju, and J. Varner for assistance in maintenance of the insect cultures used in the study.
