    "full_text": "Sugarcane ( Saccharum officinarum L.) is one of the main annual crops grown in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. By understanding the taxonomic and functional profiles of root endophytic microbiome, we can develop a new cultivation technique for the sustainable production of this plant. In this work, a representative sample was obtained by mixing the roots collected from five different sugarcane fields in Dak Lak Province, the Central Highlands, in 2021. The genomic DNA of the endophytic bacteria was extracted using the DNeasy Powersoil kit, and the V1–V9 regions of the 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR. Libraries of 16S rRNA gene amplicons were prepared using the Swift amplicon 16S plus ITS panel kit. Finally, the Illumina MiSeq platform was used to sequence the 16S rRNA gene amplicons library. The raw data of the endophytic microbiome were uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with Bioproject PRJNA923851 and can be retrieved at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=%20PRJNA923851 . The obtained data provide basic information on the root endophytic microbiome of sugarcane cultivated in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The data can also be useful for further developing a new technique for sustainable sugarcane production based on indigenous microorganisms. This work is the first report on the endophytic microbiome of sugarcane cultivated in this region."

Taxonomic analysis showed that only two phyla were identified from the root sample. Among them, the phylum Proteobacteria (81.7%) was found to be the most abundant, while Firmicutes was 18.3%. There were three classes identified from the two phyla. Gammaproteobacteria accounted for 59.6% of the classes, Alphaproteobacteria took 22.1%, and Bacilli were 18.3%. Five bacterial orders were detected from the classes, including Bacillales, Thermoactinomycetales, Rhizobiales, Enterobacterales, and Xanthomonadales. Among them, Enterobacterales was shown to be the most predominant (57.7%), followed by Rhizobiales (22.1%). Moreover, six families were detected: Bacillaceae, Thermoactinomycetaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Erwiniaceae, and Rhodanobacteraceae. Of the families, Erwiniaceae (25.9%) was the most abundant, followed by Rhizobiaceae (22.1%). Finally, seven out of nine genera were assigned, in which genus Erwinia was the most predominant, with 25.9% ( Fig. 1 ).

To develop new cultivation techniques for sustainable production of the main crops in this region, rhizospheric and endophytic microbiome data of some perennial industrial crops, coffee and black pepper, have been demonstrated [2–4] . However, an endophytic microbiome dataset of the sugarcane is unknown. This work aimed to establish a dataset on taxonomic and functional profiles of root endophytic prokaryotes of the sugarcane cultivated in the Central Highlands, Vietnam, using 16S rRNA metagenomics.
