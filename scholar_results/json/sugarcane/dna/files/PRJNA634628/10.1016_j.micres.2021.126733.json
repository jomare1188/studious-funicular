    "full_text": "Since sugarcane is a ratoon crop, genome analysis of plant growth-promoting bacteria that exist in its soil rhizosphere, can provide opportunity to better understand their characteristics and use of such bacteria in turn, may especially improve perennial crop productivity. In the present study, genome of two bacterial strains, one each of B. megaterium (BM89) and B. subtilis (BS87), isolated and reported earlier (Chandra et al., 2018), were sequenced and characterized. Though both strains have demonstrated plant growth promoting properties and enhanced in-vitro plant growth responses, functional annotation and analysis of genes indicated superiority of BS87 as it possessed more plant growth promotion attributable genes over BM89. Apart from some common genes, trehalose metabolism, glycine betaine production, peroxidases, super oxide dismutase, cold shock proteins and phenazine production associated genes were selectively identified in BS87 genome indicating better plant growth performances and survival potential under harsh environmental conditions. Genes for chitinase, d -cysteine desulfhydrase and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as found in BM89, propose its selective utilization in defense and bio-control measures. Concomitant with better settlings’ growth, scanning electron micrographs indicated these isolated and characterized bacteria exhibiting healthy colonization within root of sugarcane crop. Kegg pathways’ assignment also revealed added pathways namely carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism attached to B. subtilis strain BS87, a preferable candidate for bio-fertilizer and its utilization to promote growth of both plant and ratoon crops of sugarcane usually experiencing harsh environmental conditions."

          "Sugarcane is an important industrial crop grown for sugar, biofuel and many other by-products ( Solomon, 2016 ). Climate change has necessitated the employment of green energy and sugarcane perfectly fits in system providing bulk raw material in the form of bagasse and juice for the production of bio-ethanol. In India, >5 mha area is under this crop, about equally distributed in tropical and sub-tropical part of the country. In view of increased demand of green energy internationally, productivity of cane needs to be enhanced worldwide without involving any increase in input namely water, fertilizers and pesticides ( Solomon et al., 2019 ). Moreover, recent change in government policy to utilize sugarcane juice directly to make bio-ethanol, has led to a sudden increase in demand of this crop in India too. In recent past, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been found to be a potent bio-stimulant/ bio-fertilizer having the ability to improve growth by maneuvering soil dynamics and thus providing conducive environment for crop growth ( Tiwari et al., 2016 ; Nascimento et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). In general, such bacteria modulate plant growth promoting plant growth substances in the plant, checking growth and spread of harmful organisms and enhancing uptake and availability of minerals and nutrients; thus constituting a viable alternative to the rampant use of chemicals in agriculture ( Lalande et al., 1989 ; Sessitsch et al., 2018 ). Colonization of such bacteria with the plant rhizosphere has been well documented ( Chin et al., 2000 ).",
          "Since sugarcane is a C 4 ratoon crop, its root stay in soil usually more than a year and therefore different kinds of microbes experience favorable conditions to multiply and prosper. Several bacteria have been isolated and characterized from surface sterilized root and largely reported as nitrogen fixing endophytes ( Döbereiner, 1992 ; Baldani and Baldani, 2005 ) resulting in up to 35 % increment in production ( Boddey et al., 2003 ). In view of the potential application of such bacteria isolated from native environment (rhizopshere) of the crop to be used as bio-fertilizer, the dominant native bacteria needs to be analyzed for better understanding about molecular mechanism of plant growth promotion as well as bio-controls and eventually their utilization to promote and protect plant growth and sustainability. As such, the identification and characterization of genes and regulatory sequences responsible for the beneficial activity of such bacteria are important to widen their applicability. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has greatly facilitated whole genome sequencing of bacteria and other organism ( Schuster, 2008 ; Subramaniam et al., 2020 ) and data generated have helped in better understanding of molecular genetics of bacterial species isolated from crops, soils and herbal vermicompost ( Matilla et al., 2011 ; Mathimaran et al., 2012 ; Subramaniam et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ).",
          "Though selective information about sugarcane rhizospheres viz., how rhizospheric changes impede crop growth and further, how its improvement through bio-agents amended farm yard manure, is available ( Shukla et al., 2008 ; Singh et al., 2013a ). However, the extensive study especially based on whole genome sequence of PGPR isolated from sugarcane rhizospheres and their impact on vivacity of sugarcane rhizosphere is lacking. In our previous work on sugarcane soil rhizosphere ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), among many bacterial isolates, Bacillus strains exhibiting potential role in plant growth promotion have been identified. Dominance of bacteria especially Bacillus spp. has been seen in soils and constitutes major members of the microbiome of many plant hosts worldwide ( Mendes et al., 2013 ) and most of these have been reported as PGPR ( Trivedi and Pandey, 2008 ; Esringü et al., 2014 ; Chandra et al., 2018 ). Further, strains of this species have been reported to colonize well with soils and plant tissues and produce different sets of bioactive compounds that stimulate plant growth and antiphytopathogen activities ( Yu et al., 2002 ). Recently, a comprehensive genome analysis of a stress resistant B. megaterium strain (STB1) has revealed rich genetic elements involved in multiple stress resistance, xenobiotic degradation, pathogen antagonistic activities and other traits related to soil and rhizosphere colonization ( Nascimento et al., 2020 ). In India, sugarcane ratoon crops are not much preferred owing to reduced yield in consecutive years of crop period ( Suman et al., 2005 ; Singh et al., 2013b ). In order to address such issues and to improve overall crop productivity, rhizosphere of sugarcane has been analyzed and therefore present study is aimed to have in-depth genomic insight into one strain each of B. subtilis (BS87) and B. megaterium (BM89), employing next generation sequencing so as to generate PGPRs associated characteristics to facilitate further study and provide an economically safe nutrient management strategy targeting them as potent bio-fertilizers."

              "Of the many bacterial isolates isolated from sugarcane rhizosphere soils and further based on biochemical test and 16S rRNA gene sequences, two isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium ( Chandra et al., 2018 ). These two isolates were submitted to ICAR-National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganism (NBAIM), India and were accessioned as NAIMCC-B-02187 and NAIMCC-B-02189 respectively, indicating their uniqueness. At the perusal of Tables 1 and 2 , it is summarized that both B. subtilis (hereafter, BS87) and B. megaterium (hereafter, BM89) isolates were distinct in their biochemical attributes. In the 35 biochemical tests performed, both of them showed 11 positive reactions and only five tests were common. When plant growth promotional attributes namely phosphate, zinc solubilization, ACC deaminase activity and production of siderophore, IAA and ammonia were compared, BS87 showed better activities than those of BM89 ( Table 2 ). Both the isolates possessed rod shape morphology and were positive for Gram’s staining and endospore producing. The pH tolerance for these two bacteria ranged from 5 to 8, indicating possibility of much more diversity among the strains of the two species as they showed prolific growth in acidic environment. Earlier reports have indicated pH as the best predictor of soil bacterial diversity and richness, with the lower levels of bacterial diversity and richness observed in acid soils ( Fierer and Jackson, 2006 ). Bacteria isolated from arecanut rhizosphere have shown tolerance to low pH and possessed plant growth promoting attributes ( Gupta et al., 2014 ). In general, sugarcane ratoon rhizosphere soil tends to become acidic (pH < 5.0) in nature ( Singh et al., 2007 ), thus these two bacterial strains would survive better under such condition and induce better growth of the crop."

              "A total of 27,552,484 processed reads for BM89 and 32,478,520 for BS87 were obtained when sequencing of the genome of these two bacterial strains was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform. The sequences were trimmed and those with Phread score of > 30 were finally filtered at 28.57 and 30.16 % respectively. The average read length for both BM89 and BS87 was 150bp whereas GC content was 40 % and 45 % respectively. Genome assembly as presented in Table 3 , BM89 genome was finally assembled in 3 contigs with a total length of 3,870,818 bp (N50 of 3,720,580) and BS87 into one contig with a total length of 3,296,945 bp (N50 of 3,296,945). The estimated genome size based on the sequence data was 3.9 Mb for B. megaterium BM89 and 3.3 Mb for B. subtilis BS87. Phylogenetic analysis which is derived using 31 conserved housekeeping protein-coding genes ( Wu and Scott, 2012 ), confirmed both bacteria belong to Bacillaceae family. Genome sizes of the members of this family have been reported to range from 2.8 to 5.8 Mb ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ; Sharma and Satyanarayana, 2013 ), and the two bacteria sequenced in the present study fall well within this range.",
              "Augustus tool which uses Hidden Markov model predicted 4693 and 3372 protein coding genes in BM89 and BS87 genome respectively. Sharma and Satyanarayana (2013) have predicted 5124 and 4100 genes for these two species respectively. Konstantinidis and Tiedje (2004) reported a robust correlation between the genome size and the numbers of genes it encodes. Sharma and Satyanarayana (2013) analyzed complete genome sequences of the member of the Bacillaceae and the average genome size reported was 4.3 Mb and an average of 4364 protein coding gene sequences. Both of these values were found to be well within the range we reported for two different species of Bacillus in the present study. However, when raw data was analyzed through Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (v 2.0) (RAST), only 2720 and 3675 protein coding genes for BM89 and BS87 respectively were observed (Supplementary Table S1, S2). Number of RNA genes from these two bacteria was 50 whereas repeat regions observed were 20 and 17 respectively. Since RAST is an annotation server for microbial genomes, built upon the framework provided by the SEED system, less number of these genes is possible. Also, RAST server did not consider retaining any protein-encoding gene that significantly overlaps any RNA (tRNA, rRNA) genes, ultimately causes smaller RNA genes visualization ( Aziz et al., 2008 ).",
              "The predicted protein coding genes when compared with non-redundant (nr) NCBI database (BLASTX), >95 % predicted non-coding genes possessed homologous protein sequence in NCBI nr protein database ( Fig. 1 ). Among these, 90 % genes showed high confidence match (E-value < = 1.0e −50 ) ( Fig. 1 a). In case of BM89, 58 % genes had identity of at least 80 % with a putative homolog while in case of BS87, 74 % had identity of at least 80 % ( Fig. 1 b). In both the cases, >30 % had identity of 100 % with a putative homolog. All protein-coding genes were further analyzed with known protein domains using UniProt (Blastp) and indicated that >95 % of predicted proteins showed greater than 90 % identity with annotated proteins in UniProt (Supplementary Table S3, S4). In case of B. megaterium, 91.7 % of proteins revealed hit to Bacillus sp. whereas 97.6 % of proteins in B. subtilis to Bacillus sp."

              "Following the Wu and Scott (2012) procedure, genome based phylogenetic analysis was carried out wherein 31 marker genes which are universally distributed in both bacteria and archaeal genomes were considered, which revealed that both BM89 and BS87 genomes are closely related to Bacillus group ( Fig. 2 a). As reported earlier ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), the homology search using nucleotide blast of the assembled genome with 16S ribosomal RNA sequences and further the ribosomal gene prediction on the genome (barrnap v.0.9), the predicted ribosomal gene sequences showed that the BM89 sequence had hit identity of 99 % with full coverage to Bacillus megaterium NBRC 15,308 = ATCC 14,581 complete genome and the corresponding distance tree revealed that it is closely related to Bacillus megaterium group ( Fig. 2 b). Similarly, BS87genome sequence was found closely related to the Bacillus subtilis ( Fig. 2 b).",
              "Pair-wise genome comparison of both of our assembled bacterial genomes ie., BS87 and BM89 was performed using progressive Mauve aligner ( Darling et al., 2010 ), with 20 different bacteria encompassing Enterobacter, Bacillus, Klebsiella, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Shigella, Azotobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium. In the results as presented in Fig. 3 , BM89 showed only 52.21 % similarity (with coverage of 71.62 %) to B. flexus while BS87 exhibited 73.16 % similarity (with coverage of 75.91 %) to B. halotolerans . As described earlier ( Chandra et al., 2018 ) and further the present phylogenetics based study ( Fig. 2 ), clearly identified and showed closeness of these two bacterial strains to B. megaterium (BM89) and B. subtilis (BS87). However the genome comparison though placed them into the Bacillaceae family but exhibited only reasonable closeness of these two strains with B. flexus and B. halotolerans ( Fig. 3 ). Since the total genome sequence coverage of the present bacterial strains are up to 70 % to that of the maximum genome size reported ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ; Sharma and Satyanarayana, 2013 ), therefore the regions so far covered have eventually placed them in Bacillaceae family. Gupta et al. (2014) , reported consistency in results of pair-wise genome comparison to that of phylogenetic analysis, having sequence coverage of bacterial strains over 80 %. Genome based phylogenetic information is primarily dependant on the homologous representation of 31 marker genes and possibly this would have been less complemented by BM89 and BS87 genome sequence so far covered. Pair-wise genome comparison would follow the 16S rRNA based grouping as genome sequence coverage is extended."

              "Genome of both bacteria was functionally analyzed contemplating gene ontology (GO), SEED classification and KEGG pathways. GO based classification revealed a total of 3343 annotated genes for BM89. Among them, 1400, 954 and 989 genes were assigned to molecular function, cellular component and biological process respectively ( Fig. 4 ). In case of BS87, a total of 4351 genes were annotated. Of these, 1910, 1246 and 1195 genes were assigned to molecular function, cellular component and biological process respectively ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table S5, S6). In both bacteria, genes under the categories of molecular function and biological processes, catalytic, binding, transporter, structural molecular, transcription regulator, antioxidant, cell adhesion, asexual sporulation and carbohydrate utilization based proteins were observed in abundant, helping bacteria to grow fast and promote plant growth. Similarly for cellular component, more number of genes were assigned with cell, membrane and organelle parts ( Fig. 4 ). Kegg pathways’ assignment revealed 1345 and 1492 proteins for BM89 and BS87 respectively, and the top 20 pathways largely represented metabolism, carbon fixation, biosynthesis, flagellar assembly transporter and two component system, succinctly involved in plant growth and metabolism ( Fig. 4 d, e, Supplementary Table S7, S8, S9). In BM89, ribosome and two component system pathways embodied more proteins compared to other pathways, while in case of BS87, two component system and ABC transporters pathways exhibited more proteins. The SEED annotated genome of both bacteria was compared to hundreds of genomes maintained within the SEED integration and further RAST annotation server created pie chart depicted 27 functional categories ( Fig. 5 ). Of these 27 functional categories, some categories namely photosynthesis and phages, prophages, transposable elements, plasmids in BM89 and photosynthesis and motility and chemotaxis in BS87 were not represented by any genes ( Fig. 5 a, b). Dominance of genes and pathways associated with amino acid derivates, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, cofactors, vitamins and pigments synthesis in both bacteria were observed. However genes associated with carbohydrate and amino acid derivative pathways were more in BM89 than those of BS87. Selective superiority of BM89 is corroborated as multiple genes involved in important functions regarding plant growth promotion, soil and plant colonization and other relevant attributes of biotechnological interest, as has been recently reported in a B. megaterium strain STB1 genome ( Nascimento et al., 2020 ).",
              "Functional categories like carbohydrates, amino acid derivates, cofactors/ vitamins and biotic and abiotic stress were represented by many genes in both BM89 and BS87. In general, these genes helped plant growth and metabolism by improving nutrient availability, providing resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses and reducing impact of toxic compounds by metabolizing them into less toxic compounds. Genes and homologs of superoxide dismutase, catalases, sugar transport, glucokinases, cytochrome C, proline synthesizing enzyme, γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA), IAA production, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production and N-acetyl transferase as observed either selectively or in both of these bacteria ( Table 4 ), supported their role in plant growth promotion ( Gupta et al., 2014 ). The γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) gene ( GabP ) as selectively found in BM89, reported to involve in suppression of disease and pest ( Loper et al., 2012 ). Similarly, the phenazine biosynthesis gene (phzF, phzC, phzO) as observed in BS87, supports its role in suppressing different phytopathogens and better survival in soil rhizosphere ( McDonald and Mavrodi, 2001 ). Phenazine (antibiotic) acts as bio-control agent and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) being the key intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of phenazine antibiotics ( Chin-A-Woeng et al., 2003 ), is regulated by phenazine biosynthesis genes ( Makarand et al., 2007 ).",
              "The fact that these two bacteria have the ability to produce and secrete siderophores, normally used by bacteria for iron acquisition to exhibit bio-control activity, as also indicated in our earlier reports ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), was further strengthened by the genome analysis wherein genes associated with the production and utilization of siderophore, especially those linked with thio-esterase production were primarily seen in BS87 genome. It is utmost important that the identified bacteria possess genes needed to not only survive in existing rhizosphere, but also exhibit and provide conducive environment to create and change the nutrient dynamics for better growth. At perusal of Table 4 , the major genes attributed to plant growth promotion in genome of either or both of these two bacteria, were glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glucose 1-dehydrogenase, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase and trehalose operon transcriptional repressor associated with trehalose metabolism, cold shock protein of CSP family, heat shock protein 60 family chaperone GroeL/S, genes associated with glycine betaine production and metabolism (Glycine betaine ABC transport system, ATP-binding protein OpuaA, glycine betaine-binding protein OpuaC, permease protein OpuaB, glycine betaine transporter OpuD), thiol peroxidase (Bcp-type), catalase (Manganese YdbD, KatE), superoxide dismutase (Fe), and gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) permease, which depicted that these two bacteria sufficiently had plant growth promotion and stress tolerance exerting beneficial attributes. Genes for trehalose metabolism and phenazine production were selectively found in BM87, whereas genes for production of γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and d -cysteine desulfhydrase were found in BM89. Kegg pathways’ assignment also revealed that the genome of both bacteria exhibited genes and pathways for carbohydrate metabolism included glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis, glyoxlate and decarboxylate metabolism and the pyruvate metabolism, needed to survive in soil environment and plant rhizospheres. However, BS87 showed selectively the pathways for pentose phosphate, fructose and mannose metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, starch and sucrose metabolism and phenyl alanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and BM89 for prokaryotic carbon fixation, butanoate metabolism, biofilm formation, bacterial secretion system and flageller assembly, clearly indicating differential potential of these two bacteria towards their own survival and establishments in soil rhizosphere and exerting plant growth promotion ability including stress tolerance. Presence of more conducive pathways and availability of better genes attributable to plant growth promotion, proposes superiority of BS87 strain over BM89. BS87 has got better ability to utilize large varieties of plant-derived carbohydrates as carbon source and efficiently metabolize large numbers of amino acids (Supplementary Table S10, S11). Trehalose uptake that can potentially allow BS87 to use exogenous trehalose as better growth promotional attribute was found well supported by the presence of PTS system (trehalose-specific IIB/IIC components), trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase and trehalose operon transcriptional repressor genes in its genome. Due to high salt or osmotic stress, trehalose (disaccharide) is normally accumulated in microorganisms and helps them to grow better under these stresses and play an important role in rhizobium-legume symbiosis and root nodules on soybean plants ( Sugawara et al., 2010 )."

Settlings exposed to bacterial strains showed more vigour and both shoot and root growth was almost double to that of unexposed settlings. As reported earlier ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), biochemical attributes namely chlorophyll content, nitrate reductase activity and total soluble proteins in exposed settlings were significantly higher than those of control (data not shown). Azospirillum and Pseudomonas inoculated maize exhibited increased plant growth and yield ( Vacheron et al., 2013 ). Shakeel et al. (2015) have reported that root associated Bacillus sp. improved growth and yield of basmati rice ( Oryza sativa ) varieties. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the exposed settlings grown under sterilized condition, showed root colonization of sugarcane transplants by both BS87 and BM89 bacteria ( Fig. 6 ). Both of these bacterial strains originally isolated from sugarcane rhizosphere, exhibited strong colonization with sugarcane transplants when settlings were exposed in isolation, indicating suitability of such strains in improved crop growth. Wang et al. (2019) demonstrated colonization and improved contents of chlorophyll, proline, and phytohormones leading to improved drought tolerance in sugarcane plants when exposed to plant growth promoting rhizobacteria Streptomyces chartreusis WZS021. B. megaterium strain STB1 exhibited traits related to soil and rhizosphere colonization ( Nascimento et al., 2020 ), indicating colonization property is is predominantly found in Bacillus group of bacteria."

          "In the present work, we have analyzed the whole genome sequence of two potential strains of plant growth promoting bacteria, namely B. megaterium (BM89) and B. subtilis (BS87). These bacteria, isolated from recurrent sugarcane grown areas exhibited genes both attributable to plant growth promotion and according stress tolerance vis a vis better utilization of energy and carbon source by the isolated bacteria itself. Additionally, presence of genes for phenazine biosynthesis, γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and d -cysteine desulfhydrase indicated their suitability towards bio-control and defense capabilities. Genome assembly and genome comparison results indicated comparable size of the genome to that of reported species, having >3000 protein coding genes with functional annotation and corresponding pathways. Genome analysis information including the presence of genes and metabolic pathways accentuated better performance ability of BS87 over BM89. Gene for phenazine biosynthesis as found in BS87, further indicated its bio-control ability apart from its own better survival in soil environments. Accumulation of disaccharide trehalose and presence of genes responsible for its synthesis in BS87 bolstered its role in strengthening plant beneficial microorganism symbiotic association especially under salt and osmotic stress conditions. Presence of heat, cold shock proteins and glycine betaine genes also showed better adaptability of BS87 towards harsh conditions for survival. These added characteristics imparting better colonization ability eventually strengthened utilization of such bacterial strain as bio-fertilizer even for harsh environmental conditions to improve sugarcane ratoon crop productivity in particular. Also, identification and utilization of associated genes can be part of a comprehensive plant growth promoting strategy including seeking tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in general. The present data and valuable information derived from this study could be useful for further studies."

The genomic DNA was fragmented using Covaris to generate 300–400 bp fragments. 100 ng fragmented genomic DNA was used to generate sequencing library using NEBNext ® UltraTM II DNA library preparation kit for Illumina. The fragmented DNA was subjected to end repair and A–tailing and adapters were ligated. Ampure based bead size selection was performed to get the library of 400 bp and size selected DNA were enriched by PCR amplification using Illumina index adapter primers. Further the amplified products were purified using Ampure beads to remove unbound primers. Libraries were quantified using Qubit DNA HS quantitation assay kit (Thermo Scientific) as this specifically quantified dsDNA. Quality of this was checked using TapeStation high sensitive D1000 ScreenTape. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality of raw reads sequence was checked using FASTQC and further processed using TrimGalore (V: 0.5.0). The processed reads were assembled using SPAdes (V: 3.11.1) de novo assembler with default parameters."

Using bud chips, nursery was raised in plastic trays almost 15–20 days before actual transplanting. Manual bud chipper was used to scoop out bud chips from whole sugarcane setts (seed). These chips were placed in an upright position in trays filled with sterilized soil mixture having sand, organic matter and soil (1:1:1) and were irrigated regularly till it developed to 3–4 leaves in 15–20 days. To expose the 15 days old settlings (12), bacterial cultures (BS87 and BM89) were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in nutrient broth. Settlings of almost same length were kept in a flask containing bacterial culture so that complete root part was exposed to bacterial culture for 2 h. Then, they were transplanted in plastic pots and covered with sterilized soil leaving about 5 cm of the shoot above the ground level. Experiment was performed in three replications each having 12 plants. After two weeks, plant height including root length was recorded. To visualize the colonization, root was first thoroughly washed with tap water to remove all soil particles and finally rinsed with distilled water and dried using soft tissue paper. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) visualization was carried out after fixing the root samples in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h. The samples were replenished with fresh fixative after 2 h. Before visualization samples were rinsed five times with 7% sucrose solution to remove any traces of glutaraldehyde attached with the samples. The fixed samples were dehydrated using serially diluted ethanol (30, 50, 70, and 80 % for 15 min each and then with 90 % ethanol for 20 min and finally with 100 % for 30 min). The samples were then subjected to critical point drying and then samples were mounted on stubs with the help of double stick tape and sputtered with a film of gold using an ion-beam sputter coater. Root samples were visualized under FEI Quanta 250 Scanning Electron Microscope (CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India).

Climate change has necessitated the employment of green energy and sugarcane perfectly fits in system providing bulk raw material in the form of bagasse and juice for the production of bio-ethanol. In India, >5 mha area is under this crop, about equally distributed in tropical and sub-tropical part of the country. In view of increased demand of green energy internationally, productivity of cane needs to be enhanced worldwide without involving any increase in input namely water, fertilizers and pesticides ( Solomon et al., 2019 ). Moreover, recent change in government policy to utilize sugarcane juice directly to make bio-ethanol, has led to a sudden increase in demand of this crop in India too. In recent past, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been found to be a potent bio-stimulant/ bio-fertilizer having the ability to improve growth by maneuvering soil dynamics and thus providing conducive environment for crop growth ( Tiwari et al., 2016 ; Nascimento et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). In general, such bacteria modulate plant growth promoting plant growth substances in the plant, checking growth and spread of harmful organisms and enhancing uptake and availability of minerals and nutrients; thus constituting a viable alternative to the rampant use of chemicals in agriculture ( Lalande et al., 1989 ; Sessitsch et al., 2018 ). Colonization of such bacteria with the plant rhizosphere has been well documented ( Chin et al., 2000 ). Since sugarcane is a C 4 ratoon crop, its root stay in soil usually more than a year and therefore different kinds of microbes experience favorable conditions to multiply and prosper. Several bacteria have been isolated and characterized from surface sterilized root and largely reported as nitrogen fixing endophytes ( Döbereiner, 1992 ; Baldani and Baldani, 2005 ) resulting in up to 35 % increment in production ( Boddey et al., 2003 ). In view of the potential application of such bacteria isolated from native environment (rhizopshere) of the crop to be used as bio-fertilizer, the dominant native bacteria needs to be analyzed for better understanding about molecular mechanism of plant growth promotion as well as bio-controls and eventually their utilization to promote and protect plant growth and sustainability. As such, the identification and characterization of genes and regulatory sequences responsible for the beneficial activity of such bacteria are important to widen their applicability. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has greatly facilitated whole genome sequencing of bacteria and other organism ( Schuster, 2008 ; Subramaniam et al., 2020 ) and data generated have helped in better understanding of molecular genetics of bacterial species isolated from crops, soils and herbal vermicompost ( Matilla et al., 2011 ; Mathimaran et al., 2012 ; Subramaniam et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Though selective information about sugarcane rhizospheres viz., how rhizospheric changes impede crop growth and further, how its improvement through bio-agents amended farm yard manure, is available ( Shukla et al., 2008 ; Singh et al., 2013a ). However, the extensive study especially based on whole genome sequence of PGPR isolated from sugarcane rhizospheres and their impact on vivacity of sugarcane rhizosphere is lacking. In our previous work on sugarcane soil rhizosphere ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), among many bacterial isolates, Bacillus strains exhibiting potential role in plant growth promotion have been identified. Dominance of bacteria especially Bacillus spp. has been seen in soils and constitutes major members of the microbiome of many plant hosts worldwide ( Mendes et al., 2013 ) and most of these have been reported as PGPR ( Trivedi and Pandey, 2008 ; Esringü et al., 2014 ; Chandra et al., 2018 ). Further, strains of this species have been reported to colonize well with soils and plant tissues and produce different sets of bioactive compounds that stimulate plant growth and antiphytopathogen activities ( Yu et al., 2002 ). Recently, a comprehensive genome analysis of a stress resistant B. megaterium strain (STB1) has revealed rich genetic elements involved in multiple stress resistance, xenobiotic degradation, pathogen antagonistic activities and other traits related to soil and rhizosphere colonization ( Nascimento et al., 2020 ). In India, sugarcane ratoon crops are not much preferred owing to reduced yield in consecutive years of crop period ( Suman et al., 2005 ; Singh et al., 2013b ). In order to address such issues and to improve overall crop productivity, rhizosphere of sugarcane has been analyzed and therefore present study is aimed to have in-depth genomic insight into one strain each of B. subtilis (BS87) and B. megaterium (BM89), employing next generation sequencing so as to generate PGPRs associated characteristics to facilitate further study and provide an economically safe nutrient management strategy targeting them as potent bio-fertilizers. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characteristics of two bacterial isolates and plant growth promotional functions Of the many bacterial isolates isolated from sugarcane rhizosphere soils and further based on biochemical test and 16S rRNA gene sequences, two isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium ( Chandra et al., 2018 ). These two isolates were submitted to ICAR-National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganism (NBAIM), India and were accessioned as NAIMCC-B-02187 and NAIMCC-B-02189 respectively, indicating their uniqueness. At the perusal of Tables 1 and 2 , it is summarized that both B. subtilis (hereafter, BS87) and B. megaterium (hereafter, BM89) isolates were distinct in their biochemical attributes. In the 35 biochemical tests performed, both of them showed 11 positive reactions and only five tests were common. When plant growth promotional attributes namely phosphate, zinc solubilization, ACC deaminase activity and production of siderophore, IAA and ammonia were compared, BS87 showed better activities than those of BM89 ( Table 2 ). Both the isolates possessed rod shape morphology and were positive for Gram’s staining and endospore producing. The pH tolerance for these two bacteria ranged from 5 to 8, indicating possibility of much more diversity among the strains of the two species as they showed prolific growth in acidic environment. Earlier reports have indicated pH as the best predictor of soil bacterial diversity and richness, with the lower levels of bacterial diversity and richness observed in acid soils ( Fierer and Jackson, 2006 ). Bacteria isolated from arecanut rhizosphere have shown tolerance to low pH and possessed plant growth promoting attributes ( Gupta et al., 2014 ). In general, sugarcane ratoon rhizosphere soil tends to become acidic (pH < 5.0) in nature ( Singh et al., 2007 ), thus these two bacterial strains would survive better under such condition and induce better growth of the crop. 2.2 Whole genome sequence, assembly and gene prediction A total of 27,552,484 processed reads for BM89 and 32,478,520 for BS87 were obtained when sequencing of the genome of these two bacterial strains was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform. The sequences were trimmed and those with Phread score of > 30 were finally filtered at 28.57 and 30.16 % respectively. The average read length for both BM89 and BS87 was 150bp whereas GC content was 40 % and 45 % respectively. Genome assembly as presented in Table 3 , BM89 genome was finally assembled in 3 contigs with a total length of 3,870,818 bp (N50 of 3,720,580) and BS87 into one contig with a total length of 3,296,945 bp (N50 of 3,296,945). The estimated genome size based on the sequence data was 3.9 Mb for B. megaterium BM89 and 3.3 Mb for B. subtilis BS87. Phylogenetic analysis which is derived using 31 conserved housekeeping protein-coding genes ( Wu and Scott, 2012 ), confirmed both bacteria belong to Bacillaceae family. Genome sizes of the members of this family have been reported to range from 2.8 to 5.8 Mb ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ; Sharma and Satyanarayana, 2013 ), and the two bacteria sequenced in the present study fall well within this range. Augustus tool which uses Hidden Markov model predicted 4693 and 3372 protein coding genes in BM89 and BS87 genome respectively. Sharma and Satyanarayana (2013) have predicted 5124 and 4100 genes for these two species respectively. Konstantinidis and Tiedje (2004) reported a robust correlation between the genome size and the numbers of genes it encodes. Sharma and Satyanarayana (2013) analyzed complete genome sequences of the member of the Bacillaceae and the average genome size reported was 4.3 Mb and an average of 4364 protein coding gene sequences. Both of these values were found to be well within the range we reported for two different species of Bacillus in the present study. However, when raw data was analyzed through Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (v 2.0) (RAST), only 2720 and 3675 protein coding genes for BM89 and BS87 respectively were observed (Supplementary Table S1, S2). Number of RNA genes from these two bacteria was 50 whereas repeat regions observed were 20 and 17 respectively. Since RAST is an annotation server for microbial genomes, built upon the framework provided by the SEED system, less number of these genes is possible. Also, RAST server did not consider retaining any protein-encoding gene that significantly overlaps any RNA (tRNA, rRNA) genes, ultimately causes smaller RNA genes visualization ( Aziz et al., 2008 ). The predicted protein coding genes when compared with non-redundant (nr) NCBI database (BLASTX), >95 % predicted non-coding genes possessed homologous protein sequence in NCBI nr protein database ( Fig. 1 ). Among these, 90 % genes showed high confidence match (E-value < = 1.0e −50 ) ( Fig. 1 a). In case of BM89, 58 % genes had identity of at least 80 % with a putative homolog while in case of BS87, 74 % had identity of at least 80 % ( Fig. 1 b). In both the cases, >30 % had identity of 100 % with a putative homolog. All protein-coding genes were further analyzed with known protein domains using UniProt (Blastp) and indicated that >95 % of predicted proteins showed greater than 90 % identity with annotated proteins in UniProt (Supplementary Table S3, S4). In case of B. megaterium, 91.7 % of proteins revealed hit to Bacillus sp. whereas 97.6 % of proteins in B. subtilis to Bacillus sp. 2.3 Phylogeny and pair-wise genome comparison Following the Wu and Scott (2012) procedure, genome based phylogenetic analysis was carried out wherein 31 marker genes which are universally distributed in both bacteria and archaeal genomes were considered, which revealed that both BM89 and BS87 genomes are closely related to Bacillus group ( Fig. 2 a). As reported earlier ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), the homology search using nucleotide blast of the assembled genome with 16S ribosomal RNA sequences and further the ribosomal gene prediction on the genome (barrnap v.0.9), the predicted ribosomal gene sequences showed that the BM89 sequence had hit identity of 99 % with full coverage to Bacillus megaterium NBRC 15,308 = ATCC 14,581 complete genome and the corresponding distance tree revealed that it is closely related to Bacillus megaterium group ( Fig. 2 b). Similarly, BS87genome sequence was found closely related to the Bacillus subtilis ( Fig. 2 b). Pair-wise genome comparison of both of our assembled bacterial genomes ie., BS87 and BM89 was performed using progressive Mauve aligner ( Darling et al., 2010 ), with 20 different bacteria encompassing Enterobacter, Bacillus, Klebsiella, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Shigella, Azotobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium. In the results as presented in Fig. 3 , BM89 showed only 52.21 % similarity (with coverage of 71.62 %) to B. flexus while BS87 exhibited 73.16 % similarity (with coverage of 75.91 %) to B. halotolerans . As described earlier ( Chandra et al., 2018 ) and further the present phylogenetics based study ( Fig. 2 ), clearly identified and showed closeness of these two bacterial strains to B. megaterium (BM89) and B. subtilis (BS87). However the genome comparison though placed them into the Bacillaceae family but exhibited only reasonable closeness of these two strains with B. flexus and B. halotolerans ( Fig. 3 ). Since the total genome sequence coverage of the present bacterial strains are up to 70 % to that of the maximum genome size reported ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ; Sharma and Satyanarayana, 2013 ), therefore the regions so far covered have eventually placed them in Bacillaceae family. Gupta et al. (2014) , reported consistency in results of pair-wise genome comparison to that of phylogenetic analysis, having sequence coverage of bacterial strains over 80 %. Genome based phylogenetic information is primarily dependant on the homologous representation of 31 marker genes and possibly this would have been less complemented by BM89 and BS87 genome sequence so far covered. Pair-wise genome comparison would follow the 16S rRNA based grouping as genome sequence coverage is extended. 2.4 Functional analysis of genomes and genes associated with plant growth promoting attributes Genome of both bacteria was functionally analyzed contemplating gene ontology (GO), SEED classification and KEGG pathways. GO based classification revealed a total of 3343 annotated genes for BM89. Among them, 1400, 954 and 989 genes were assigned to molecular function, cellular component and biological process respectively ( Fig. 4 ). In case of BS87, a total of 4351 genes were annotated. Of these, 1910, 1246 and 1195 genes were assigned to molecular function, cellular component and biological process respectively ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table S5, S6). In both bacteria, genes under the categories of molecular function and biological processes, catalytic, binding, transporter, structural molecular, transcription regulator, antioxidant, cell adhesion, asexual sporulation and carbohydrate utilization based proteins were observed in abundant, helping bacteria to grow fast and promote plant growth. Similarly for cellular component, more number of genes were assigned with cell, membrane and organelle parts ( Fig. 4 ). Kegg pathways’ assignment revealed 1345 and 1492 proteins for BM89 and BS87 respectively, and the top 20 pathways largely represented metabolism, carbon fixation, biosynthesis, flagellar assembly transporter and two component system, succinctly involved in plant growth and metabolism ( Fig. 4 d, e, Supplementary Table S7, S8, S9). In BM89, ribosome and two component system pathways embodied more proteins compared to other pathways, while in case of BS87, two component system and ABC transporters pathways exhibited more proteins. The SEED annotated genome of both bacteria was compared to hundreds of genomes maintained within the SEED integration and further RAST annotation server created pie chart depicted 27 functional categories ( Fig. 5 ). Of these 27 functional categories, some categories namely photosynthesis and phages, prophages, transposable elements, plasmids in BM89 and photosynthesis and motility and chemotaxis in BS87 were not represented by any genes ( Fig. 5 a, b). Dominance of genes and pathways associated with amino acid derivates, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, cofactors, vitamins and pigments synthesis in both bacteria were observed. However genes associated with carbohydrate and amino acid derivative pathways were more in BM89 than those of BS87. Selective superiority of BM89 is corroborated as multiple genes involved in important functions regarding plant growth promotion, soil and plant colonization and other relevant attributes of biotechnological interest, as has been recently reported in a B. megaterium strain STB1 genome ( Nascimento et al., 2020 ). Functional categories like carbohydrates, amino acid derivates, cofactors/ vitamins and biotic and abiotic stress were represented by many genes in both BM89 and BS87. In general, these genes helped plant growth and metabolism by improving nutrient availability, providing resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses and reducing impact of toxic compounds by metabolizing them into less toxic compounds. Genes and homologs of superoxide dismutase, catalases, sugar transport, glucokinases, cytochrome C, proline synthesizing enzyme, γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA), IAA production, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production and N-acetyl transferase as observed either selectively or in both of these bacteria ( Table 4 ), supported their role in plant growth promotion ( Gupta et al., 2014 ). The γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) gene ( GabP ) as selectively found in BM89, reported to involve in suppression of disease and pest ( Loper et al., 2012 ). Similarly, the phenazine biosynthesis gene (phzF, phzC, phzO) as observed in BS87, supports its role in suppressing different phytopathogens and better survival in soil rhizosphere ( McDonald and Mavrodi, 2001 ). Phenazine (antibiotic) acts as bio-control agent and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) being the key intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of phenazine antibiotics ( Chin-A-Woeng et al., 2003 ), is regulated by phenazine biosynthesis genes ( Makarand et al., 2007 ). The fact that these two bacteria have the ability to produce and secrete siderophores, normally used by bacteria for iron acquisition to exhibit bio-control activity, as also indicated in our earlier reports ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), was further strengthened by the genome analysis wherein genes associated with the production and utilization of siderophore, especially those linked with thio-esterase production were primarily seen in BS87 genome. It is utmost important that the identified bacteria possess genes needed to not only survive in existing rhizosphere, but also exhibit and provide conducive environment to create and change the nutrient dynamics for better growth. At perusal of Table 4 , the major genes attributed to plant growth promotion in genome of either or both of these two bacteria, were glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glucose 1-dehydrogenase, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase and trehalose operon transcriptional repressor associated with trehalose metabolism, cold shock protein of CSP family, heat shock protein 60 family chaperone GroeL/S, genes associated with glycine betaine production and metabolism (Glycine betaine ABC transport system, ATP-binding protein OpuaA, glycine betaine-binding protein OpuaC, permease protein OpuaB, glycine betaine transporter OpuD), thiol peroxidase (Bcp-type), catalase (Manganese YdbD, KatE), superoxide dismutase (Fe), and gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) permease, which depicted that these two bacteria sufficiently had plant growth promotion and stress tolerance exerting beneficial attributes. Genes for trehalose metabolism and phenazine production were selectively found in BM87, whereas genes for production of γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and d -cysteine desulfhydrase were found in BM89. Kegg pathways’ assignment also revealed that the genome of both bacteria exhibited genes and pathways for carbohydrate metabolism included glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis, glyoxlate and decarboxylate metabolism and the pyruvate metabolism, needed to survive in soil environment and plant rhizospheres. However, BS87 showed selectively the pathways for pentose phosphate, fructose and mannose metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, starch and sucrose metabolism and phenyl alanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and BM89 for prokaryotic carbon fixation, butanoate metabolism, biofilm formation, bacterial secretion system and flageller assembly, clearly indicating differential potential of these two bacteria towards their own survival and establishments in soil rhizosphere and exerting plant growth promotion ability including stress tolerance. Presence of more conducive pathways and availability of better genes attributable to plant growth promotion, proposes superiority of BS87 strain over BM89. BS87 has got better ability to utilize large varieties of plant-derived carbohydrates as carbon source and efficiently metabolize large numbers of amino acids (Supplementary Table S10, S11). Trehalose uptake that can potentially allow BS87 to use exogenous trehalose as better growth promotional attribute was found well supported by the presence of PTS system (trehalose-specific IIB/IIC components), trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase and trehalose operon transcriptional repressor genes in its genome. Due to high salt or osmotic stress, trehalose (disaccharide) is normally accumulated in microorganisms and helps them to grow better under these stresses and play an important role in rhizobium-legume symbiosis and root nodules on soybean plants ( Sugawara et al., 2010 ). 2.5 Plant growth promotion and bacterial colonization In general, sugarcane sett (seed) raised settlings when exposed to BS87 and BM89 strains; demonstrated better growth as compared to those of control ( Fig. 6 ). Settlings exposed to bacterial strains showed more vigour and both shoot and root growth was almost double to that of unexposed settlings. As reported earlier ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), biochemical attributes namely chlorophyll content, nitrate reductase activity and total soluble proteins in exposed settlings were significantly higher than those of control (data not shown). Azospirillum and Pseudomonas inoculated maize exhibited increased plant growth and yield ( Vacheron et al., 2013 ). Shakeel et al. (2015) have reported that root associated Bacillus sp. improved growth and yield of basmati rice ( Oryza sativa ) varieties. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the exposed settlings grown under sterilized condition, showed root colonization of sugarcane transplants by both BS87 and BM89 bacteria ( Fig. 6 ). Both of these bacterial strains originally isolated from sugarcane rhizosphere, exhibited strong colonization with sugarcane transplants when settlings were exposed in isolation, indicating suitability of such strains in improved crop growth. Wang et al. (2019) demonstrated colonization and improved contents of chlorophyll, proline, and phytohormones leading to improved drought tolerance in sugarcane plants when exposed to plant growth promoting rhizobacteria Streptomyces chartreusis WZS021. B. megaterium strain STB1 exhibited traits related to soil and rhizosphere colonization ( Nascimento et al., 2020 ), indicating colonization property is is predominantly found in Bacillus group of bacteria. 3 Conclusion In the present work, we have analyzed the whole genome sequence of two potential strains of plant growth promoting bacteria, namely B. megaterium (BM89) and B. subtilis (BS87). These bacteria, isolated from recurrent sugarcane grown areas exhibited genes both attributable to plant growth promotion and according stress tolerance vis a vis better utilization of energy and carbon source by the isolated bacteria itself. Additionally, presence of genes for phenazine biosynthesis, γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and d -cysteine desulfhydrase indicated their suitability towards bio-control and defense capabilities. Genome assembly and genome comparison results indicated comparable size of the genome to that of reported species, having >3000 protein coding genes with functional annotation and corresponding pathways. Genome analysis information including the presence of genes and metabolic pathways accentuated better performance ability of BS87 over BM89. Gene for phenazine biosynthesis as found in BS87, further indicated its bio-control ability apart from its own better survival in soil environments. Accumulation of disaccharide trehalose and presence of genes responsible for its synthesis in BS87 bolstered its role in strengthening plant beneficial microorganism symbiotic association especially under salt and osmotic stress conditions. Presence of heat, cold shock proteins and glycine betaine genes also showed better adaptability of BS87 towards harsh conditions for survival. These added characteristics imparting better colonization ability eventually strengthened utilization of such bacterial strain as bio-fertilizer even for harsh environmental conditions to improve sugarcane ratoon crop productivity in particular. Also, identification and utilization of associated genes can be part of a comprehensive plant growth promoting strategy including seeking tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in general. The present data and valuable information derived from this study could be useful for further studies. 4 Material and methods 4.1 Sampling, isolation and characteristics of plant growth promoting bacteria As described earlier ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), out of 101 bacterial cultures isolated from rhizospheric soil of fields where sugarcane is being grown for >50 years (ICAR-Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow, India, 26°56′N, 80°52′E and 111 m above sea level), finally 2 strains namely BSSC11 and BMSE7 were further characterized and identified as B. subtilis and B. megaterium respectively ( Chandra et al., 2018 ). Soils of these fields were largely sandy loam (13.3 % clay, 24.5 % silt and 62.2 % sand) of Indo-Gangetic alluvial origin, and are classified as non-calcareous mixed with hyperthermic udic ustochrept . These strains were accessioned as NAIMCC-B-02,187 (BS87) and NAIMCC-B-02,189 (BM89) respectively. In view of their importance and utility whole genome sequencing of these strains were carried out. Pure culture of these two bacteria was maintained using standard culture media and kept in nutrient agar slants at 4 °C. These were further screened for plant growth-promoting properties namely phosphate solubilizing property ( Tokala et al., 2002 ), production of siderophore, IAA, NH 3 , HCN ( Tokala et al., 2002 ; Yadav et al., 2010 ) and zinc solubilisation property ( Saravanan et al., 2003 ) using standard protocols. Nutrient content, shoot, root weight and activities of antioxidant enzyme system were analyzed in one month old sugarcane settlings initially exposed to these two bacteria (15 days old stage) as described earlier ( Chandra et al., 2018 ). 4.2 Genomic DNA isolation, library preparation and whole genome sequencing Genomic DNA was isolated from B. subtilis (BS87) and B. megaterium (BM89) culture initially grown on medium at 37 °C for 1–2 days, following standard bacterial DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA was run on 1% agarose gel for quality and quantity check. Quantification was also done using Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The genomic DNA was fragmented using Covaris to generate 300–400 bp fragments. 100 ng fragmented genomic DNA was used to generate sequencing library using NEBNext ® UltraTM II DNA library preparation kit for Illumina. The fragmented DNA was subjected to end repair and A–tailing and adapters were ligated. Ampure based bead size selection was performed to get the library of 400 bp and size selected DNA were enriched by PCR amplification using Illumina index adapter primers. Further the amplified products were purified using Ampure beads to remove unbound primers. Libraries were quantified using Qubit DNA HS quantitation assay kit (Thermo Scientific) as this specifically quantified dsDNA. Quality of this was checked using TapeStation high sensitive D1000 ScreenTape. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality of raw reads sequence was checked using FASTQC and further processed using TrimGalore (V: 0.5.0). The processed reads were assembled using SPAdes (V: 3.11.1) de novo assembler with default parameters. 4.3 Gene prediction and annotation The protein coding genes prediction was performed using both Rapid Annotation Subsystem Technology (v.2.0) (RAST) server which identified protein encoding genes (PEGs), RNA genes and repeat regions and Augustus tool (default settings) which uses the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). These genes were then blasted with UniProt Knowledge base to predict the Gene Ids and Proteins. The resultant stacked bar graph represented the percentage of predicted protein coding genes with significant matches (E-value > = 1.0 e10 −5 ) in the NCBI nr-protein database identified using BLASTX and the proportion of proteins binned by percent identity measured by BLASTX alignment. RAST server helped annotation of microbial genomes, built upon the frame work provided by the SEED system ( Aziz et al., 2008 ). KEGG pathway assignment of the predicted proteins was performed using KEGG server (KAAS). The annotated genes were inspected for identifying those involved in PGP functions, pathogen suppression, abiotic stress tolerance, rhizosphere competence, carbohydrate metabolism and other important relevant functions. 4.4 Phylogenetic analysis Genome based phylogenetic analysis was performed using AMPHORA2 ( Wu and Scott, 2012 ). It scans for 31 markers genes which are universally distributed in both bacteria and archaeal genomes. The 31 marker genes identified in both genomes were further aligned with ClustalW ( Snyder et al., 2007 ). Phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstraps was inferred using the maximum likelihood (ML) method and depicted at different nodes. The 16S rRNA sequence based phylogenetic tree was created and homology search was performed using nucleotide blast of the assembled genomes with 16S ribosomal RNA sequences to reveal the closely related groups. Since BM89 genome had no hits to the database, ribosomal gene prediction on the genome was achieved using barrnap (v.0.9) and the predicted sequence was then subjected to homology search in the NCBI database. 4.5 Genome comparison We compared our assembled genomes of B. subtilis and B. megaterium with the available complete bacterial genomes using progressive Mauve aligner ( Darling et al., 2010 ) with default settings. PATRIC database ( http://patricbrc.vbi.vt.edu ) was used to get the published genomes and further used in the present alignment ( Snyder et al., 2007 ), and pair-wise similarity was calculated using sequence alignment file generated by the Mauve aligner. The colored blocks represented the homologous region between the genomes that were internally free from genomic rearrangement. For computing the similarity score, regions with less than 50 continuous gaps were taken. Similarity score were based on the pair-wise sequence similarity % and coverage score which represents the % of genome that have aligned pair-wise. 4.6 Plant growth promotion by the native isolates and SEM analysis for bacterial colonization The study was performed using CoLk94184, an early and high sugar accumulating variety of sugarcane. Using bud chips, nursery was raised in plastic trays almost 15–20 days before actual transplanting. Manual bud chipper was used to scoop out bud chips from whole sugarcane setts (seed). These chips were placed in an upright position in trays filled with sterilized soil mixture having sand, organic matter and soil (1:1:1) and were irrigated regularly till it developed to 3–4 leaves in 15–20 days. To expose the 15 days old settlings (12), bacterial cultures (BS87 and BM89) were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in nutrient broth. Settlings of almost same length were kept in a flask containing bacterial culture so that complete root part was exposed to bacterial culture for 2 h. Then, they were transplanted in plastic pots and covered with sterilized soil leaving about 5 cm of the shoot above the ground level. Experiment was performed in three replications each having 12 plants. After two weeks, plant height including root length was recorded. To visualize the colonization, root was first thoroughly washed with tap water to remove all soil particles and finally rinsed with distilled water and dried using soft tissue paper. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) visualization was carried out after fixing the root samples in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h. The samples were replenished with fresh fixative after 2 h. Before visualization samples were rinsed five times with 7% sucrose solution to remove any traces of glutaraldehyde attached with the samples. The fixed samples were dehydrated using serially diluted ethanol (30, 50, 70, and 80 % for 15 min each and then with 90 % ethanol for 20 min and finally with 100 % for 30 min). The samples were then subjected to critical point drying and then samples were mounted on stubs with the help of double stick tape and sputtered with a film of gold using an ion-beam sputter coater. Root samples were visualized under FEI Quanta 250 Scanning Electron Microscope (CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India). An image analyzer attached to the microscope captured the secondary images of the samples at different magnification levels. Database accession number and data availability Genome sequence data base of both BS87 and BM89 bacteria as discussed in the manuscript have been deposited in NCBI SRA module and are accessible through Accession Nos. SRR11870891 (PRJNA634628) for BS87 and SRR8887017 (PRJNA531071) for BM89.
