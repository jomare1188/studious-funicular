            "text": "Sugarcane, a C 4 plant belonging to the botanical family Gramineae (Poaceae), is extensively cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its high photosynthetic efficiency, it is one of the most productive field crops [ 1 ]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, sugarcane supplies 80% of the world’s sugar and 40% of its bioethanol, with a direct agro-economic value of $96 billion, establishing it as a vital sugar and energy crop (FAO, 2022). This success is attributed to the utilization of wild sugarcane germplasm and the success of sexual cross-breeding, resulting in numerous superior varieties. The nobilization theory, which underpins the exploitation of wild sugarcane germplasm, has significantly advanced the breeding process [ 2 ]. Modern cultivated sugarcane is produced through a process known as nobilization breeding. This process involves crossing two founding species, Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum spontaneum . The progeny from this initial cross is then further crossed with S. officinarum to develop the modern cultivars [ 3 ]. To obtain sugarcane varieties with excellent comprehensive traits, high sugar and high yield genes derived from S. officinarum could be enriched through hybridization and backcross. Meanwhile, high resistance and stress tolerance of S. spontaneum could also be infiltrated during the process of nobilization [ 2 ]. In this process, “noble species” S. officinarum with male sterile can only serve as the female parent, resulting in the narrow genetic basis for modern sugarcane cultivars [ 4 , 5 ]."

            "text": "The organelles in eukaryotic cells are believed to have originated from ancient endosymbiotic events. Their genomes are considered remnants of ancient eubacteria, independent of the nuclear genome, and typically exhibit maternal inheritance [ 6 , 7 ]. Mitochondria, as semiautonomous organelles in eukaryotic cells, provide essential energy for various life activities and are widely used in studies on species origin, genetic diversity, and phylogenetics [ 8 , 9 – 10 ]. The rapid development of sequencing and genome assembly technologies, has gradually resolved the complex polyploid genomes of Saccharum species. This progress has greatly facilitated research in gene family identification, genetic mapping, population genetics, and genome evolution analysis in sugarcane [ 1 , 11 , 12 – 13 ]. However, the mitochondrial genomes of sugarcane, particularly S. spontaneum , have not been comprehensively and systematically characterized [ 14 , 15 – 16 ]. According to the NCBI database, 18,218 mitochondrial genomes have been published, but only 465 mitochondrial genomes from flowering plants (Angiosperm) have been sequenced ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/organelle/ , accessed on September 10, 2024). This limited number is primarily due to the complex size and structural characteristics of plant mitochondrial genomes compared to those of animals [ 17 , 18 ]. Plant mitochondrial genomes are known to integrate DNA from various sources through intracellular and horizontal transfer, resulting in significant variation among species [ 9 , 19 ]. Despite this variation, plant mitochondrial genomes exhibit much lower mutation rates than their nuclear and chloroplast counterparts, making them highly conserved within a species and useful for interspecific marker development [ 20 , 21 ]. Additionally, plant mitochondrial genomes contain complex non-coding and repeated regions, which include many chimeric genes and open reading frames ( ORFs ), some of which may contribute to cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) [ 22 , 23 ]. Despite these insights, the molecular mechanisms underlying CMS in sugarcane remain unresolved."

Further, we identified potentially CMS-related ORF in sugarcane and developed two co-dominant simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers sufficient to distinguish the cytoplasmic types between S. officinarum and S. spontaneum . These findings contribute to understanding the CMS mechanism in sugarcane, and hold theoretical value for broadening the genetic base and facilitating sexual hybrid breeding in sugarcane."

Mitochondrial contigs were then identified in each draft assembly using the BLASTN program [ 27 ] with the reference mitochondrial genome of the sugarcane cultivar Khon Kaen 3 (accession numbers: LC107874 and LC107875). The WGS data were assembled into a uniting graph with GetOrganelle. This graph-based assembly was visualized using Bandage software [ 28 ] and manually refined by removing nodes derived from chloroplast and nuclear DNA.

The average depth of the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome was 120.1x for CCS reads and 178.5x for Illumina reads. For the S. officinarum mitochondrial genome, the average depth was 110.6x for CCS reads and 260.7x for Illumina reads (Fig. S2 and Fig. S3 ).

In this study, we obtained the circular chloroplast genomes for both S. spontaneum (141,186 bp) and S. officinarum (141,180 bp) (Fig. 2 A). These chloroplast genomes exhibit typical quadripartite characteristics and demonstrate high conservation in organization and structure, featuring a large single-copy (LSC) region, a small single-copy (SSC) region, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions. Variations in chloroplast genome length and gene copy numbers commonly arise from expansions and contractions of IR regions. We compared the boundaries of IR and single-copy regions in the two Saccharum species (Fig. 2 B). The LSC and IR regions of the chloroplast genomes differed by only 20 bp and 7 bp, respectively."

For example, in S. officinarum , ndhH is located entirely in the SSC, whereas in S. spontaneum , ndhH has a 1 bp embedding in the IRb. Additionally, in S. spontaneum , ndhF is located in the JSA, while in S. officinarum , ndhF is located in the JSB. Further characterization of the differences between the chloroplast genomes of the two Saccharum species was conducted using mVISTA, with S. spontaneum as a reference. The results showed that the differences between the two sugarcane chloroplast genomes primarily occur in the regions of conserved non-coding sequences, with the LSC and IRa regions exhibiting greater differences than the SSC and IRb regions (Fig. 2 C). The assembly of the chloroplast genomes, along with the availability of nuclear genomes [ 11 ] ( https://sugarcane.gxu.edu.cn/scdb/download ), has enabled the analysis of intracellular gene transfer in sugarcane."

Notably, the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum showed a high degree of similarity in both size and sequence to that of Khon Kaen 3, a commercial cultivar previously identified as having a maternal origin in a S. officinarum species [ 16 ] (Fig. S4). This finding illustrates the conservation of the mitochondrial genome within the species and validates the reliability of our assembly. The transfer of DNA fragments among nuclear and organellar genomes is a common event in plant evolution. Our results indicate that the mitochondrial genomes of S. spontaneum and S. officinarum encompass 59 and 52 MTPTs, respectively. These sequences cover 31,596 bp (5.58%) and 28,939 bp (6.50%) of the mitochondrial genomes in the two Saccharum species. Moreover, these MTPTs exhibit an uneven distribution within the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species (Fig. 3 A, Table S3 and S4 )."

The length of repeat sequences in S. spontaneum is more than five times that in S. officinarum , which likely contributes to the structural complexity and the presence of an additional circular molecule in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum. We conducted a further collinearity analysis of the S. officinarum and S. spontaneum mitochondrial genomes and analyzed the sequences unique to each species. The analysis shows that a 486,335 bp region of the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum has high collinearity with a 411,806 bp region of the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum (Fig. 3 B, Table S7 ). This can be attributed to the presence of multiple copies of repeat sequences in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum , resulting in good collinearity between multiple genomic regions of the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome and the same mitochondrial genomic region of S. officinarum (Fig. 3 B, Table S5 and Table S6 )."

In contrast, in the unique mitochondrial genome region of S. officinarum (45.68 kb), we identified only 20 NUMTs covering a total of 33.10 kb. We then randomly selected six regions containing NUMTs unique to each sugarcane mitochondrial genome for PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 3 B). The PCR products showed differences between the two Saccharum species, and the sequences obtained from Sanger sequencing were fully aligned with the mitochondrial genome reference sequences (Fig. 3 C and Fig. S5 ).

We obtained 30 and 35 candidate SSR markers and designed primers for S. spontaneum and S. officinarum , respectively (Table S11 and S12 ). Among these, 15 pairs of primer sequences were identical between the two Saccharum species, and 12 of these primer pairs were predicted to have the same product size in the two Saccharum species and were discarded in further analysis. Using agarose gel electrophoresis, we found that the 12 SSR markers exhibited differences in product size between the two Saccharum species (Fig. S8 A). Subsequently, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was utilized to finalize two co-dominant SSR markers. These markers showed distinct band size differences between the two Saccharum species and displayed only S. officinarum type bands in sugarcane cultivars, making them excellent for distinguishing sugarcane cytoplasmic types (Fig. S8 B-C). Moreover, these two markers perform consistently in agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6 ), demonstrating the convenience and accuracy of applying these markers for identifying sugarcane cytoplasmic types."

Initially, we obtained two complex assembly graphs using Illumina-based assembly (Fig. S1 ). We then used a hybrid assembly model to separately reconstruct and present the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species as molecular circles (Fig. 1 ). The lengths of the two molecular circles of S. officinarum were 300,828 bp and 144,727 bp, respectively, while the molecular sizes of the three circles of S. spontaneum were 299,685 bp, 156,834 bp and 109,235 bp, respectively. Finally, we mapped the Illumina reads and CCS reads to the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species. The average depth of the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome was 120.1x for CCS reads and 178.5x for Illumina reads. For the S. officinarum mitochondrial genome, the average depth was 110.6x for CCS reads and 260.7x for Illumina reads (Fig. S2 and Fig. S3 ). The sequencing depth statistics for each locus of the mitochondrial genome showed that we obtained two gap-free genomes, indicating the high quality of our assemblies."

In this study, we obtained the circular chloroplast genomes for both S. spontaneum (141,186 bp) and S. officinarum (141,180 bp) (Fig. 2 A). These chloroplast genomes exhibit typical quadripartite characteristics and demonstrate high conservation in organization and structure, featuring a large single-copy (LSC) region, a small single-copy (SSC) region, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions. Variations in chloroplast genome length and gene copy numbers commonly arise from expansions and contractions of IR regions. We compared the boundaries of IR and single-copy regions in the two Saccharum species (Fig. 2 B). The LSC and IR regions of the chloroplast genomes differed by only 20 bp and 7 bp, respectively."

For example, in S. officinarum , ndhH is located entirely in the SSC, whereas in S. spontaneum , ndhH has a 1 bp embedding in the IRb. Additionally, in S. spontaneum , ndhF is located in the JSA, while in S. officinarum , ndhF is located in the JSB. Further characterization of the differences between the chloroplast genomes of the two Saccharum species was conducted using mVISTA, with S. spontaneum as a reference. The results showed that the differences between the two sugarcane chloroplast genomes primarily occur in the regions of conserved non-coding sequences, with the LSC and IRa regions exhibiting greater differences than the SSC and IRb regions (Fig. 2 C). The assembly of the chloroplast genomes, along with the availability of nuclear genomes [ 11 ] ( https://sugarcane.gxu.edu.cn/scdb/download ), has enabled the analysis of intracellular gene transfer in sugarcane."

Notably, the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum showed a high degree of similarity in both size and sequence to that of Khon Kaen 3, a commercial cultivar previously identified as having a maternal origin in a S. officinarum species [ 16 ] (Fig. S4). This finding illustrates the conservation of the mitochondrial genome within the species and validates the reliability of our assembly. The transfer of DNA fragments among nuclear and organellar genomes is a common event in plant evolution. Our results indicate that the mitochondrial genomes of S. spontaneum and S. officinarum encompass 59 and 52 MTPTs, respectively. These sequences cover 31,596 bp (5.58%) and 28,939 bp (6.50%) of the mitochondrial genomes in the two Saccharum species. Moreover, these MTPTs exhibit an uneven distribution within the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species (Fig. 3 A, Table S3 and S4 )."

The length of repeat sequences in S. spontaneum is more than five times that in S. officinarum , which likely contributes to the structural complexity and the presence of an additional circular molecule in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum. We conducted a further collinearity analysis of the S. officinarum and S. spontaneum mitochondrial genomes and analyzed the sequences unique to each species. The analysis shows that a 486,335 bp region of the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum has high collinearity with a 411,806 bp region of the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum (Fig. 3 B, Table S7 ). This can be attributed to the presence of multiple copies of repeat sequences in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum , resulting in good collinearity between multiple genomic regions of the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome and the same mitochondrial genomic region of S. officinarum (Fig. 3 B, Table S5 and Table S6 )."

Subsequently, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was utilized to finalize two co-dominant SSR markers. These markers showed distinct band size differences between the two Saccharum species and displayed only S. officinarum type bands in sugarcane cultivars, making them excellent for distinguishing sugarcane cytoplasmic types (Fig. S8 B-C).

We then used a hybrid assembly model to separately reconstruct and present the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species as molecular circles (Fig. 1 ). The lengths of the two molecular circles of S. officinarum were 300,828 bp and 144,727 bp, respectively, while the molecular sizes of the three circles of S. spontaneum were 299,685 bp, 156,834 bp and 109,235 bp, respectively. Finally, we mapped the Illumina reads and CCS reads to the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species. The average depth of the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome was 120.1x for CCS reads and 178.5x for Illumina reads. For the S. officinarum mitochondrial genome, the average depth was 110.6x for CCS reads and 260.7x for Illumina reads (Fig. S2 and Fig. S3 ). The sequencing depth statistics for each locus of the mitochondrial genome showed that we obtained two gap-free genomes, indicating the high quality of our assemblies."

In this study, we obtained the circular chloroplast genomes for both S. spontaneum (141,186 bp) and S. officinarum (141,180 bp) (Fig. 2 A). These chloroplast genomes exhibit typical quadripartite characteristics and demonstrate high conservation in organization and structure, featuring a large single-copy (LSC) region, a small single-copy (SSC) region, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions. Variations in chloroplast genome length and gene copy numbers commonly arise from expansions and contractions of IR regions. We compared the boundaries of IR and single-copy regions in the two Saccharum species (Fig. 2 B). The LSC and IR regions of the chloroplast genomes differed by only 20 bp and 7 bp, respectively."

For example, in S. officinarum , ndhH is located entirely in the SSC, whereas in S. spontaneum , ndhH has a 1 bp embedding in the IRb. Additionally, in S. spontaneum , ndhF is located in the JSA, while in S. officinarum , ndhF is located in the JSB. Further characterization of the differences between the chloroplast genomes of the two Saccharum species was conducted using mVISTA, with S. spontaneum as a reference. The results showed that the differences between the two sugarcane chloroplast genomes primarily occur in the regions of conserved non-coding sequences, with the LSC and IRa regions exhibiting greater differences than the SSC and IRb regions (Fig. 2 C). The assembly of the chloroplast genomes, along with the availability of nuclear genomes [ 11 ] ( https://sugarcane.gxu.edu.cn/scdb/download ), has enabled the analysis of intracellular gene transfer in sugarcane."

Notably, the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum showed a high degree of similarity in both size and sequence to that of Khon Kaen 3, a commercial cultivar previously identified as having a maternal origin in a S. officinarum species [ 16 ] (Fig. S4). This finding illustrates the conservation of the mitochondrial genome within the species and validates the reliability of our assembly. The transfer of DNA fragments among nuclear and organellar genomes is a common event in plant evolution. Our results indicate that the mitochondrial genomes of S. spontaneum and S. officinarum encompass 59 and 52 MTPTs, respectively. These sequences cover 31,596 bp (5.58%) and 28,939 bp (6.50%) of the mitochondrial genomes in the two Saccharum species. Moreover, these MTPTs exhibit an uneven distribution within the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species (Fig. 3 A, Table S3 and S4 )."

The length of repeat sequences in S. spontaneum is more than five times that in S. officinarum , which likely contributes to the structural complexity and the presence of an additional circular molecule in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum. We conducted a further collinearity analysis of the S. officinarum and S. spontaneum mitochondrial genomes and analyzed the sequences unique to each species. The analysis shows that a 486,335 bp region of the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum has high collinearity with a 411,806 bp region of the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum (Fig. 3 B, Table S7 ). This can be attributed to the presence of multiple copies of repeat sequences in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum , resulting in good collinearity between multiple genomic regions of the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome and the same mitochondrial genomic region of S. officinarum (Fig. 3 B, Table S5 and Table S6 )."

Homologous recombination mediated by repeat sequences is nearly universal in plant mitochondrial genomes [ 55 , 56 – 57 ].

Angiosperm mitochondrial genomes can incorporate DNA from various sources, including nuclear, plastid, viral, and bacterial origins, known as promiscuous DNA [ 59 , 60 – 61 ].

Furthermore, NUMTs are major components of the sequences unique to each sugarcane mitochondrial genome.

The molecular basis of CMS often involves frequent recombination or rearrangement of the mitochondrial genome, leading to the formation of abnormal chimeric genes. The products of these chimeric genes accumulate in the inner mitochondrial membrane, disrupting mitochondrial function and potentially triggering premature programmed cell death during male gametogenesis, resulting in male sterility [ 65 ]. The molecular mechanisms of CMS have been extensively studied in important crops such as rice and maize [ 66 , 67 ]. CMS-related genes typically carry coding fragments or flanking sequences of known mitochondrial genes and encode proteins with transmembrane domains [ 47 ]. Based on these criteria, we identified six chimeric ORFs in the mitochondrial genome of the pollen-sterile noble species S. officinarum (Table S10 ). Our findings indicate that ORF113 and ORF722 exhibit high levels of expression in the flowers of S. officinarum (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that these two genes may have specific roles in the floral developmental processes of this species. Expression of these two genes in yeast inhibited growth and ATP production (Fig. 5 B-D), which is consistent with previous studies on CMS-related genes [ 40 , 68 , 69 ]. Among these, ORF722 is a homolog of the reported rice male sterility gene orf133 [ 47 ]. However, ORF113 exhibits higher expression fold change in the flowers and a stronger inhibitory effect on yeast growth rate and ATP synthesis. Since ORF113 was identified as a chimeric gene for atp6 (Table S10 ), we hypothesize that ORF113 impairs the assembly of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This impairment could disturb the dynamic balance of ATP synthesis and reactive oxygen species bursts, leading to premature programmed cell death of the tapetal cells and pollen abortion, as has been observed in maize and cotton [ 40 , 67 ]. However, this hypothesis requires further experimental validation. Based on the above, we consider that ORF113 is a key candidate gene for male sterility in sugarcane."

As a result of this evolutionary pattern, plant mitochondrial genome size, structure and sequence arrangement show extensive variation among species [ 72 ], but are highly conserved within species [ 21 ]. SSRs are tandem repeat sequences with repeat units of 1–6 bases. SSRs are highly polymorphic, co-dominantly inherited, and effective markers for studying genetic diversity and identifying species [ 44 ]. Thus, developing SSR markers based on the mitochondrial genome could be a more efficient approach. In this study, we developed 12 polymorphic SSR markers based on the mitochondrial genomes of two Saccharum species (Fig. S8 A). These markers were screened using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and agarose gel electrophoresis, resulting in 2 co-dominant SSR markers present in both Saccharum species but with differences in product size (Fig. 6 , Fig. S8 B-C). Since almost all modern sugarcane cultivars are derived from “nobilization breeding”, the two co-dominant SSR markers we developed showed only S. officinarum type bands in all 10 sugarcane cultivars tested (Fig. 6 , Fig. S8 B-C). This demonstrates that the SSR molecular markers we developed can accurately differentiate the cytoplasmic types of the two Saccharum species, with the advantages of convenient operation and precise identification."

The molecular basis of CMS often involves frequent recombination or rearrangement of the mitochondrial genome, leading to the formation of abnormal chimeric genes. The products of these chimeric genes accumulate in the inner mitochondrial membrane, disrupting mitochondrial function and potentially triggering premature programmed cell death during male gametogenesis, resulting in male sterility [ 65 ]. The molecular mechanisms of CMS have been extensively studied in important crops such as rice and maize [ 66 , 67 ]. CMS-related genes typically carry coding fragments or flanking sequences of known mitochondrial genes and encode proteins with transmembrane domains [ 47 ]. Based on these criteria, we identified six chimeric ORFs in the mitochondrial genome of the pollen-sterile noble species S. officinarum (Table S10 ). Our findings indicate that ORF113 and ORF722 exhibit high levels of expression in the flowers of S. officinarum (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that these two genes may have specific roles in the floral developmental processes of this species. Expression of these two genes in yeast inhibited growth and ATP production (Fig. 5 B-D), which is consistent with previous studies on CMS-related genes [ 40 , 68 , 69 ]. Among these, ORF722 is a homolog of the reported rice male sterility gene orf133 [ 47 ]. However, ORF113 exhibits higher expression fold change in the flowers and a stronger inhibitory effect on yeast growth rate and ATP synthesis. Since ORF113 was identified as a chimeric gene for atp6 (Table S10 ), we hypothesize that ORF113 impairs the assembly of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This impairment could disturb the dynamic balance of ATP synthesis and reactive oxygen species bursts, leading to premature programmed cell death of the tapetal cells and pollen abortion, as has been observed in maize and cotton [ 40 , 67 ]. However, this hypothesis requires further experimental validation. Based on the above, we consider that ORF113 is a key candidate gene for male sterility in sugarcane."

    "full_text": "Introduction Sugarcane, a C 4 plant belonging to the botanical family Gramineae (Poaceae), is extensively cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its high photosynthetic efficiency, it is one of the most productive field crops [ 1 ]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, sugarcane supplies 80% of the world’s sugar and 40% of its bioethanol, with a direct agro-economic value of $96 billion, establishing it as a vital sugar and energy crop (FAO, 2022). This success is attributed to the utilization of wild sugarcane germplasm and the success of sexual cross-breeding, resulting in numerous superior varieties. The nobilization theory, which underpins the exploitation of wild sugarcane germplasm, has significantly advanced the breeding process [ 2 ]. Modern cultivated sugarcane is produced through a process known as nobilization breeding. This process involves crossing two founding species, Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum spontaneum . The progeny from this initial cross is then further crossed with S. officinarum to develop the modern cultivars [ 3 ]. To obtain sugarcane varieties with excellent comprehensive traits, high sugar and high yield genes derived from S. officinarum could be enriched through hybridization and backcross. Meanwhile, high resistance and stress tolerance of S. spontaneum could also be infiltrated during the process of nobilization [ 2 ]. In this process, “noble species” S. officinarum with male sterile can only serve as the female parent, resulting in the narrow genetic basis for modern sugarcane cultivars [ 4 , 5 ]. The organelles in eukaryotic cells are believed to have originated from ancient endosymbiotic events. Their genomes are considered remnants of ancient eubacteria, independent of the nuclear genome, and typically exhibit maternal inheritance [ 6 , 7 ]. Mitochondria, as semiautonomous organelles in eukaryotic cells, provide essential energy for various life activities and are widely used in studies on species origin, genetic diversity, and phylogenetics [ 8 , 9 – 10 ]. The rapid development of sequencing and genome assembly technologies, has gradually resolved the complex polyploid genomes of Saccharum species. This progress has greatly facilitated research in gene family identification, genetic mapping, population genetics, and genome evolution analysis in sugarcane [ 1 , 11 , 12 – 13 ]. However, the mitochondrial genomes of sugarcane, particularly S. spontaneum , have not been comprehensively and systematically characterized [ 14 , 15 – 16 ]. According to the NCBI database, 18,218 mitochondrial genomes have been published, but only 465 mitochondrial genomes from flowering plants (Angiosperm) have been sequenced ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/organelle/ , accessed on September 10, 2024). This limited number is primarily due to the complex size and structural characteristics of plant mitochondrial genomes compared to those of animals [ 17 , 18 ]. Plant mitochondrial genomes are known to integrate DNA from various sources through intracellular and horizontal transfer, resulting in significant variation among species [ 9 , 19 ]. Despite this variation, plant mitochondrial genomes exhibit much lower mutation rates than their nuclear and chloroplast counterparts, making them highly conserved within a species and useful for interspecific marker development [ 20 , 21 ]. Additionally, plant mitochondrial genomes contain complex non-coding and repeated regions, which include many chimeric genes and open reading frames ( ORFs ), some of which may contribute to cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) [ 22 , 23 ]. Despite these insights, the molecular mechanisms underlying CMS in sugarcane remain unresolved. To investigate the molecular basis of male sterility in sugarcane, this study sequenced and assembled the complete mitochondrial genomes of S. spontaneum and S. officinarum , examining their genomic structures. Further, we identified potentially CMS-related ORF in sugarcane and developed two co-dominant simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers sufficient to distinguish the cytoplasmic types between S. officinarum and S. spontaneum . These findings contribute to understanding the CMS mechanism in sugarcane, and hold theoretical value for broadening the genetic base and facilitating sexual hybrid breeding in sugarcane. Materials and methods Plant materials, DNA extraction and sequencing Leaves were collected from seedlings of S. spontaneum Np-X and S. officinarum B48, which were grown in a greenhouse at 25–30 °C with 14 h of light per day. Genomic DNA was extracted from these leaves using the modified CTAB method [ 24 ]. This DNA was then used to construct Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) libraries and Illumina short-read libraries, which were subsequently sequenced on the PacBio Sequel and Illumina HiSeq platforms, respectively. Assembly and annotation of organelle genomes First, we assembled the chloroplast genome from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data using GetOrganelle with default parameters [ 25 ]. To assemble the mitochondrial genome, we employed a multi-step strategy. The CCS reads were initially assembled into contigs using NextDenovo [ 26 ]. Mitochondrial contigs were then identified in each draft assembly using the BLASTN program [ 27 ] with the reference mitochondrial genome of the sugarcane cultivar Khon Kaen 3 (accession numbers: LC107874 and LC107875). The WGS data were assembled into a uniting graph with GetOrganelle. This graph-based assembly was visualized using Bandage software [ 28 ] and manually refined by removing nodes derived from chloroplast and nuclear DNA. Finally, the long-read results from NextDenovo were utilized to eliminate interference from repeat regions, ensuring the most accurate mitochondrial genome structure possible. The chloroplast genome was annotated using CPGAVAS2 [ 29 ]. The two mitochondrial genomes were annotated using GeSeq [ 30 ], with the reference mitochondrial genome of the sugarcane cultivar (accession numbers: LC107874 and LC107875). rRNAs and tRNAs were annotated using BLASTN [ 27 ] and tRNAscan [ 31 ], respectively. Subsequently, the genome map of mitochondrial genomes was visualized using OGDRAW [ 32 ]. Annotations of organelle genomes were manually checked and improved with Apollo [ 33 ]. IRscope [ 34 ] and mVISTA [ 35 ] were used to analyze and visualize the IR boundary and genomic structures among two chloroplast genomes sequenced in this study, respectively. Analysis of collinearity and intracellular gene transfer The dot plots of the mitochondrial genomes of S. officinarum B48 and the sugarcane cultivar Khon Kaen 3 were generated using Gepard [ 36 ]. Homologous sequences between the mitochondrial genomes of S. officinarum and S. spontaneum were detected using the BLASTN program [ 27 ] with the following parameters: e-value of 1e-5, word size of 7, and identity > 80%. Homologous sequences with a length of more than 500 bp were retained as conservative collinear blocks. The outcomes were visualized using LINKVIEW2 ( https://github.com/YangJian-shun/LINKVIEW2 ). To investigate homologous sequences that might be transferred among the organelles, mitochondrial plastid sequences (MTPTs) and nuclear-mitochondrial segments (NUMTs) were identified by comparing the mitochondrial genome with the chloroplast genome or nuclear genome using BLASTN with an e-value cut-off of 1e-6 and a word size of 7. Phylogenetic analysis For phylogenetic analysis, mitochondrial genome files of an additional 17 selected species were downloaded from the NCBI database (the accession numbers are listed in Table S1 ). Multiple alignments of the 13 common conserved protein-coding genes ( atp1 , atp4 , atp8 , ccmB , ccmC , cox1 , cox2 , matR , mttB , nad2 , nad6 , nad7 , and nad9 ) from these species were performed using MAFFT [ 37 ]. Then, PhyloSuite software [ 38 ] was then used to trim and concatenate the alignment files. The IQ-TREE function in PhyloSuite was utilized to construct maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees using the “GTR + G + I” model with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The phylogenetic tree was displayed using the iTOL website tool ( https://itol.embl.de/ ). Identification of candidate CMS-associated ORFs The ORFs of the S. officinarum B48 mitochondrial genome were identified using ORF Finder ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html ) with a threshold of at least 70 amino acids. This threshold was chosen because the shortest mitochondrial peptide known to cause CMS in rice is ORF79, which consists of 79 amino acids [ 39 ]. Two key criteria for screening CMS-related genes are the presence of mitochondrial chimeric ORFs and transmembrane domains. Transmembrane domains in each protein encoded by the ORFs were predicted using DeepTMHMM ( https://dtu.bio-lib.com/DeepTM-HMM ). Expression of six candidate ORFs in yeast cells The full-length coding sequences of each chimeric ORF ( ORF113 , ORF712 , ORF722 , ORF797 , ORF957 , and ORF1788 ) were amplified using PCR from the cDNA of S. officinarum B48. The PCR products were then cloned into pYES2 that had been predigested with Kpn I and EcoR I. The resulting expression plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1. Positive yeast transformants were selected on SD-ura plates (Synthetic Dextrose Minimal Medium without Uracil), and yeast cells were cultured on SGR-ura plates (synthetic medium lacking uracil and containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose) to induce protein expression. The viability of transgenic yeast expressing the chimeric ORF was assessed based on growth density. Overnight cultures of yeast grown in SGR-ura and YPDA (Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose Medium with Adenine) liquid medium at 30 °C with shaking (220 rpm) were adjusted to appropriate concentrations (OD 600 of 0.4 in SGR-ura liquid medium, OD 600 of 0.1 in YPDA liquid medium). Tenfold serial dilutions were then spotted onto SGR-ura and SD-ura agar plates, with each spot containing 5 µl of yeast culture. These plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The remaining yeast cultures were adjusted to an OD 600 of 0.3 and continued to be cultured in SGR-ura and YPDA liquid media at 30 °C with shaking (220 rpm), with OD 600 monitored over time. Detection of ATP content in yeast cells Measurements of ATP content in yeast cells were performed following the methods previously published [ 40 ]. After overnight culture in SGR-ura or YPDA liquid medium, the recombinant cells were collected and resuspended in Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0, 1 mmol L − 1 ). The ATP content was determined using the luciferin-luciferase method with the Enhanced ATP Assay Kit (S0027, Beyotime, Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For this assay, 2 ml of yeast cells were used. Luminous intensity was measured immediately using a LumiPro Single Tube Luminometer (Atila Biosystems Inc, USA), and the results were calculated against a standard curve of serial dilutions of ATP standard solutions. RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis The second leaves and unopened florets of S. spontaneum (YN83-179) and S. officinarum (B48) at the mature stage were collected, with three biological replicates for each species. These plant tissues were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from the sugarcane tissues using the Plant RNA Kit (R6827-01, Omega Bio-tek, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted RNA was subsequently used for cDNA synthesis using the StarScript II First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit with gDNA Remover (A224, GenStar, Beijing, China). qRT-PCR was performed as previously described [ 41 ], with Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) and 25S ribosomal RNA (25S rRNA) serving as internal reference genes. The relative gene expression levels were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt method [ 42 ]. Table S2 lists all the primers used in this study. Analysis of repeat sequences Paired repeat sequences were detected using BLASTN program with an e-value cut-off of 1e-5. SSRs were identified using the Microsatellite identification tool [ 43 ]. The motif sizes for one- to six-nucleotide SSRs were set to 10, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 4, respectively. SSR marker primers were developed and validated as previously described [ 44 ]. Results Characteristics of the mitochondrial genomes of S. spontaneum and S. officinarum For the two sugarcane founding species, we adopted an identical assembly strategy. Initially, we obtained two complex assembly graphs using Illumina-based assembly (Fig. S1 ). We then used a hybrid assembly model to separately reconstruct and present the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species as molecular circles (Fig. 1 ). The lengths of the two molecular circles of S. officinarum were 300,828 bp and 144,727 bp, respectively, while the molecular sizes of the three circles of S. spontaneum were 299,685 bp, 156,834 bp and 109,235 bp, respectively. Finally, we mapped the Illumina reads and CCS reads to the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species. The average depth of the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome was 120.1x for CCS reads and 178.5x for Illumina reads. For the S. officinarum mitochondrial genome, the average depth was 110.6x for CCS reads and 260.7x for Illumina reads (Fig. S2 and Fig. S3 ). The sequencing depth statistics for each locus of the mitochondrial genome showed that we obtained two gap-free genomes, indicating the high quality of our assemblies.

The gray circles indicate GC content, and the trans-shear genes nad1 , nad2 , nad5 , etc. are shown as multiple exons We annotated the two mitochondrial genomes, with the classification of genes detailed in Tables 1 and 2 . Both Saccharum species contained 24 unique core genes and 6 unique variable genes, with differences only in gene copy numbers. The core genes included five ATP synthase genes ( atp1 , atp4 , atp6 , atp8 and atp9 ), four cytochrome C biogenesis genes ( ccmB , ccmC , ccmFc and ccmFn ), one ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase gene ( cob ), three cytochrome C oxidase genes ( cox1 , cox2 and cox3 ), nine NADH dehydrogenase genes ( nad1 , nad2 , nad3 , nad4 , nad4L , nad5 , nad6 , nad7 and nad9 ), a transport membrane protein gene ( mttB ), and a maturase gene ( matR ). The variable genes consisted of one large subunit ribosomal protein gene ( rpl16 ) and five small subunit ribosomal protein genes ( rps1 , rps3 , rps4 , rps12 , and rps13 ). No succinate dehydrogenase genes were identified. Additionally, three rRNA genes and 14 tRNA genes were annotated in the mitochondrial genomes of both Saccharum species.

In this study, we obtained the circular chloroplast genomes for both S. spontaneum (141,186 bp) and S. officinarum (141,180 bp) (Fig. 2 A). These chloroplast genomes exhibit typical quadripartite characteristics and demonstrate high conservation in organization and structure, featuring a large single-copy (LSC) region, a small single-copy (SSC) region, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions. Variations in chloroplast genome length and gene copy numbers commonly arise from expansions and contractions of IR regions. We compared the boundaries of IR and single-copy regions in the two Saccharum species (Fig. 2 B). The LSC and IR regions of the chloroplast genomes differed by only 20 bp and 7 bp, respectively. Our analysis revealed conservation in the junction sites of LSC/IRb region (JLB) and the junction sites of IRa/LSC region (JLA), while variability was observed in the junction sites of SSC/IRb region (JSB) and the junction sites of SSC/IRa region (JSA). For example, in S. officinarum , ndhH is located entirely in the SSC, whereas in S. spontaneum , ndhH has a 1 bp embedding in the IRb. Additionally, in S. spontaneum , ndhF is located in the JSA, while in S. officinarum , ndhF is located in the JSB. Further characterization of the differences between the chloroplast genomes of the two Saccharum species was conducted using mVISTA, with S. spontaneum as a reference. The results showed that the differences between the two sugarcane chloroplast genomes primarily occur in the regions of conserved non-coding sequences, with the LSC and IRa regions exhibiting greater differences than the SSC and IRb regions (Fig. 2 C). The assembly of the chloroplast genomes, along with the availability of nuclear genomes [ 11 ] ( https://sugarcane.gxu.edu.cn/scdb/download ), has enabled the analysis of intracellular gene transfer in sugarcane.

LSC: large single-copy region, IR: inverted repeat region, SSC: small single-copy region, JLB: junction sites of LSC/IRb region, JSB: junction sites of SSC/IRb region, JSA: junction sites of SSC/IRa region, JLA: junction sites of IRa/LSC region Collinearity and variations of mitochondrial genomes in two Saccharum species Our assembly results unveiled significant structural differences in the mitochondrial genome of the two Saccharum species, including the presence of an additional molecular circle and size disparities of approximately 120 kb (Fig. 1 ). Notably, the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum showed a high degree of similarity in both size and sequence to that of Khon Kaen 3, a commercial cultivar previously identified as having a maternal origin in a S. officinarum species [ 16 ] (Fig. S4). This finding illustrates the conservation of the mitochondrial genome within the species and validates the reliability of our assembly. The transfer of DNA fragments among nuclear and organellar genomes is a common event in plant evolution. Our results indicate that the mitochondrial genomes of S. spontaneum and S. officinarum encompass 59 and 52 MTPTs, respectively. These sequences cover 31,596 bp (5.58%) and 28,939 bp (6.50%) of the mitochondrial genomes in the two Saccharum species. Moreover, these MTPTs exhibit an uneven distribution within the mitochondrial genomes of the two Saccharum species (Fig. 3 A, Table S3 and S4 ). Previous studies have reported that repeat sequences can mediate various degrees of mitochondrial genome rearrangement [ 45 , 46 ]. In this study, we detected 244 pairs of repeat sequences in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum and 124 pairs in that of S. officinarum , which account for 49.28% (278,828 bp) and 12.34% (54,980 bp) of their mitochondrial genomes, respectively (Table S5 and S6 ). The length of repeat sequences in S. spontaneum is more than five times that in S. officinarum , which likely contributes to the structural complexity and the presence of an additional circular molecule in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum. We conducted a further collinearity analysis of the S. officinarum and S. spontaneum mitochondrial genomes and analyzed the sequences unique to each species. The analysis shows that a 486,335 bp region of the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum has high collinearity with a 411,806 bp region of the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum (Fig. 3 B, Table S7 ). This can be attributed to the presence of multiple copies of repeat sequences in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum , resulting in good collinearity between multiple genomic regions of the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome and the same mitochondrial genomic region of S. officinarum (Fig. 3 B, Table S5 and Table S6 ). Furthermore, our results indicate that NUMTs are a major component of the sequences unique to each sugarcane mitochondrial genome (Fig. 3 B, Table S8 and Table S9 ). In the unique mitochondrial genome region of S. spontaneum (74.53 kb), we identified 42 NUMTs covering a total of 68.20 kb. In contrast, in the unique mitochondrial genome region of S. officinarum (45.68 kb), we identified only 20 NUMTs covering a total of 33.10 kb. We then randomly selected six regions containing NUMTs unique to each sugarcane mitochondrial genome for PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 3 B). The PCR products showed differences between the two Saccharum species, and the sequences obtained from Sanger sequencing were fully aligned with the mitochondrial genome reference sequences (Fig. 3 C and Fig. S5 ). This confirms the presence of the unique sequences and the authenticity of the NUMTs.

The full uncropped gel image is shown in Fig. S9 A Phylogenetic analysis of plant species based on shared mitochondrial genes Phylogenetic analysis was performed of 1 basal angiosperm (ANA grade, which includes Amborellales, Nymphaeales and Austrobaileyales), 6 monocotyledonous plants and 12 dicotyledonous plants (Table S1 ). Using Nymphaea colorata as the outgroup and based on shared conserved protein-coding genes, we obtained identical and well-supported tree topologies, with most nodes having bootstrap support values over 75% (Fig. 4 ). The results showed that S. spontaneum , S. officinarum , and S. cultivar clustered into one branch, indicating their close relationship. Additionally, the phylogenetic tree strongly supported the close phylogenetic relationship between sugarcane and Sorghum bicolor , with 100% bootstrap support. The taxa order in the phylogenetic tree was consistent with the evolutionary relationships of these species, demonstrating the consistency between traditional taxonomy and molecular classification. Fig. 4 Maximum likelihood (ML) tree constructed based on common protein coding genes, bootstrapping 1000 repeats Mining of CMS-related ORFs in S. officinarum The mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum , which is male sterile, was screened for specific ORFs encoding more than 70 amino acids with transmembrane domains, and 30 such ORFs were identified (Table S10 ). We then investigated whether these ORFs were chimerized with known mitochondrial genes, and observed chimeric structures in ORF712 , ORF722 , ORF957 , ORF1788 , ORF113 , and ORF797 . Specifically, ORF712 is partially similar to nad6 ; ORF722 is homologous to Oryza rufipogon orf133 , a CMS-associated gene of RT98-CMS [ 47 ]; ORF957 has 18 additional amino acids at the N-terminus compared to nad6 ; ORF1788 has 24 additional amino acids at the N-terminus compared to nad5 ; ORF113 is identified as atp6 , but differs significantly in sequence from other species; and ORF797 has 19 additional amino acids at the C-terminus compared to nad6 . We further investigated the expression levels of these ORFs in the leaves and flowers of two Saccharum species. The expression fold change of each ORF in flowers compared to leaves showed significant differences between the two Saccharum species ( t -tests, 0.63 ≤ fold change ≤ 7.80, p -value < 0.0018, Fig. 5 A). Specifically, ORF113 , ORF722 , ORF797 , and ORF957 were found to have higher expression fold change in the flowers of S. officinarum than in those of S. spontaneum . Among these four ORFs , ORF113 exhibited the highest expression fold change in the flowers of S. officinarum (fold change is 7.80). Fig. 5 The expression fold change of six chimeric ORFs in sugarcane flowers compared to leaves ( A ), and the effect of chimeric ORFs expression on growth ( B , C ) and ATP production ( D ) in yeast. “ Ss ” suffix represent S. spontaneum , “ So ” suffix represent S. officinarum , “Glu” represent YPDA medium with glucose as the carbon source, and “Gal” represent SGR/-ura medium with galactose as the carbon source Expression of ORF113 and ORF722 inhibits the growth and ATP production of yeast Since many CMS proteins have been reported as toxic to yeast and inhibitory to its growth, we ectopically expressed six candidate ORFs associated with CMS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. S6 A). We successfully obtained transformants for each ORF , which were verified by PCR (Fig. S6 B). In cell growth and viability tests, transgenic yeast expressing either pYES2 or candidate ORFs exhibited similar viability on YPDA glucose-rich media (Fig. S7 ). However, on inducing media plates (SGR/-Ura, with galactose as the carbon source), the cell viability of ORF113 , ORF722 , and ORF1788 transformants was reduced compared to those expressing pYES2 after induced protein expression (Fig. 5 B). This growth inhibition was also observed in SGR/-Ura liquid medium for transgenic yeast expressing ORF113 , ORF722 , and ORF1788 (Fig. 5 C), with ORF113 causing the most significant inhibition (Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, p -value < 0.0001). Furthermore, the ATP content in yeast cells transformed with ORF113 , ORF722 , and ORF797 was significantly reduced following galactose induction compared to yeast cells transformed with pYES2 (t-tests, p -value < 0.0001, Fig. 5 D). Development and validation of SSR markers Based on the mitochondrial genomes, we developed SSR markers from the repetitive motifs and their 150 bp flanking sequences. We obtained 30 and 35 candidate SSR markers and designed primers for S. spontaneum and S. officinarum , respectively (Table S11 and S12 ). Among these, 15 pairs of primer sequences were identical between the two Saccharum species, and 12 of these primer pairs were predicted to have the same product size in the two Saccharum species and were discarded in further analysis. Using agarose gel electrophoresis, we found that the 12 SSR markers exhibited differences in product size between the two Saccharum species (Fig. S8 A). Subsequently, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was utilized to finalize two co-dominant SSR markers. These markers showed distinct band size differences between the two Saccharum species and displayed only S. officinarum type bands in sugarcane cultivars, making them excellent for distinguishing sugarcane cytoplasmic types (Fig. S8 B-C). Moreover, these two markers perform consistently in agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6 ), demonstrating the convenience and accuracy of applying these markers for identifying sugarcane cytoplasmic types. Fig. 6 Two co-dominant SSR markers verification profiles of 24 accessions from Saccharum detected using agarose gel electrophoresis. 1–8 channels are S. officinarum (B48, Crystalina, LA-purple, NC20, KARA KARA WA, Cana Blanca, Keong Java, and Manjar), 9–16 are S. spontaneum (Np-X, SES-208, 2013-8, 2015-68, FJ79-II-9, HN2012-124, Laos2, and YN82-25), 17–24 are sugarcane cultivars (Co290, Co213, CZ-2, POJ-2878, Co281, ROC22, Co419, and F134). The full uncropped gel image is shown in Fig. S9 B Discussion Plant mitochondria convert biomass energy into chemical energy through phosphorylation, providing essential energy for various life activities. They are involved in cell differentiation, cell division, apoptosis, and CMS [ 48 , 49 – 50 ]. Thus, mitochondria play a crucial role in plant growth and development. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the mitochondrial genomes of S. spontaneum and S. officinarum into three (299,685 bp, 156,834 bp, and 109,235 bp) and two (300,828 bp and 144,727 bp) circular molecules, respectively. These assemblies will serve as valuable resources for further studies on the inheritance, evolution, and function of sugarcane mitochondria. The proportions of repeat sequences are the primary cause of structure and size variations in the mitochondrial genome between two Saccharum founding species In this study, we reported the complete mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum , which is 120,199 bp longer and contains one more circular molecule than that of S. officinarum . Despite these differences, both mitochondrial genomes encode the same genes, differing only in gene copy number (Fig. 1 ; Table 1 , and Table 2 ). The mitochondrial genome assembly of S. officinarum is similar in size and structure to the previously reported mitochondrial genome of sugarcane cultivars identified as having a maternal origin in a S. officinarum species (Fig. S4 ) [ 14 , 15 – 16 ]. This suggests that the mitochondrial genomes within the sugarcane genus are highly conserved at the species level but exhibit major variations in size, composition, and structure among different species, which is consistent with previous studies [ 16 , 51 ]. The considerable variation among angiosperm mitochondrial genomes is attributed to the relative proportions of repeat sequences, intergenic spacers, and foreign sequences [ 52 , 53 – 54 ]. We found that the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum contains more than five times the length of repeat sequences compared to S. officinarum , resulting in S. spontaneum having 74.53 kb more sequences (Fig. 3 B, Tables S5-S7). Homologous recombination mediated by repeat sequences is nearly universal in plant mitochondrial genomes [ 55 , 56 – 57 ]. Thus, we hypothesize that the high proportion of repeat sequences is the cause of the complex genome structure and large genome size in the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum , as supported by previous studies [ 58 ]. Angiosperm mitochondrial genomes can incorporate DNA from various sources, including nuclear, plastid, viral, and bacterial origins, known as promiscuous DNA [ 59 , 60 – 61 ]. In this study, we found that the mitochondrial genome of sugarcane also integrates chloroplast and nuclear DNA, which is consistent with findings in Arabidopsis and cucumber [ 53 , 60 ]. The mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum contains 5.58% chloroplast DNA (31.6 kb) (Fig. 3 A, Table S3 ), while the mitochondrial genome of S. officinarum contains 6.50% chloroplast DNA (28.9 kb) (Fig. 3 A, Table S4 ). It is worth noting that we found NUMTs to be the primary cause of the differences between the two sugarcane mitochondrial genome sequences. Specifically, 85.91% of the sequences unique to the S. spontaneum mitochondrial genome (68.20 kb) and 98.22% of the sequences unique to the S. officinarum mitochondrial genome (33.10 kb) were identified as NUMTs (Fig. 3 B, Table S8 and Table S9 ). In summary, we hypothesize that the high proportion of repeat sequences is the reason for the more complex structure of the mitochondrial genome in S. spontaneum . The size differences (120.20 kb) between the two sugarcane mitochondrial genomes are mainly attributed to repeat sequences (74.53 kb, 62.00%), NUMTs (35.10 kb, 29.20%), and MTPTs (2.66 kb, 2.21%). Furthermore, NUMTs are major components of the sequences unique to each sugarcane mitochondrial genome. This is consistent with the perspective that the novelty of plant mitochondrial sequences is possibly due to large repeats and rearrangements, the influx of sequences from nuclear and chloroplast genomes, and the horizontal transfer of sequences from other plant mitochondria [ 58 , 62 , 63 ]. ORF113 is a key candidate CMS-related gene in sugarcane CMS is a ubiquitous maternally inherited trait in crop plants [ 64 ]. The molecular basis of CMS often involves frequent recombination or rearrangement of the mitochondrial genome, leading to the formation of abnormal chimeric genes. The products of these chimeric genes accumulate in the inner mitochondrial membrane, disrupting mitochondrial function and potentially triggering premature programmed cell death during male gametogenesis, resulting in male sterility [ 65 ]. The molecular mechanisms of CMS have been extensively studied in important crops such as rice and maize [ 66 , 67 ]. CMS-related genes typically carry coding fragments or flanking sequences of known mitochondrial genes and encode proteins with transmembrane domains [ 47 ]. Based on these criteria, we identified six chimeric ORFs in the mitochondrial genome of the pollen-sterile noble species S. officinarum (Table S10 ). Our findings indicate that ORF113 and ORF722 exhibit high levels of expression in the flowers of S. officinarum (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that these two genes may have specific roles in the floral developmental processes of this species. Expression of these two genes in yeast inhibited growth and ATP production (Fig. 5 B-D), which is consistent with previous studies on CMS-related genes [ 40 , 68 , 69 ]. Among these, ORF722 is a homolog of the reported rice male sterility gene orf133 [ 47 ]. However, ORF113 exhibits higher expression fold change in the flowers and a stronger inhibitory effect on yeast growth rate and ATP synthesis. Since ORF113 was identified as a chimeric gene for atp6 (Table S10 ), we hypothesize that ORF113 impairs the assembly of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This impairment could disturb the dynamic balance of ATP synthesis and reactive oxygen species bursts, leading to premature programmed cell death of the tapetal cells and pollen abortion, as has been observed in maize and cotton [ 40 , 67 ]. However, this hypothesis requires further experimental validation. Based on the above, we consider that ORF113 is a key candidate gene for male sterility in sugarcane. Interspecies-specific mitochondrial SSR markers are effective in distinguishing cytoplasmic types of two sugarcane founding species Plant mitochondrial genomes have undergone rapid and dramatic structural changes since the initial endosymbiotic events, while exhibiting a lower mutation rate than other intracellular genomes [ 21 , 70 , 71 ]. As a result of this evolutionary pattern, plant mitochondrial genome size, structure and sequence arrangement show extensive variation among species [ 72 ], but are highly conserved within species [ 21 ]. SSRs are tandem repeat sequences with repeat units of 1–6 bases. SSRs are highly polymorphic, co-dominantly inherited, and effective markers for studying genetic diversity and identifying species [ 44 ]. Thus, developing SSR markers based on the mitochondrial genome could be a more efficient approach. In this study, we developed 12 polymorphic SSR markers based on the mitochondrial genomes of two Saccharum species (Fig. S8 A). These markers were screened using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and agarose gel electrophoresis, resulting in 2 co-dominant SSR markers present in both Saccharum species but with differences in product size (Fig. 6 , Fig. S8 B-C). Since almost all modern sugarcane cultivars are derived from “nobilization breeding”, the two co-dominant SSR markers we developed showed only S. officinarum type bands in all 10 sugarcane cultivars tested (Fig. 6 , Fig. S8 B-C). This demonstrates that the SSR molecular markers we developed can accurately differentiate the cytoplasmic types of the two Saccharum species, with the advantages of convenient operation and precise identification. Nobilization breeding can rapidly increase the proportion of the S. officinarum bloodline in hybrid progeny and effectively retain high yield and high sugar genes. This is due to the unique chromosome 2n + n mode of inheritance (i.e., S. officinarum is transmitted by 2n gametes, while S. spontaneum or S. cultivars are transmitted by n gametes). Using typical S. officinarum materials as the maternal parent in crossbreeding can effectively promote the process of sugarcane nobilization [ 2 , 73 ]. Therefore, the SSRs developed in this study can serve not only for genetic analysis, but also for sugarcane variety identification, providing a theoretical basis for parental selection in sugarcane crossbreeding. Conclusion In this study, we assembled and compared the mitochondrial genomes of two founding parents used in the cross-breeding of modern sugarcane cultivars. Our results showed that, while the mitochondrial genomes of S. spontaneum and S. officinarum contain the same protein-coding genes, there are substantial differences in genome size and structure. Specifically, the mitochondrial genome of S. spontaneum is 120,199 bp larger and contains an additional circular molecule compared to S. officinarum . Our analysis revealed that the proportion of repeat sequences is the primary factor contributing to the variations in mitochondrial genome structure and size between the two Saccharum species, and that the sequence differences between the two species are mainly attributed to NUMTs. We also investigated the CMS of sugarcane and hypothesized that ORF113 causes sugarcane pollen sterility by impairing the assembly of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex and ATP production. This hypothesis, along with the molecular mechanism by which ORF113 exerts its function, requires further experimentally verified and explored. Furthermore, we developed two SSR markers based on the sugarcane mitochondrial genome that can effectively distinguish the cytoplasmic types of the two Saccharum species. These findings provide valuable information for evolutionary studies, variety identification, and analysis of the molecular basis of CMS in sugarcane."
