    "full_text": "Plant growth is directly influenced by biotic and abiotic stress factors resulting from environmental changes. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have become a crucial area of research aimed at addressing these challenges. However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how PGPR impacts the microenvironments surrounding plant roots. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the effects of two distinct PGPR strains, Streptomyces griseorubiginosus BTU6 (known for its resistance to smut disease) and S. chartreusis WZS021, on sugarcane roots. Additionally, we compare the resultant modifications in the physicochemical characteristics of the rhizospheric soil and root architecture. The results reveal that following the inoculation of S. chartreusis WZS021, there was a significant increase in the active chemicals associated with nitrogen metabolism in sugarcane roots. This enhancement led to a substantial enrichment of nitrogen-cycling microbes like Pseudomonas and Gemmatimona . This finding supports earlier research indicating that S. chartreusis WZS021 enhances sugarcane's capacity to utilize nitrogen effectively. Furthermore, after treatment with S. chartreusis , Aspergillus became the predominant strain among endophytic fungi, resulting in alterations to their community structure that conferred drought resistance. In contrast, the relative abundance of Xanthomonas in the root environment decreased following inoculation with S. griseorubiginosus . Instead, Gemmatimona became more prevalent, creating a favorable environment for plants to bolster their resistance against disease. Notably, inoculations with S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 led to substantial changes in the chemical composition, enzymatic activity, and microbial community composition in the soil surrounding sugarcane roots. However, there were distinct differences in the specific alterations induced by each strain. These findings enhance plant resilience to stress by shedding light on PGPR-mediated modifications in root microenvironments."

          "A holobiont is a symbiotic organism created due to the coevolution of plant populations and microbial populations over a protracted period. In this intricate relationship, the host plant and the associated microbial community work together as an integrated unit to affect the plant's overall structure. These components work together to create a solid connection that connects these constituents' ecological dynamics and evolutionary pathways ( Trivedi et al., 2020 ). The soil microbiota dominates the entire biological cycle ( Janvier et al., 2007 ). Microorganisms are selected and enriched by the plant root system to form the rhizosphere microbiome ( Hiruma et al., 2016; Durán et al., 2018 ), which accompanies plants throughout their growth cycle and participates in critical physiological processes such as growth and development, nutrient uptake, and disease and stress resistance ( Castrillo et al., 2017; Van Deynze et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019 ). High-throughput sequencing is a valuable tool for revealing the diversity and composition of microorganisms in various soil ecosystems ( Thompson et al., 2017 ).",
          "While the significance of the rhizosphere and its microbial residents in the well-being and development of plants has been acknowledged, there exists a distinct void in knowledge concerning the specific mechanisms that underlie the interaction between microbes that promote plant growth and the microenvironment of the roots. Furthermore, the precise function of Streptomyces species, particularly those that promote plant growth, in augmenting plant development and the ability to withstand stress within this framework, remains to be fully comprehended. Microbial inoculants are biological products used in agriculture with microbial life activities and products that can significantly improve soil fertility ( Berg et al., 2021 ). Enhancing the activity and population of beneficial microbiota is essential for improving the physicochemical properties and nutrients of the soil, and microbial fertilizers can stimulate the life activity of soil microorganisms when applied to the soil ( Arif et al., 2020 ). The life activity of beneficial microorganisms converts nutrients into active components in the soil that can be absorbed and used by the plant body, thereby extending the retention time of fertilization ( Cardinale et al., 2006; Enwall et al., 2007 ).",
          "Complex interactions between plants and soil microorganisms occur in the rhizosphere. The rhizosphere is directly influenced by plant roots and secretions and is an important site for microbial colonization and activity: on the one hand, plants provide substrates and signaling molecules for the growth of microbes in the rhizosphere through root secretions ( Rajniak et al., 2018; Stringlis et al., 2018 ); on the other hand, rhizospheric microbes increase the effectiveness of rhizosphere nutrient uptake ( Jamil et al., 2022 ) and enhance plant immunity to biotic and abiotic stresses ( Saeed et al., 2021; Chamkhi et al., 2022 ). Soil microorganisms are involved in soil organic matter (OM) decomposition and nutrient cycling and play a key role in maintaining the function and sustainability of soil ecosystems and soil science management ( Lou et al., 2011 ). A typical example of a symbiotic relationship is the mutualistic interaction between endophytic bacteria and plants. The intricate dynamics between these two entities are influenced by a variety of variables, such as environmental characteristics (such as soil composition and nutrient availability), the genetic makeup of both endophytes and host plants, as well as the growth and developmental stages of the host plants themselves ( de Vries et al., 2018; Korenblum et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021 ).",
          "According to Pang et al. (2022) , plant growth-promoting Streptomyces (PGPS) is essential for increasing plant growth and enhancing tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stressors. In a previous study, the Streptomyces chartreusis strain WZS021 was isolated from the root tissue of sugarcane and has the ability to fix nitrogen and improve plant growth, notably in terms of root biomass accumulation ( Wang et al., 2017 ). The inoculation of S. chartreusis WZS021 causes significant changes in the content of antioxidant chemicals in sugarcane leaves under drought conditions. Additionally, this procedure triggers a systemic tolerance mechanism that strengthens sugarcane's tolerance to drought ( Wang et al., 2019 ). S. griseorubiginosus strain BTU6 from sugarcane rhizosphere soil can produce a variety of strong chemicals that are resistant to peptidoglycan and polyketide, according to genomic analysis of the strain ( Wang et al., 2021 ). These substances include terpene, woolly peptide, polyketide, and γ-butyrolactone. This finding suggests a likely mechanism through which Streptomyces increases disease resistance in sugarcane plants. This discovery highlights the importance of actinomycete species related to sugarcane by illuminating their crucial function in microbial ecology and their contribution to plant growth stimulation ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Even while beneficial bacteria are necessary for increasing plant stress resistance, it is still unclear exactly how they affect the rhizosphere. In order to systematically comprehend how Plant Growth-Promoting Streptomyces (PGPS) promotes plant growth. We put forward the hypothesis that the introduction of S. chartreusis strain WZS021, which is connected to drought resistance and nitrogen fixation, and Streptomyces S. griseorubiginosus strain BTU6, which is associated with resistance to smut disease, will bring about noteworthy alterations in soil enzymes and physicochemical properties. These alterations will enhance the composition of soil microbial communities, augment the microenvironmental mechanisms that provide support for plant growth, and ultimately lead to heightened tolerance to stress and improved growth of plants within the root microenvironment. We examine how soil enzymes and physicochemical properties have altered since the introduction of S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 (linked to smut disease resistance) and S. chartreusis WZS021 (associated with drought resistance and nitrogen fixation), the effects of PGPS on the microbial community structure in and around plant roots, the distinct mechanisms through which diverse functional microorganisms foster regular plant growth and augment stress resilience, root microenvironment's role in Streptomyces -mediated enhancement. This comprehensive approach seeks to shed light on the intricate relationship between PGPS and plant growth, ultimately expanding our understanding of the various mechanisms that support improved root microenvironments and increased stress tolerance."

              "Sugarcane seedlings ( Saccharum spp. Hybrid var . ROC22) were sourced from the Sugarcane Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Nanning, China). The inoculants, namely, S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6, utilized in this experiment, were obtained from previous studies ( Wang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021 ). WZS021 is characterized by its nitrogen fixation ability and its capacity to enhance improve drought tolerance in plant, whereas BTU6 exhibits resistance to smut. The experimental setup took place within a controlled greenhouse facility at the Agricultural College of Guangxi University. This greenhouse offered an environment, in which various factors such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity, could be meticulously regulated to replicate actual environmental conditions. The experiment employed standardized pots, each measuring 45 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter. Approximately 20 kg of soil was placed in each pot. To simulate typical agricultural soil found in the Guangxi region and ensure the experiment's relevance to local farming practices, a specially formulated soil blend was used. To eliminate potential contaminants, pests, and pathogens, the soil underwent sterilization under controlled conditions involving heat and moisture (121 °C, 30 min). The formulated soil blend was adjusted to closely mimic the nutrient composition of agricultural soils in Guangxi. Organic matter (OM) was added to replicate the natural organic content present in the region's soils. The specific nutrient content was fine-tuned based on comprehensive soil analysis and consultation with local agricultural experts, as detailed in Table S1 . The experiment involved three treatments: a control (CK) group, inoculation with the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 strain, and inoculation with S. chartreusis WZS021. Ten pots were assigned to each treatment. Cane setts were immersed in a bacterial suspension (∼ 10 6 cfu mL -1 ) at room temperature for 1 h following a 30 min soak in 52 °C water and then planted. Subsequently, a fresh bacterial suspension (200 mL) was inoculated once every two months. Samples were collected at four-time points: 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after inoculation to capture dynamic changes during the experiment. Rhizospheric soil samples of 2 g were collected from the immediate vicinity of each plant’s roots, following the method outlined by Bulgarelli et al. (2012) . Simultaneously, 1 g root sample were collected from the same plant at each time point, and 5 plants tested at each time point to ensure repeatability."

Total DNA from soil and plant roots was extracted using E.Z.N.A.® Soil DNA and Plant DNA Maxi kits (Omega bio-tek, Norcross, Georgia), respectively. DNA concentration was determined using Qubit2.0, and integrity was assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicon sequencing was performed by Pfomic Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Nanning, China).

Notably, in comparison to the control treatment (CK), the soil treated with S. chartreusis WZS021 exhibited significantly higher levels of OM, hydrolyzable nitrogen (HN), available phosphorus (AP), available copper (ACu), available zinc (AZn), and available manganese (AMn), with the exception of the 10-day period after inoculation (10 DAI). Conversely, treatment with S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 resulted in noticeably increases in AP, ACu (at 30 and 40 DAI), HN (at 40 DAI), and AZn (except at 10 DAI) compared to the CK. Moreover, levels of AMn and available iron (AFe) were significantly higher at 30 DAI in comparison to the CK. It is worth mentioning that, across the treatments, there were no statistically significant changes in the profiles of total nitrogen (TN) and accessible potassium (AK) ( Fig. 1 ). The inoculation of S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 or S. chartreusis WZS021 had a notably favorable impact on the physicochemical characteristics of the rhizospheric soil.

Notably, Gemmatimonadetes and Verrucomicrobia experienced a significant increase in relative abundance ( Fig. 3 A). Proteobacteria were more prevalent than Actinobacteria in both treatments, mirroring the pattern observed in rhizospheric bacteria, but Actinobacteria were notably less abundant than Proteobacteria.

In contrast, samples from the S. griseorubiginosus and S. chartreusis treatments in the endophytic microbial community clustered together, distinctly separate from the CK samples ( Fig. 4 B, D). Consequently, while the rhizospheric soil microbial communities of the two inoculation treatments were significantly different from the CK community, they exhibited a degree of similarity to each other."

              "Regarding the correlation between microorganisms and soil properties, as well as microorganisms and nitrogen-related active substances, we observed several significant associations. Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were strongly negatively correlated with AKP, DHA, and AK, while Proteobacteria showed significant positive associations with these soil properties across the major rhizosphere bacterial groups ( Fig. 5 A). Additionally, actinobacteria exhibited a notable negative connection with AMn, AZn, and ACu. The phylum Gemmatimonadetes displayed substantial positive associations with all three soil enzymes, AP, and ACu. Notably, Chloroflexi and Basidiomycota exhibited significantly unfavorable relationships with DHA levels. Therefore, AKP, DHA, and AK emerged as the primary environmental factors influencing the dominant flora in rhizosphere soil.",
              "Among endophytic bacteria, Proteobacteria abundance was positively associated with parameters related to nitrogen metabolism (except GOT), whereas Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi displayed considerable negative correlations. The prevalence of Bacteroidetes and Fibrobacter showed no significant correlations with any of the major environmental influences ( Fig. 5 B). In the case of endophytic fungi, Ascomycota exhibited a significant negative association with OM and AP. In the rhizosphere, OM, AP, and DHA were identified as the primary correlates of the dominant fungal flora ( Fig. 5 C). These trends were consistent for endophytic fungi, where most environmental factors (except GOT and SS) displayed a positive correlation with Ascomycota and a negative correlation with Basidiomycota ( Fig. 5 C), suggesting their role in shaping endophytic microorganism composition. Notably, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fibrobacter in endophytic bacteria remained unaltered after exposure to S. chartreusis and S. griseorubiginosus ."

              "Following the application of microbial fertilizer, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was employed to explore potential links between soil chemistry and microbial community composition following inoculation of two microbes. The analysis considered OTUs (clustering > 97 %) as microbial species data and soil chemistry and nitrogen metabolism information as environmental factors. The first two axes of the CCA analysis explained a significant portion of the variation in rhizospheric soil microbial community composition (53.35–62.32 %) ( Fig. 6 A-D).",
              "Specifically, the analysis revealed key environmental factors influencing bacterial species in the rhizosphere, with DHA and AKP emerging as significant contributors. Total nitrogen (TN) content was significantly correlated with the distribution of various bacterial species in the CK rhizosphere. Notably, the structural distributions of microbial communities following treatments with S. griseorubiginosus and S. chartreusis showed positive associations with most influencing factors (except TN). DHA was identified as the environmental component exerting the greatest influence on the rhizosphere fungal species’ composition. Interestingly, DHA showed a positive association with microbial population after S. griseorubiginosus inoculation but a negative association with microbial population following S. chartreusis treatment. The distribution of fungal species in the CK rhizosphere was inversely correlated with OM ( Fig. 6 C). Similar patterns were observed for the impact of plant N-metabolizing compounds on endophytic bacteria and fungi. The CCA analysis focused on the distribution of active compounds associated with N metabolism in root endophytic microbial populations. The results showed that after S. chartreusis WZS021 treatment, the abundance of endophytic microbial communities (both bacterial and fungal) was positively correlated with all environmental parameters. Conversely, in the CK and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatments, there was a negative correlation between these variables and the number of endophytic microbes ( Fig. 6 B, D). Notably, GPT and GOT emerged as the primary contributors to these relationships among the influencing factors."

          "The chemical composition of soil profoundly influences microbial community structure and plant growth and development. These attributes serve as critical biological indicators of soil fertility ( Whittinghill and Hobbie, 2012 ). In our study, the inoculation of S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 actinomycete strains resulted in various increases in soil nutrients, with the exception of TN and AK. This rise in nutrient concentrations demonstrated the treatments' successful improvement of soil fertility, creating a favorable environment for typical plant growth and development.",
          "It is well-known that soil enzymes play a pivotal role in facilitating substance exchange between soil and plants ( Li et al., 2016 ). These enzymes are indispensable mediators in soil ecosystems as they actively participate in the metabolic cycles of energy and nutrients in the soil. Notably, soil enzyme activity provides a comprehensive assessment of nutrient reserves and the robustness of biochemical reactions within the soil system, which can indicate changes in microbial populations and soil improvement activities ( Liu et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2022 ). Our study highlighted the significant influence of the inoculation treatment on soil enzyme activities, particularly evident at 30 DAI. AKP, DHA, and urease were three crucial soil enzymes whose activity significantly increased during this period. These findings suggest that the inoculation process played a crucial role in modifying nutrient metabolism in the sugarcane rhizosphere soil, ultimately enhancing the environment for plant growth. Interestingly, soil enzyme activity can also serve as a valuable indicator of soil quality in the context of heavy metal stress ( Song et al., 2022 ). The activity of soil enzymes, particularly DHA, is a vital biomarker of soil microbial activity, as it responds to the biomass of living organisms in the soil. DHA is predominantly abundant in all living microbial cells and is directly linked to microbial redox processes ( Małachowska-Jutsz and Matyja, 2019 ). Our findings revealed that DHA activity in the rhizosphere of the soil was significantly influenced by the inoculation with S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 or S. chartreusis WZS021. This increase in enzyme activity implies a larger microbial population, subsequently supporting microbial redox activities in the rhizosphere. Urease, an essential hydrolytic enzyme crucial in the nitrogen metabolic cycle and the decomposition of urea in soil ( Cui et al., 2022 ), also exhibited noteworthy increases in activity in the rhizosphere soil after inoculation with WZS021. This indicates the positive role of this strain in nitrogen cycling and rhizosphere soil plant utilization. While BTU6 also led to an increase in urease activity, its effect was not as pronounced as that of WZS021. This finding underscores how actinomycete inoculation promotes the accumulation of enzymes and other active ingredients (SP, SS, and Nitrate N) involved in nitrogen metabolism, thereby enhancing nutrient cycling in sugarcane. Through the activation and decomposition of organic matter in the soil, soil enzymes release nutrients that plants can directly utilize. Soil enzyme activity indirectly reflects soil fertility ( Huang et al., 2017 ). Among these enzymes, AKP plays an essential role as a catalyst for converting organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphorus, which plants can readily absorb and utilize ( Wang et al., 2022 ). Notably, WZS021 and BTU6 do not possess the ability to solubilize phosphorus themselves ( Wang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021 ). However, inoculation promotes the transformation of inorganic phosphorus in the rhizosphere soil by affecting AKP, enriching rhizosphere inorganic phosphorus stocks and assisting plants in better absorbing and utilizing phosphorus.",
          "Microorganisms primarily inhabit OM-rich environments and play a vital role in soil biological activity ( Chen et al., 2020 ). They are pivotal forces in the transformation and utilization of soil nutrients, actively contributing to the decomposition of OM and the development of soil humus ( Yarwood, 2018 ). Elements in the soil, such as moisture, physicochemical properties, and enzyme activity, directly impact microbial community structure. These bacteria help preserve and enhance soil fertility by secreting secondary metabolites ( Tan et al., 2021 ). In our study, the most prevalent fungal groups were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota, while the dominant bacterial groups included Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria ( Fig. 3 A-D), aligning with previous research ( Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2020; Díaz-Cruz and Cassone, 2022 ). Interestingly, among endophytic bacteria, Bacteroides emerged as the dominant group, despite its relative rarity in the rhizospheric bacteria. Bacteroides are closely linked to the conversion of organic materials, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, which are vital components of the N cycle ( Michaud et al., 2009 ). This likely explains the enhanced nitrogen utilization by sugarcane following inoculation with S. chartreusis WZS021, as reported by Wang et al. (2017) .",
          "After treatment with S. chartreusis WZS021 diversity indices in rhizospheric soil significantly increased, indicating a positive impact on soil diversity. Notably, r-selected bacteria, such as proteobacteria, thrive in nutrient-rich environments, while K-selected bacteria like Acidobacteria prefer nutrient-poor conditions ( Fierer et al., 2007; Fierer et al., 2012 ). Actinomycete-treated rhizospheric soil showed a higher relative abundance of Acidobacteria than Proteobacteria, highlighting the successful enhancement of soil fertility through actinomycete inoculation. Interestingly, the prevalence of Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria was inversely correlated with the application of organic fertilizers ( Tian et al., 2015 ). Sun et al. (2014) suggested that Actinomycetes secrete bacteriocins, influencing the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi , possibly explaining our similar findings. It’s important to note that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria decreased after actinomycete application, possibly due to the secretion of bacteriocins by the inoculated strains which can inhibit the growth of related microbes and regulate the microbiota ( Wang et al., 2022 ). Our study's organization of the sugarcane rhizosphere bacterial community was somewhat comparable to that of Brazilian sugarcane ( Pisa et al., 2011 ), suggesting universality in the design of rhizosphere bacterial populations. The distribution of fungal communities in ecosystems is closely tied to soil N metabolism ( Cox et al., 2010 ). Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, which are primary OM decomposers, play critical roles in rhizosphere N recycling and plant growth ( Yelle et al., 2008 ). Inoculation with two Streptomyces strains inhibited the growth of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, but promoted the proliferation of unknown fungi. Therefore, the increased phylogenetic diversity in both treatments, compared to the CK, was largely attributed to these changes. Notably, despite the lower relative abundance of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, the inoculated soil maintained high nutrient levels, suggesting the potential presence of unidentified fungi with similar functions. We recommend using high-throughput sequencing techniques to gain insights into these unidentified species, followed by various culture techniques to determine their taxonomic status and roles. S. chartreusis WZS021, known for promoting N fixation and enhancing plant stress resilience, may be associated with the increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria within endophytic bacteria. Conversely, treatment with S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 elevated the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere and Fibrobacteres within endophytic bacteria, potentially bolstering disease resistance. Moreover, Gemmatimonas increased in prevalence, while the pathogen Xanthomonas exhibited reduced relative abundance. These findings emphasize the potential role of these bacterial strains in shaping microbial dynamics within the plant's ecosystem ( Timilsina et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Carotenoids, essential for improving plant photosynthesis and salt tolerance, are produced by the Gemmatimonas bacterium ( Takaichi et al., 2010 ). The relative abundance of Dechloromonas among endophytic bacteria noticeably increased following S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatment. In contrast, S. chartreusis WZS021-treated plants showed an increased relative abundance of Pseudomonas and a decrease in Hydrogenophaga . Additionally, Aspergillus became the predominant fungal strain among endophytes after S. chartreusis WZS021 treatment ( Fig. 7 ). Previous studies have suggested that Aspergillus can boost antioxidant activity and increase the release of plant phenolics ( Dulf et al., 2015; Dulf et al., 2016 ), contributing to improved drought resistance Wang et al. (2019) . These findings suggest that S. chartreusis WZS021's impact on microbial community structure could indirectly enhance plant drought resistance by influencing the composition and function of the endophytic fungal community's. While clear differences in microbial population composition existed between the control group (CK) and the two treatments, there was a stronger similarity between the two treatments, particularly in the endophytic microbial community. Importantly, there was no overlap in the distribution patterns of samples treated with S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 ( Fig. 4 ), indicating distinct microbial community compositions due to the functional differences between the two strains. In conclusion, inoculation altered the composition of the microbial community without changing the dominant groups. The CCA revealed a positive correlation between rhizospheric soil nutrient levels and post-inoculation bacterial abundance. Microbial populations increased significantly, closely associated with nutrient availability, as S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 improved soil nutrients. Fig. 3 C highlights a substantial increase in the relative abundance of unclassified fungal species in the rhizospheric soil following inoculation. These fungi may possess unique properties that enhance plant resilience and contribute to plant growth. It's crucial to remember that PGPS may indirectly affect plant growth by altering the microbial community’s composition. Nitrogen application alters microbial N cycle activities, including nitrification and N fixation, leading to changes in fungal communities in forest ecosystems ( Morrison et al., 2016 ). The enrichment of endophytic fungi after treatment with S. chartreusis WZS021 was positively linked to N-metabolizing enzymes and active compounds, indicating that this strain not only possesses N fixation ability but also influences plant N metabolism by endophytic fungal population.",
          "Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between microbial communities and sugarcane plants following actinomycete inoculation, shedding light on their potential role in enhancing soil fertility and plant growth. Further research is warranted to explore the functional roles of specific microbial groups and their impact on plant health and productivity in greater detail."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction A holobiont is a symbiotic organism created due to the coevolution of plant populations and microbial populations over a protracted period. In this intricate relationship, the host plant and the associated microbial community work together as an integrated unit to affect the plant's overall structure. These components work together to create a solid connection that connects these constituents' ecological dynamics and evolutionary pathways ( Trivedi et al., 2020 ). The soil microbiota dominates the entire biological cycle ( Janvier et al., 2007 ). Microorganisms are selected and enriched by the plant root system to form the rhizosphere microbiome ( Hiruma et al., 2016; Durán et al., 2018 ), which accompanies plants throughout their growth cycle and participates in critical physiological processes such as growth and development, nutrient uptake, and disease and stress resistance ( Castrillo et al., 2017; Van Deynze et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019 ). High-throughput sequencing is a valuable tool for revealing the diversity and composition of microorganisms in various soil ecosystems ( Thompson et al., 2017 ). While the significance of the rhizosphere and its microbial residents in the well-being and development of plants has been acknowledged, there exists a distinct void in knowledge concerning the specific mechanisms that underlie the interaction between microbes that promote plant growth and the microenvironment of the roots. Furthermore, the precise function of Streptomyces species, particularly those that promote plant growth, in augmenting plant development and the ability to withstand stress within this framework, remains to be fully comprehended. Microbial inoculants are biological products used in agriculture with microbial life activities and products that can significantly improve soil fertility ( Berg et al., 2021 ). Enhancing the activity and population of beneficial microbiota is essential for improving the physicochemical properties and nutrients of the soil, and microbial fertilizers can stimulate the life activity of soil microorganisms when applied to the soil ( Arif et al., 2020 ). The life activity of beneficial microorganisms converts nutrients into active components in the soil that can be absorbed and used by the plant body, thereby extending the retention time of fertilization ( Cardinale et al., 2006; Enwall et al., 2007 ). Complex interactions between plants and soil microorganisms occur in the rhizosphere. The rhizosphere is directly influenced by plant roots and secretions and is an important site for microbial colonization and activity: on the one hand, plants provide substrates and signaling molecules for the growth of microbes in the rhizosphere through root secretions ( Rajniak et al., 2018; Stringlis et al., 2018 ); on the other hand, rhizospheric microbes increase the effectiveness of rhizosphere nutrient uptake ( Jamil et al., 2022 ) and enhance plant immunity to biotic and abiotic stresses ( Saeed et al., 2021; Chamkhi et al., 2022 ). Soil microorganisms are involved in soil organic matter (OM) decomposition and nutrient cycling and play a key role in maintaining the function and sustainability of soil ecosystems and soil science management ( Lou et al., 2011 ). A typical example of a symbiotic relationship is the mutualistic interaction between endophytic bacteria and plants. The intricate dynamics between these two entities are influenced by a variety of variables, such as environmental characteristics (such as soil composition and nutrient availability), the genetic makeup of both endophytes and host plants, as well as the growth and developmental stages of the host plants themselves ( de Vries et al., 2018; Korenblum et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021 ). According to Pang et al. (2022) , plant growth-promoting Streptomyces (PGPS) is essential for increasing plant growth and enhancing tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stressors. In a previous study, the Streptomyces chartreusis strain WZS021 was isolated from the root tissue of sugarcane and has the ability to fix nitrogen and improve plant growth, notably in terms of root biomass accumulation ( Wang et al., 2017 ). The inoculation of S. chartreusis WZS021 causes significant changes in the content of antioxidant chemicals in sugarcane leaves under drought conditions. Additionally, this procedure triggers a systemic tolerance mechanism that strengthens sugarcane's tolerance to drought ( Wang et al., 2019 ). S. griseorubiginosus strain BTU6 from sugarcane rhizosphere soil can produce a variety of strong chemicals that are resistant to peptidoglycan and polyketide, according to genomic analysis of the strain ( Wang et al., 2021 ). These substances include terpene, woolly peptide, polyketide, and γ-butyrolactone. This finding suggests a likely mechanism through which Streptomyces increases disease resistance in sugarcane plants. This discovery highlights the importance of actinomycete species related to sugarcane by illuminating their crucial function in microbial ecology and their contribution to plant growth stimulation ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Even while beneficial bacteria are necessary for increasing plant stress resistance, it is still unclear exactly how they affect the rhizosphere. In order to systematically comprehend how Plant Growth-Promoting Streptomyces (PGPS) promotes plant growth. We put forward the hypothesis that the introduction of S. chartreusis strain WZS021, which is connected to drought resistance and nitrogen fixation, and Streptomyces S. griseorubiginosus strain BTU6, which is associated with resistance to smut disease, will bring about noteworthy alterations in soil enzymes and physicochemical properties. These alterations will enhance the composition of soil microbial communities, augment the microenvironmental mechanisms that provide support for plant growth, and ultimately lead to heightened tolerance to stress and improved growth of plants within the root microenvironment. We examine how soil enzymes and physicochemical properties have altered since the introduction of S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 (linked to smut disease resistance) and S. chartreusis WZS021 (associated with drought resistance and nitrogen fixation), the effects of PGPS on the microbial community structure in and around plant roots, the distinct mechanisms through which diverse functional microorganisms foster regular plant growth and augment stress resilience, root microenvironment's role in Streptomyces -mediated enhancement. This comprehensive approach seeks to shed light on the intricate relationship between PGPS and plant growth, ultimately expanding our understanding of the various mechanisms that support improved root microenvironments and increased stress tolerance. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Greenhouse experiments and sample collection Sugarcane seedlings ( Saccharum spp. Hybrid var . ROC22) were sourced from the Sugarcane Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Nanning, China). The inoculants, namely, S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6, utilized in this experiment, were obtained from previous studies ( Wang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021 ). WZS021 is characterized by its nitrogen fixation ability and its capacity to enhance improve drought tolerance in plant, whereas BTU6 exhibits resistance to smut. The experimental setup took place within a controlled greenhouse facility at the Agricultural College of Guangxi University. This greenhouse offered an environment, in which various factors such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity, could be meticulously regulated to replicate actual environmental conditions. The experiment employed standardized pots, each measuring 45 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter. Approximately 20 kg of soil was placed in each pot. To simulate typical agricultural soil found in the Guangxi region and ensure the experiment's relevance to local farming practices, a specially formulated soil blend was used. To eliminate potential contaminants, pests, and pathogens, the soil underwent sterilization under controlled conditions involving heat and moisture (121 °C, 30 min). The formulated soil blend was adjusted to closely mimic the nutrient composition of agricultural soils in Guangxi. Organic matter (OM) was added to replicate the natural organic content present in the region's soils. The specific nutrient content was fine-tuned based on comprehensive soil analysis and consultation with local agricultural experts, as detailed in Table S1 . The experiment involved three treatments: a control (CK) group, inoculation with the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 strain, and inoculation with S. chartreusis WZS021. Ten pots were assigned to each treatment. Cane setts were immersed in a bacterial suspension (∼ 10 6 cfu mL -1 ) at room temperature for 1 h following a 30 min soak in 52 °C water and then planted. Subsequently, a fresh bacterial suspension (200 mL) was inoculated once every two months. Samples were collected at four-time points: 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after inoculation to capture dynamic changes during the experiment. Rhizospheric soil samples of 2 g were collected from the immediate vicinity of each plant’s roots, following the method outlined by Bulgarelli et al. (2012) . Simultaneously, 1 g root sample were collected from the same plant at each time point, and 5 plants tested at each time point to ensure repeatability. 2.2 Enzyme activity and chemical properties of rhizospheric soils The collected soil samples were air-dried, and approximately 0.1 g of soil was individually weighed for the determine of soil enzyme activities. Alkaline phosphatase (AKP, cat. No. BC0285), urease (cat. No. BC0120), and dehydrogenase (DHA, cat. No. BC0395) were measured using kits (Solarbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Soil properties, including total N (TN), OM, hydrolyzable N (HN), available P (AP), available K (AK), available Cu (ACu), available Zn (AZn), available Fe (AFe), and available Mn (AMn) were determined at the Institute of Soil Chemistry of Guangxi University. 2.3 N metabolism-related enzymes and active substance content of sugarcane roots Sugarcane root samples, once collected, were thoroughly rinsed with ddH 2 O and subsequently ground. The determination of glutamine synthetase (GS, cat. No. BC0910), nitrate reductase (NR, cat. No. BC0080), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT, cat. No. BC1550), and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT, cat. No. BC1560) was conducted using kits (Solarbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). For soluble sugar (SS), 0.5 g of a freshly mixed sample was placed into a test tube, weighed, and 15 mL of distilled water was added. The sample was boiled in a water bath for 20 min, removed and allowed to cool. Subsequently, 5 mL of anthraquinone reagent was added per mL. The optical density was determined and this process was repeated three times. Soluble protein (SP) was determined using the Bradford method ( Bradford, 1976 ). Nitrate N content was determined using the nitrosalicylic acid method ( Chaney, 1990 ), which involves the formation of nitrosalicylic acid under concentrated acid conditions, resulting in a yellow coloration under alkaline conditions (pH > 12). The color intensity is directly proportional to the NO 3 - content and is determined calorimetrically. 2.4 Soil and root total DNA extraction and amplicon sequencing Rhizospheric soil and plant root samples were selected at 30 days after inoculation (DAI) to examine differences in microbial community structure between inoculated and non-inoculated samples. Prior to DNA extraction, samples were treated samples with propidium monoazide at a final concentration of 0.4 μM to minimize the possible effects of the remaining residual DNA from dead cells on microbial abundance and diversity ( Carini et al., 2016 ). Total DNA from soil and plant roots was extracted using E.Z.N.A.® Soil DNA and Plant DNA Maxi kits (Omega bio-tek, Norcross, Georgia), respectively. DNA concentration was determined using Qubit2.0, and integrity was assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicon sequencing was performed by Pfomic Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Nanning, China). For the 16 S rRNA gene, amplification from the soil targeted the V4 high-variance region using universal primers 515 F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTA) and 805 R (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC). To avoid interference from mitochondrial and chlorophyll DNA, amplification of the 16 S rRNA gene from plant root endophytic bacteria targeted the V5-V7 region using primers 799 F (AACMGGATTAGATACCCKG) and 1193 R (ACGTCATCCCCACCTTCC). For ITS genes, ITS1–1737 F (GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG) and ITS2–2043R (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) were used. The amplification conditions were as follows: pre-denaturation at 94 ℃ for 3 min, denaturation at 94 ℃ for 30 s, annealing at 45 ℃ for 20 s, extension at 65 ℃ for 30 s, 5 cycles; extension at 94 ℃ for 20 s, annealing at 55 ℃ for 20 s, extension at 72 ℃ for 30 s, 20 cycles. The mixed PCR products were purified using the Qiagen Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany). Sequencing libraries were generated using the Truseq® DNA PCR-free Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Library quality was assessed using a fluorometer (Qubit® 2.0) and the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Finally, the library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, generating paired-end reads of 250 bp. The obtained sequences were uploaded to NCBI, and the accession number PRJNA561896 was assigned. 2.5 Data processing and analysis The raw data were spliced using FLASH software V1.2.7 ( Magoč and Salzberg, 2011 ). The spliced sequences underwent quality filtering using Trimmomatic software ( Bolger et al., 2014 ), and chimeras were removed using UCHIME software ( Edgar et al., 2011 ) to obtain high-quality tag sequences. Sequence analysis was performed using Uparse software v7.0 ( Edgar, 2013 ). Sequences with ≥ 97 % similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Representative sequences from each OTU were screened for further species annotation using the RDP Classifier ( Wang et al., 2007 ). Alpha index analysis, including Chao1 richness estimator, Ace richness estimator, Shannon diversity index, and Simpson diversity index, was conducted using Mothur software v.1.30 ( Schloss et al., 2009 ). Beta diversity analyses, such as principal component analysis (PCA), principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), and correlation analysis of environmental factors with sample composition (RDA/CCA), were graphically visualized using R software v 2.15.3. 2.6 Statistical analysis One-way ANOVA was performed using SPSS 26 statistical software. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between soil variables and bacterial taxa were calculated using PAST3 software ( Hammer et al., 2001 ). Heat maps were generated using the ClustVis online tool ( Metsalu and Vilo, 2015 ). 3 Results 3.1 Impact of inoculated bacteria on soil chemistry We conducted an analysis to assess changes in the nutrient composition of the rhizospheric soil, aiming to comprehend the effects of the two inoculants on soil chemistry and their adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Several critical nutritional markers were examined in this context. Notably, in comparison to the control treatment (CK), the soil treated with S. chartreusis WZS021 exhibited significantly higher levels of OM, hydrolyzable nitrogen (HN), available phosphorus (AP), available copper (ACu), available zinc (AZn), and available manganese (AMn), with the exception of the 10-day period after inoculation (10 DAI). Conversely, treatment with S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 resulted in noticeably increases in AP, ACu (at 30 and 40 DAI), HN (at 40 DAI), and AZn (except at 10 DAI) compared to the CK. Moreover, levels of AMn and available iron (AFe) were significantly higher at 30 DAI in comparison to the CK. It is worth mentioning that, across the treatments, there were no statistically significant changes in the profiles of total nitrogen (TN) and accessible potassium (AK) ( Fig. 1 ). The inoculation of S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 or S. chartreusis WZS021 had a notably favorable impact on the physicochemical characteristics of the rhizospheric soil. However, it is important to note that, compared to the effects of S. griseorubiginosus BTU6, S. chartreusis WZS021 had a more variable impact on these characteristics ( Fig. 1 ). 3.2 Effect of inoculated bacteria on soil enzyme activity Inoculation with either S. chartreusis WZS021 or S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 led to changes in the activity of soil enzymes AKP, DHA, and urease. Specifically, AKP activity in the soil's rhizosphere significantly increased when S. chartreusis WZS021 was inoculated compared to the control group (CK). At 20, 30, and 40 DAI, AKP activity was notably enhanced in the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatment. However, it is worth noting that, at 10, 30, and 40 DAI, AKP activity was significantly higher in the S. chartreusis WZS021 treatment than in the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatment. Urease activity was considerably higher in the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatment than in the CK at 10 and 30 DAI. In contrast, at 20, 30, and 40 DAI, the S. chartreusis WZS021 treatment exhibited significantly higher urease activity than the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatment. Soil DHA activity in the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 and S. chartreusis WZS021 treatments was found to be 3.7 and 2.6 times higher, respectively, when compared to the CK ( Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, S. chartreusis WZS021 displayed significantly lower DHA activity than S. griseorubiginosus BTU6, especially at 20, 30, and 40 DAI. AKP, urease, and DHA activities in sugarcane rhizospheric soil following S. chartreusis WZS021 inoculation consistently exceeded those in the CK throughout the experimental phase. Notably, the effects of the three treatments on AKP, urease, and DHA activities were most pronounced at 30 DAI. Consequently, samples from the 30 DAI time point were selected for high-throughput sequencing to gain further insights into the microbial community composition. 3.3 Plant nitrogen metabolism-related enzymes and active substances Regarding the traits of the plant roots modified by the two inoculants, an intriguing pattern emerged Plant roots treated with S. chartreusis displayed significantly higher levels of GOT, GPT, GS, and NR compared to those treated with CK and S. griseorubiginosus . Similar, S. griseorubiginosus treatment resulted in significantly higher levels of GOT (at 10 and 20 DAI), GPT (at 20 DAI), GS (at 10, 20, and 40 DAI), and NR (at 10 and 30 DAI) compared to the CK. At 30 and 40 DAI, the GOT levels in the CK were higher than those in the S. griseorubiginosus treatment, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance. Notably, S. chartreusis , S. griseorubiginosus , and CK exhibited notable variations in SP and Nitrate N contents, in that order ( Fig. S1 ). At 30 DAI, SS levels were notably higher in the both S. chartreusis and S. griseorubiginosus treatments. Interestingly, SP, SS, and Nitrate N reached their highest values during the S. chartreusis treatment ( Fig. S2 ). 3.4 Changes in soil microbial alpha diversity Following treatment with S. chartreusis compared to the CK, the Shannon index, Chao1 index, ACE index, and phylogenetic diversity indices for rhizosphere bacterial species were significantly greater. Except for phylogenetic diversity, all diversity indices increased following S. griseorubiginosus treatment ( Table 1 ). Notably, a substantial distinction was observed in endophytic bacteria: S. chartreusis WZS021's diversity index was much lower than those of CK and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6, while the latter did not significantly differ from CK. Regarding rhizosphere fungi, the Shannon index was much higher in the CK treatment than in the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatment. However, S. griseorubiginosus and S. chartreusis treatments had significantly higher levels of phylogenetic diversity than the CK. However, no discernible variations were observed in the diversity indices of endophytic fungi. 3.5 Phylum-level distribution and microbial community composition At the phylum level, where species’ relative abundance was assessed for each treatment group, Proteobacteria were the dominant phylum, followed by Acidobacteria . Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi exhibited significantly reduced prevalence in the soil following the inoculation treatment, while Gemmatimonadetes displayed a higher relative abundance compared to these two phyla. Notably, Gemmatimonadetes and Verrucomicrobia experienced a significant increase in relative abundance ( Fig. 3 A). Proteobacteria were more prevalent than Actinobacteria in both treatments, mirroring the pattern observed in rhizospheric bacteria, but Actinobacteria were notably less abundant than Proteobacteria. Interestingly, Bacteroidetes outperformed Acidobacteria, becoming the second-most dominant class of endophytic bacteria. Furthermore, in comparison to the S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatment group, the S. chartreusis WZS021 treatment group exhibited a greater relative abundance of Proteobacteria ( Fig. 3 B). Among rhizosphere fungi, Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota, constituted the major groups ( Fig. 3 C). The relative abundances of these two dominant fungal groups drastically declined following inoculation with S. chartreusis and S. griseorubiginosus , leading to the emergence of several unidentified fungal species. In the endophytic fungus community, Ascomycota and Zygomycota exhibited higher relative abundances ( Fig. 3 D). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) indicated that both S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatments had samples with a similar distribution, distinct from the CK samples. These findings, coupled with Venn diagram analysis ( Fig. S3 ), suggest a relatively higher degree of similarity between the rhizospheric soil microbial community compositions of the S. griseorubiginosus and S. chartreusis treatments, while both treatments were notably distinct from the CK microbial community composition. 3.6 Influence of microbial inoculation on rhizospheric and endophytic microbial communities The inoculation of S. chartreusis WZS021 or S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 resulted in significant differences in rhizospheric microorganisms ( Fig. 4 A, C), leading to substantial alterations in the plant growth environment’s microbial composition. In contrast, samples from the S. griseorubiginosus and S. chartreusis treatments in the endophytic microbial community clustered together, distinctly separate from the CK samples ( Fig. 4 B, D). Consequently, while the rhizospheric soil microbial communities of the two inoculation treatments were significantly different from the CK community, they exhibited a degree of similarity to each other. 3.7 Correlation analysis Regarding the correlation between microorganisms and soil properties, as well as microorganisms and nitrogen-related active substances, we observed several significant associations. Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were strongly negatively correlated with AKP, DHA, and AK, while Proteobacteria showed significant positive associations with these soil properties across the major rhizosphere bacterial groups ( Fig. 5 A). Additionally, actinobacteria exhibited a notable negative connection with AMn, AZn, and ACu. The phylum Gemmatimonadetes displayed substantial positive associations with all three soil enzymes, AP, and ACu. Notably, Chloroflexi and Basidiomycota exhibited significantly unfavorable relationships with DHA levels. Therefore, AKP, DHA, and AK emerged as the primary environmental factors influencing the dominant flora in rhizosphere soil. Among endophytic bacteria, Proteobacteria abundance was positively associated with parameters related to nitrogen metabolism (except GOT), whereas Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi displayed considerable negative correlations. The prevalence of Bacteroidetes and Fibrobacter showed no significant correlations with any of the major environmental influences ( Fig. 5 B). In the case of endophytic fungi, Ascomycota exhibited a significant negative association with OM and AP. In the rhizosphere, OM, AP, and DHA were identified as the primary correlates of the dominant fungal flora ( Fig. 5 C). These trends were consistent for endophytic fungi, where most environmental factors (except GOT and SS) displayed a positive correlation with Ascomycota and a negative correlation with Basidiomycota ( Fig. 5 C), suggesting their role in shaping endophytic microorganism composition. Notably, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fibrobacter in endophytic bacteria remained unaltered after exposure to S. chartreusis and S. griseorubiginosus . 3.8 Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) analysis Following the application of microbial fertilizer, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was employed to explore potential links between soil chemistry and microbial community composition following inoculation of two microbes. The analysis considered OTUs (clustering > 97 %) as microbial species data and soil chemistry and nitrogen metabolism information as environmental factors. The first two axes of the CCA analysis explained a significant portion of the variation in rhizospheric soil microbial community composition (53.35–62.32 %) ( Fig. 6 A-D). Specifically, the analysis revealed key environmental factors influencing bacterial species in the rhizosphere, with DHA and AKP emerging as significant contributors. Total nitrogen (TN) content was significantly correlated with the distribution of various bacterial species in the CK rhizosphere. Notably, the structural distributions of microbial communities following treatments with S. griseorubiginosus and S. chartreusis showed positive associations with most influencing factors (except TN). DHA was identified as the environmental component exerting the greatest influence on the rhizosphere fungal species’ composition. Interestingly, DHA showed a positive association with microbial population after S. griseorubiginosus inoculation but a negative association with microbial population following S. chartreusis treatment. The distribution of fungal species in the CK rhizosphere was inversely correlated with OM ( Fig. 6 C). Similar patterns were observed for the impact of plant N-metabolizing compounds on endophytic bacteria and fungi. The CCA analysis focused on the distribution of active compounds associated with N metabolism in root endophytic microbial populations. The results showed that after S. chartreusis WZS021 treatment, the abundance of endophytic microbial communities (both bacterial and fungal) was positively correlated with all environmental parameters. Conversely, in the CK and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatments, there was a negative correlation between these variables and the number of endophytic microbes ( Fig. 6 B, D). Notably, GPT and GOT emerged as the primary contributors to these relationships among the influencing factors. 4 Discussion The chemical composition of soil profoundly influences microbial community structure and plant growth and development. These attributes serve as critical biological indicators of soil fertility ( Whittinghill and Hobbie, 2012 ). In our study, the inoculation of S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 actinomycete strains resulted in various increases in soil nutrients, with the exception of TN and AK. This rise in nutrient concentrations demonstrated the treatments' successful improvement of soil fertility, creating a favorable environment for typical plant growth and development. It is well-known that soil enzymes play a pivotal role in facilitating substance exchange between soil and plants ( Li et al., 2016 ). These enzymes are indispensable mediators in soil ecosystems as they actively participate in the metabolic cycles of energy and nutrients in the soil. Notably, soil enzyme activity provides a comprehensive assessment of nutrient reserves and the robustness of biochemical reactions within the soil system, which can indicate changes in microbial populations and soil improvement activities ( Liu et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2022 ). Our study highlighted the significant influence of the inoculation treatment on soil enzyme activities, particularly evident at 30 DAI. AKP, DHA, and urease were three crucial soil enzymes whose activity significantly increased during this period. These findings suggest that the inoculation process played a crucial role in modifying nutrient metabolism in the sugarcane rhizosphere soil, ultimately enhancing the environment for plant growth. Interestingly, soil enzyme activity can also serve as a valuable indicator of soil quality in the context of heavy metal stress ( Song et al., 2022 ). The activity of soil enzymes, particularly DHA, is a vital biomarker of soil microbial activity, as it responds to the biomass of living organisms in the soil. DHA is predominantly abundant in all living microbial cells and is directly linked to microbial redox processes ( Małachowska-Jutsz and Matyja, 2019 ). Our findings revealed that DHA activity in the rhizosphere of the soil was significantly influenced by the inoculation with S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 or S. chartreusis WZS021. This increase in enzyme activity implies a larger microbial population, subsequently supporting microbial redox activities in the rhizosphere. Urease, an essential hydrolytic enzyme crucial in the nitrogen metabolic cycle and the decomposition of urea in soil ( Cui et al., 2022 ), also exhibited noteworthy increases in activity in the rhizosphere soil after inoculation with WZS021. This indicates the positive role of this strain in nitrogen cycling and rhizosphere soil plant utilization. While BTU6 also led to an increase in urease activity, its effect was not as pronounced as that of WZS021. This finding underscores how actinomycete inoculation promotes the accumulation of enzymes and other active ingredients (SP, SS, and Nitrate N) involved in nitrogen metabolism, thereby enhancing nutrient cycling in sugarcane. Through the activation and decomposition of organic matter in the soil, soil enzymes release nutrients that plants can directly utilize. Soil enzyme activity indirectly reflects soil fertility ( Huang et al., 2017 ). Among these enzymes, AKP plays an essential role as a catalyst for converting organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphorus, which plants can readily absorb and utilize ( Wang et al., 2022 ). Notably, WZS021 and BTU6 do not possess the ability to solubilize phosphorus themselves ( Wang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021 ). However, inoculation promotes the transformation of inorganic phosphorus in the rhizosphere soil by affecting AKP, enriching rhizosphere inorganic phosphorus stocks and assisting plants in better absorbing and utilizing phosphorus. Microorganisms primarily inhabit OM-rich environments and play a vital role in soil biological activity ( Chen et al., 2020 ). They are pivotal forces in the transformation and utilization of soil nutrients, actively contributing to the decomposition of OM and the development of soil humus ( Yarwood, 2018 ). Elements in the soil, such as moisture, physicochemical properties, and enzyme activity, directly impact microbial community structure. These bacteria help preserve and enhance soil fertility by secreting secondary metabolites ( Tan et al., 2021 ). In our study, the most prevalent fungal groups were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota, while the dominant bacterial groups included Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria ( Fig. 3 A-D), aligning with previous research ( Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2020; Díaz-Cruz and Cassone, 2022 ). Interestingly, among endophytic bacteria, Bacteroides emerged as the dominant group, despite its relative rarity in the rhizospheric bacteria. Bacteroides are closely linked to the conversion of organic materials, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, which are vital components of the N cycle ( Michaud et al., 2009 ). This likely explains the enhanced nitrogen utilization by sugarcane following inoculation with S. chartreusis WZS021, as reported by Wang et al. (2017) . After treatment with S. chartreusis WZS021 diversity indices in rhizospheric soil significantly increased, indicating a positive impact on soil diversity. Notably, r-selected bacteria, such as proteobacteria, thrive in nutrient-rich environments, while K-selected bacteria like Acidobacteria prefer nutrient-poor conditions ( Fierer et al., 2007; Fierer et al., 2012 ). Actinomycete-treated rhizospheric soil showed a higher relative abundance of Acidobacteria than Proteobacteria, highlighting the successful enhancement of soil fertility through actinomycete inoculation. Interestingly, the prevalence of Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria was inversely correlated with the application of organic fertilizers ( Tian et al., 2015 ). Sun et al. (2014) suggested that Actinomycetes secrete bacteriocins, influencing the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi , possibly explaining our similar findings. It’s important to note that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria decreased after actinomycete application, possibly due to the secretion of bacteriocins by the inoculated strains which can inhibit the growth of related microbes and regulate the microbiota ( Wang et al., 2022 ). Our study's organization of the sugarcane rhizosphere bacterial community was somewhat comparable to that of Brazilian sugarcane ( Pisa et al., 2011 ), suggesting universality in the design of rhizosphere bacterial populations. The distribution of fungal communities in ecosystems is closely tied to soil N metabolism ( Cox et al., 2010 ). Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, which are primary OM decomposers, play critical roles in rhizosphere N recycling and plant growth ( Yelle et al., 2008 ). Inoculation with two Streptomyces strains inhibited the growth of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, but promoted the proliferation of unknown fungi. Therefore, the increased phylogenetic diversity in both treatments, compared to the CK, was largely attributed to these changes. Notably, despite the lower relative abundance of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, the inoculated soil maintained high nutrient levels, suggesting the potential presence of unidentified fungi with similar functions. We recommend using high-throughput sequencing techniques to gain insights into these unidentified species, followed by various culture techniques to determine their taxonomic status and roles. S. chartreusis WZS021, known for promoting N fixation and enhancing plant stress resilience, may be associated with the increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria within endophytic bacteria. Conversely, treatment with S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 elevated the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere and Fibrobacteres within endophytic bacteria, potentially bolstering disease resistance. Moreover, Gemmatimonas increased in prevalence, while the pathogen Xanthomonas exhibited reduced relative abundance. These findings emphasize the potential role of these bacterial strains in shaping microbial dynamics within the plant's ecosystem ( Timilsina et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Carotenoids, essential for improving plant photosynthesis and salt tolerance, are produced by the Gemmatimonas bacterium ( Takaichi et al., 2010 ). The relative abundance of Dechloromonas among endophytic bacteria noticeably increased following S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 treatment. In contrast, S. chartreusis WZS021-treated plants showed an increased relative abundance of Pseudomonas and a decrease in Hydrogenophaga . Additionally, Aspergillus became the predominant fungal strain among endophytes after S. chartreusis WZS021 treatment ( Fig. 7 ). Previous studies have suggested that Aspergillus can boost antioxidant activity and increase the release of plant phenolics ( Dulf et al., 2015; Dulf et al., 2016 ), contributing to improved drought resistance Wang et al. (2019) . These findings suggest that S. chartreusis WZS021's impact on microbial community structure could indirectly enhance plant drought resistance by influencing the composition and function of the endophytic fungal community's. While clear differences in microbial population composition existed between the control group (CK) and the two treatments, there was a stronger similarity between the two treatments, particularly in the endophytic microbial community. Importantly, there was no overlap in the distribution patterns of samples treated with S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 ( Fig. 4 ), indicating distinct microbial community compositions due to the functional differences between the two strains. In conclusion, inoculation altered the composition of the microbial community without changing the dominant groups. The CCA revealed a positive correlation between rhizospheric soil nutrient levels and post-inoculation bacterial abundance. Microbial populations increased significantly, closely associated with nutrient availability, as S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 improved soil nutrients. Fig. 3 C highlights a substantial increase in the relative abundance of unclassified fungal species in the rhizospheric soil following inoculation. These fungi may possess unique properties that enhance plant resilience and contribute to plant growth. It's crucial to remember that PGPS may indirectly affect plant growth by altering the microbial community’s composition. Nitrogen application alters microbial N cycle activities, including nitrification and N fixation, leading to changes in fungal communities in forest ecosystems ( Morrison et al., 2016 ). The enrichment of endophytic fungi after treatment with S. chartreusis WZS021 was positively linked to N-metabolizing enzymes and active compounds, indicating that this strain not only possesses N fixation ability but also influences plant N metabolism by endophytic fungal population. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between microbial communities and sugarcane plants following actinomycete inoculation, shedding light on their potential role in enhancing soil fertility and plant growth. Further research is warranted to explore the functional roles of specific microbial groups and their impact on plant health and productivity in greater detail.
