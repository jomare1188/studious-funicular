    "full_text": "The Australian sugarcane industry is facing a new threat of the currently undiagnosed Yellow Canopy Syndrome (YCS). Here, we investigated if YCS is linked to detrimental shifts in soil microbial function and/or altered physico-chemical soil properties. We examined changes in rhizosphere soil microbial assemblages, functional gene profiles and microbial activity associated with YCS development. Shifts in soil bacterial and fungal community assemblages with YCS appeared variety-specific with limited consistent trends emerging. However, significant, consistent shifts in the rhizosphere soil metagenome with YCS were found, suggesting that YCS incidence might be linked to changes in specific soil microbial functions. Functional gene categories involved in prokaryotic immune response and in metabolism of compounds present in root exudates were consistently detected in higher abundance in the rhizosphere of YCS-affected plants, while gene categories involved in DNA, RNA and protein processing were consistently less abundant. Soil nutrient status (C, N), extracellular enzyme activity and substrate-induced respiration either did not significantly differ between affected and healthy fields of three sugarcane varieties, or showed inconsistent trends with variety. Altogether, our results did not show a direct link between soil microbial richness, overall soil microbial activity, soil nutrient status and YCS incidence. However, rhizosphere microbial communities responded consistently to YCS incidence by enrichment of genes encoding functions involved in defence against pathogens and root exudate metabolism which may have potential implications for the future development of diagnostic tools and an effective management practice to minimise impact of YCS on farm productivity."

          "Farm yield decline is a complex issue caused by several factors including loss of soil health as a result of long-term monoculture, soil compaction due to extensive heavy machinery use, excessive tillage and other practices that depleted soil organic matter ( Garside et al., 2005 ; Kibblewhite et al., 2008 ). Soil health, encompassing soil physical, chemical and biological components, is critical for sustaining plant productivity ( Kibblewhite et al., 2008 ; Trivedi et al., 2016a ; Zhu et al., 2016 ). It is well established that soil microbiota play a key role in plant health and productivity through beneficial plant-microbe interactions such as nutrient supply, growth promotion and disease suppression (e.g., Mendes et al., 2011 ; Schmalenberger et al., 2008 ). However, soil microbes are sensitive to land management practices and other environmental changes and intricately linked to soil physico-chemical health. Therefore, it is not surprising that the ultimate expression of sugarcane yield decline in Australia was reported through adverse effects of pathogens on sugarcane root systems ( Garside et al., 2005 ).",
          "The Australian sugarcane industry has experienced declining yields during the past few decades ( Garside et al., 2005 ) and, in addition, is now facing a serious threat of Yellow Canopy Syndrome (YCS). YCS is a largely undiagnosed condition impacting sugarcane crops (Saccharum spp. hybrids) across Queensland, Australia, causing significant yield losses ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). Key YCS symptoms are a typical leaf yellowing that differs from symptoms due to drought stress, phytotoxicity, insect attack, known diseases, nutrient deficiency or natural maturation. Since the first observation of YCS in 2011, the condition has spread to all major cane growing areas and is a critical issue for the industry. Despite elimination of some potential causes, such as known Australian sugarcane pathogens, the causal agent of YCS remains unknown ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). This raised the question whether YCS is a consequence of reduced soil health, due to altered physico-chemical soil properties and/or detrimental shifts in soil microbial functions. YCS is associated with a typical yellowing of sugarcane leaves (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ), instigated by an increase in leaf sucrose levels triggering reduced leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and disruption of the electron transport chain ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). The condition affects all varieties of sugarcane in Australia and appears to occur periodically from December onwards (Australian summer). A particular field site can thus be affected by YCS multiple times throughout the growing season, resulting in significant crop losses. Although YCS is yet to be reported from other sugarcane producing regions of the world, recent history with other plant diseases ( Wang and Trivedi, 2013 ; Lang et al., 2017 ) suggests that YCS might quickly spread to other continents. Given the high global demand for sugar and biofuel, finding management strategies is critical to minimise YCS-linked productivity losses.",
          "Healthy microbiomes can protect crops from biotic and abiotic stresses ( Busby et al., 2017 ; Singh and Trivedi, 2017 ; Mendes et al., 2011 ). However, the key first steps required to harness microbiomes for reduced plant stress include (1) defining a healthy microbiome and comparative knowledge to distinguish it from a stressed plant microbiome, and (2) identifying the key microbial functional gene categories that drive differences between microbiomes of healthy and stressed plants. Therefore, understanding if and how the rhizosphere functional microbial community responds to YCS could provide important data that in the long-term might result in the development of diagnostic tools and identification of potential management strategies for YCS, including an improved microbiome-assisted breeding program, or a better prediction of management outcomes.",
          "In this study, we hypothesised that YCS incidence promotes a loss of specific microbial mediated functions involved in nutrient cycling and plant disease suppression, and that these shifts result in a decline of overall soil nutritional health. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the response of the rhizosphere soil metagenome and functions to YCS occurrence. Our study had four interlinked objectives: (1) to systematically determine shifts in rhizosphere soil microbial assemblages with YCS incidence in three sugarcane varieties; (2) to examine changes in the rhizosphere soil metagenome and specific functional gene categories associated with YCS development; (3) to determine if soils of YCS symptomatic fields contained consistently lower amounts of essential soil nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen compared to asymptomatic fields; and (4) to investigate if soil microbial activity (as determined by soil extracellular enzyme activities and substrate-induced respiration) was lower in fields impacted by YCS. For this purpose, we collected rhizosphere soil samples from both asymptomatic and YCS symptomatic fields of three sugarcane varieties (Saccharum spp. hybrids KQ228 A , MQ239 and Q240 A ) near Ingham in the Herbert growing region (Queensland, Australia) and assessed their physico-chemical properties, microbial community profiles, functional gene profiles and certain soil functions."

              "Rhizosphere soil samples were collected from eight sugarcane fields growing three sugarcane varieties (Saccharum spp. hybrids KQ228 A , MQ239 and Q240 A ) near Ingham, Queensland, Australia in November 2014 ( Table S1 ). The sugarcane crop was in tillering phase at the time. For each sugarcane variety, field sites with typical YCS symptoms were carefully selected, as well as appropriate asymptomatic control fields of the same variety in close proximity, grown in the same soil type and under a similar management regime. In each asymptomatic field, three sugarcane clumps (stools) with healthy, green canopies were randomly selected, while in each YCS symptomatic field three stools with typical YCS symptoms were chosen. To remove potential edge effects, stools were not selected in the outer two sugarcane rows of a field. Stools were excavated from the soil, and rhizosphere soil samples were collected from underneath each stool. Rhizosphere soil was collected in two ways: (1) as the soil still attached to the roots after manually shaking them to remove loosely attached soil aggregates (duplicate samples per stool for molecular analysis); and (2) as the soil immediately underneath each excavated stool (one replicate per stool for molecular analysis, physico-chemical analyses and microbial activity measurements). Rhizosphere soil samples for molecular analysis (8 fields × 3 stools × 3 replicates: 72 in total) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen on the field, transported to the laboratory on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Rhizosphere soil samples collected for physico-chemical analysis and soil functional measurements (8 fields × 3 stools: 24 in total) were collected in zip-lock bags, cooled on the field and stored at 4 °C in the laboratory until analysis. For this study, we focused on rhizosphere soil microbial communities as these are considered to play the most significant role on the overall fitness of plants ( Busby et al., 2017 ; Singh and Trivedi, 2017 )."

Remaining primer sequences were removed from the resulting reads using SEQTK, and a further round of quality control was conducted in mothur ( Schloss et al., 2009 ) to discard short sequences (<380 bp for 16S and <150 bp for ITS), as well as sequences with ambiguous characters or more than 8 homopolymers. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were built at 97% sequence similarity using UPARSE ( Edgar, 2013 ). Singletons were discarded, as well as chimeric sequences identified by the UCHIME algorithm using the recommended SILVA gold 16S rRNA gene or UNITE reference databases for bacteria and fungi, respectively ( Edgar et al., 2011 ).

Aliquots of the soil slurries were then loaded into deep 96-well microplates, before being dispensed into Nunc™ 96-well black microplates (ThermoFisher, Australia), in the volume of 200 μL per well. Prior to adding the soil suspensions, 50 μL of 200 μM substrate solution was added to each sample well. Negative control wells received 50 μL of substrate solution and 200 μL of acetate buffer. Standard curves were included in each microplate, consisting of 250 μL of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μM MUB standard solutions. For each MUB substrate and for each soil sample tested, both blank and quench control wells were set up. Blank wells received 50 μL of acetate buffer and 200 μL of soil suspension. Quench control wells received 50 μL of standard (100 μM MUB) and 200 μL of either soil suspension or acetate buffer. Microplates were incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 3 h. Then, 10 μL of 0.25M NaOH solution was added to all wells to inhibit the reaction and maximise fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence was measured immediately afterwards at 365 nm excitation and 450 nm emission using a spectrophotometer microplate reader (EnSpire ® 2300 Multilabel Reader, Perkin Elmer, USA). Values were corrected for controls and quenching, and enzyme activities were expressed in units of nmol h −1 g −1 soil dry weight.

The tested C sources for respiration ( Table S2 ) covered a range of low molecular weight compounds including sugars, amino acids and carboxylic acids that are commonly detected in root exudates ( Campbell et al., 1997 ), providing an assay that assessed the ability of the rhizosphere soil microbial community to utilise simple C sources. In addition, two more complex substrates, cellulose and lignin, the main structural components of plant cell walls ( Houston et al., 2016 ), were included to assess the ability of the sugarcane soils to degrade more complex compounds. The respiratory response to addition of sterile, deionised water (basal respiration) and seven carbon sources (substrate-induced respiration; Table S2 ) was measured in triplicate for rhizosphere soil collected under each sugarcane stool. All carbon sources were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Australia). Sieved (<2 mm) soil (∼0.4 g per well) was delivered to deep-well microplates, brought to a soil moisture content of 15% and pre-incubated at 25 °C for 48 h prior to the respiration assay. Each carbon source was dissolved in sterile, deionised water and prepared as a stock solution at a concentration designed to deliver the indicated carbon content per gram of soil water ( Table S2 ) in each deep well when 25 μL was dispensed. Immediately prior to adding the carbon sources, CO 2 detection plates were read on a spectrophotometer microplate reader at 570 nm (EnSpire ® 2300 Multilabel Reader, Perkin Elmer, USA). After addition of the substrates, the deep-well plates were sealed with the pre-read CO 2 detection plates and incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 6 h. The change in colour of the detection plate after incubation was measured using the spectrophotometer, and the rate of CO 2 respiration expressed per gram of soil per well was calculated using the formula provided in the MicroResp™ manual (Macaulay Scientific Consulting, UK).

The ANOVA function of the car package ( Fox and Weisberg, 2011 ) was used after square-root, log or log-normal transformation of the variables for normalization, if required. For significant effects (P < 0.05), post-hoc pairwise comparisons were performed in R using the multcomp and lsmeans packages ( Hothorn et al., 2008 ; Lenth, 2016 ). Given that the enzyme activity and soil respiration data were not normally distributed (even after log-normal or square-root transformation), Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests ( Hollander and Wolfe, 1973 ) were applied to determine significant one-way effects of variety and YCS. Dunn tests were performed for post-hoc pairwise comparisons ( Dunn, 1964 ) between all variety × YCS combinations (n = 6), accounting for false discovery rates ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ). This allowed the determination of YCS effects on soil extracellular enzyme activities and substrate-induced respiration for each variety.",
              "Rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal assemblages were analysed using PRIMER-E Ltd software version 6 (Plymouth, UK). Resemblance matrices for community profiles were constructed by calculating similarities between each pair of samples using the Bray-Curtis coefficient after standardization by sample total and square root transformation ( Clarke and Warwick, 2001 ). To study a potential effect of the rhizosphere soil collection method (soil collected attached to roots vs. soil collected underneath excavated stools) on bacterial and fungal assemblages within each sugarcane field, one-way ANOSIM was applied ( Clarke, 1993 ). Bacterial and fungal assemblages of rhizosphere soils collected directly from roots did not differ from rhizosphere soils collected underneath excavated stools. Significant differences due to rhizosphere soil collection method were only found for bacterial assemblages in one field site (site I2, ANOSIM R = 0.815, P = 0.018) and for fungal assemblages in two of the eight field sites (site I2, R = 1, P = 0.018; site I7, R = 0.833, P = 0.029). Therefore, all rhizosphere soil samples were collectively analysed for variety and YCS effects. Permutation-based multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA; 999 permutations; Anderson, 2001 ) was applied to test the effects of sugarcane variety and YCS using a two-way crossed variety × YCS design. For significant PERMANOVA test results (P < 0.05), principal coordinates analysis (PCO; Gower, 1966 ) was used to visualize the differences in community assemblages. The individual contribution of bacterial and fungal OTUs to differences in the rhizosphere soil community assemblages with YCS was further explored using the SIMPER routine of PRIMER-E Ltd software version 6 (Plymouth, UK). To determine the relative importance of the effects of sugarcane variety and YCS on rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal community assemblages, variation partitioning was carried out to estimate the individual versus combined effects of the explanatory factors on the bacterial and fungal community assemblages, as described by Anderson and Gribble (1998) . The significance of each effect was tested by 999 random permutations using the DISTLM procedure ( McArdle and Anderson, 2001 ) of PRIMER-E Ltd software version 6 (Plymouth, UK).

Other highly abundant functional gene categories were involved in C metabolism (central carbohydrate metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, monosaccharides, di-and oligosaccharides), DNA and RNA processing, protein biosynthesis, and resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds ( Fig. 4 A), all functions to be expected in the challenging rhizosphere environment where micro-organisms interact with sugarcane roots.",
              "Sugarcane variety (P perm = 0.001) and YCS (P perm = 0.013) both significantly affected the functional gene profile of rhizosphere soils ( Fig. 4 B). However, no significant variety by YCS interaction effect was found (P perm = 0.085; Fig. 4 B). Twenty one functional gene categories (from SEED subsystems level 2 classification) significantly differed in relative abundance with YCS incidence and showed consistent trends in their relative abundance with YCS for each studied sugarcane variety ( Fig. 5 ). The nine functional gene categories that were found depleted in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants are involved in DNA and RNA processing, protein biosynthesis and translocation, and ATP synthesis ( Fig. 5 ), which might reflect a reduced, basal cellular activity of the rhizosphere microbiome with YCS incidence. In contrast, twelve functional gene categories were detected in higher abundance in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants ( Fig. 5 ). These functional gene categories appear involved in five broad functions in the rhizosphere soil: prokaryotic immune response (bacterial cytostatics, differentiation factors and antibiotics, CRISPs, CRISPRs and associated hypotheticals), metabolism of root exudates (anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds, biotin, catabolism of aromatic compounds, fatty acid metabolic cluster, fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, biotin), methanogenesis (co-enzyme F420), cell division (cytochrome biogenesis) and rhizosphere and/or root colonization (biosynthesis of galactoglycans and associated lipopolysaccharides).",
              "The specific functions related to the functional gene categories that were significantly and consistently enriched or depleted in the rhizosphere of YCS-affected plants were not tested in this study. Instead, we measured the activity of several extracellular enzymes involved in metabolism of simple and more complex carbon substrates in rhizosphere soil (section 3.4 ). For all genes encoding the studied enzymes, their relative abundance in the rhizosphere soils of YCS-affected fields did not significantly differ from their relative abundance in rhizosphere soil from the corresponding asymptomatic control fields ( Table S6 ). This is in agreement with the lack of significant and consistent trends in the corresponding enzyme activities with YCS incidence (section 3.4 )."

Indeed, for each individual variety, extracellular enzyme activities decreased with YCS incidence, but this reduction in activity was only significant for all three varieties for chitinase, and not the other five enzymes ( Table S7 ). Correspondingly, the sum of the activities of all six studied enzymes combined was lower in YCS symptomatic compared to control fields for all three varieties, but this YCS effect was only significant for varieties KQ228 A and MQ239 and not for Q240 A ( Figure 6 A, Table S7 ).",

              "We observed that YCS incidence significantly influenced rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal community assemblages, but not bacterial and fungal richness. Relatively few studies to date have examined the influence of plant disease on the diversity of the plant-associated microbial community ( Gardener and Weller, 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ; Araujo et al., 2002 ; Reiter et al., 2002 ; Filion et al., 2004 ; Trivedi et al., 2010 , 2011 ). Similar to the results of our study, Filion et al. (2004) have reported negative effects of root rot disease on the stability of the rhizosphere bacterial community of black spruce (Picea mariana) seedlings. Shifts in the fungal community composition in response to pathogen infection have also been observed ( Filion et al., 2004 ; Vujanovic et al., 2007 ). In contrast to our findings with YCS, some studies have reported an increase in bacterial diversity associated with infested plants ( Yang et al., 2001 ; Reiter et al., 2002 ). We postulate that the nature of the observed fluctuations in the structure and function of the plant-associated microbial community would be differentially determined by the virulence mechanism(s) of the pathogen and the response of host plant to disease infection along with soil edaphic factors.",
              "Several culture-independent studies examining bacterial diversity in various ecological niches have provided evidence that shifts in microbial community composition underlie states of host health and disease ( Araújo et al., 2002 ; Sagaram et al., 2009 ; Tyler et al., 2009 ; Trivedi et al., 2010 ). Our study did not detect an overwhelming dominance by a single microbial species in YCS symptomatic samples. We detected shifts in rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal community assemblages with YCS, but significant variety × YCS interaction effects were observed. The main contributors to the measured YCS effects on the bacterial and fungal communities showed inconsistent trends between the three studied varieties, with some exceptions for bacteria. This finding is supported by a recent study that reported a shift in core endophytic microbiomes of leaf, stalk and root of YCS-affected sugarcane plants ( Hamonts et al., 2018 ). Indeed, we did observe an increase in the relative abundance of certain bacterial OTUs (unclassified bacteria belonging to the Rhodoplanes genus and the Koribacteracea and Actinosynnemataceae families) in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic compared to asymptomatic plants of all varieties. Although not tested in this study, it may be speculated that YCS is a consequence of imbalances in the resident microflora based on the “Ecological Hypothesis”. According to this theory, it is likely that many pathogens did not initially evolve as pathogens, but simply take on this role as a result of a lack of ability of the host to maintain homeostasis. The YCS-associated OTUs might exemplify such imbalances in the rhizosphere bacterial community of sugarcane. On the other hand, these YCS-associated OTUs (see Table S4 &S5) may represent promising candidates for investigating and tracking YCS progression and could provide candidate biomarkers for early YCS detection. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we are not able to conclude from our results whether an increased relative abundance of different bacteria is the cause or rather the result of YCS. Alternatively, colonization by opportunistic pathogens or uncontrolled growth of commensals may have taken advantage of a compromised host immune system caused by a primary agent and/or unfavourable environmental conditions. To date, the biotic and/or abiotic causal agent(s) of YCS remain to be determined and further detailed studies based on comparing the functional microbiome of YCS symptomatic plants under various stages of YCS development are required."

              "In contrast to microbial (phylogenetic) community response, we observed significant and consistent changes in the relative abundance of particular soil microbial functional gene categories in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants compared to asymptomatic control plants. This is in agreement with a previous study that reported significant changes in the functional potential of the rhizosphere microbiome of citrus infected with huanglogbing ( Trivedi et al., 2012 ). Below we discuss the various functional gene categories that showed consistent differences in relative abundance in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic versus asymptomatic control plants for the three studied varieties. A change in these functional gene abundances might imply a change in the associated rhizosphere functions with YCS.",
              "Several studies have reported that the composition of the rhizosphere microbial community is related to the diversity of nutrients and plant secondary metabolites present in root exudates ( Dakora and Phillips, 2002 ; Matilla et al. 2010 ; Jones et al., 2009 ; Trivedi et al., 2012 ). We observed that various functional genes involved in root exudate metabolism were enriched in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants compared to asymptomatic sugarcane. Although root exudates were not analysed in our study, introduction of phytopathogens and non-native bacteria along with abiotic stresses have been shown to change the amount and composition of organic acids, sugars and other essential nutrients in root exudates ( Phillips et al., 2004 ; Kamilova et al., 2006 ; Neumann and Römheld, 2007 ). YCS is known to cause carbohydrate partitioning imbalances throughout the plant wherein much higher levels of starch are observed in the leaves, whereas the roots are depleted of any starch ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). We hypothesize that alterations in plant physiology leading to quantitative and qualitative changes in partitioning of the photoassimilates is primarily responsible for the selection of traits involved in metabolism of these altered root exudate compounds in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants.",
              "CRISPR–Cas systems confer adaptive immunity against exogenic elements in bacteria and archaea and are a major line of prokaryotic defense based on the self-non-self discrimination principle, which recognizes and targets foreign DNA ( Makarova et al., 2013 ). Our comparison of microbial metagenomes revealed that such bacterial defense systems were consistently more abundant in YCS symptomatic compared to asymptomatic sugarcane rhizosphere metagenomes. CRISPR-Cas systems have been reported to be enriched in the rhizosphere of barley ( Bulgarelli et al., 2015 ) and beech ( Colin et al., 2017 ), suggesting that this may be a common trait of rhizosphere bacterial communities.",
              "Genes involved in the biosynthesis of structural exopolysaccharides such as galactoglycans and lipopolysaccharides were enriched in YCS symptomatic sugarcane rhizosphere metagenomes. These compounds represent a class of virulence factors shielding bacteria from adverse host environments and to circumvent the host's surveillance and defence systems ( Ranf et al., 2016 ). These compounds can additionally be modified for adaptation to changing environments encountered during host colonization ( Ranf, 2016 ). Interestingly, genes involved in the transport of various capsular polysaccharides were reported to be significantly higher in pathogens as compared to plant symbionts, rhizosphere or bulk soil bacteria ( Hardoim et al., 2015 ). Although, this study did not characterise changes in the root exudation patterns in response to YCS incidence, it can be argued that YCS may promote specific microbial groups with a better ability to synthesize and metabolize complex polysaccharides. These recruitments can potentially result in altered immune responses in the plant host leading to an overall decline in health, performance, and stress tolerance.",
              "We detected significant enrichments of various genes involved in anaerobic processes such as degradation of aromatic compounds and methanogenesis in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants. Water transport is impaired in YCS symptomatic plants ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ) which could result in a relatively higher soil water content in the rhizosphere of symptomatic plants. This, in combination with a potentially higher carbohydrate content (as a result of the higher sugar content of YCS symptomatic plants some of which is likely to be exuded into the rhizosphere soil), might result in a relatively higher rate of oxygen consumption in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants, resulting in more anaerobic conditions. However, we have no evidence to support this hypothesis. We also observed that genes associated with DNA/RNA/protein metabolism and ATP synthesis were depleted in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants, suggesting a reduced basal activity of the rhizosphere microbiota. Trivedi et al. (2012) have reported an increased abundance of slow growing microbes in the rhizosphere of citrus infected with huanglongbing that is related to changes in the relative abundance of various genes involved in nutrient acquisition. Our study indicates a possible link between YCS, root exudation and enrichment of rhizosphere microbiota with specific traits involved in anaerobic metabolism, root exudate metabolism and prokaryotic immune response that impacts the normal functioning of the rhizosphere microbiome, most likely in response to changes in plant physiology of the sugarcane host. Alternatively, the observed changes in the rhizosphere metagenome might result in a stress response in the host."

              "We did not detect significant, consistent changes in the tested physico-chemical soil properties with YCS incidence. Our results therefore suggest that nutrient content was not directly linked to YCS development. This is in agreement with previous observations that YCS development was not related to deficiencies of N, Fe or other mineral nutrients ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). Extracellular enzyme activity and substrate-induced respiration assays, which are considered as reliable and sensitive proxies for soil functions, in particular decomposition rates ( Trivedi et al., 2016 , 2017 ), demonstrated lower but statistically non-significant soil enzyme activities and respiration rates in YCS symptomatic compared to corresponding asymptomatic fields, except for chitinase activity. Combined with above and lack of response in rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal abundance, our study indicates that the lower activities measured in soils from YCS symptomatic fields were not due to lower numbers of bacteria and fungi. Moreover, no differences in relative abundance of the functional genes encoding the studied enzymes were observed in the studied rhizosphere soil samples. However, specific functions other than the tested enzyme activities and substrate-induced soil respiration might alter with YCS.",
              "In conclusion, the results of our study show that YCS could play an important role in re-structuring the composition and function of the rhizosphere microbiome. These fluctuations might result from the fact that YCS compromises the plant defence and alters root exudation patterns. Moreover, we detected significant depletion of microbial functions involved in DNA/RNA/protein processing but no depletion in specific functions involved in nutrient acquisition, as hypothesised. However, we identified consistent enrichment in the relative abundance of functional genes encoding for defence against pathogens and for metabolism of root exudates in the rhizosphere of YCS affected plants, which might reflect a defence response against a pathogen or the response of a stressed plant. Additionally, our study contributes in fulfilling a key knowledge gap on the consistent response of microbial functional metagenomes from different crop varieties under stress. By identifying key phylogenetic taxa and specific functional genes that consistently responded to YCS incidence, this study provides initial data for future investigation into development of YCS diagnostic tools and effective YCS management strategies."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Farm yield decline is a complex issue caused by several factors including loss of soil health as a result of long-term monoculture, soil compaction due to extensive heavy machinery use, excessive tillage and other practices that depleted soil organic matter ( Garside et al., 2005 ; Kibblewhite et al., 2008 ). Soil health, encompassing soil physical, chemical and biological components, is critical for sustaining plant productivity ( Kibblewhite et al., 2008 ; Trivedi et al., 2016a ; Zhu et al., 2016 ). It is well established that soil microbiota play a key role in plant health and productivity through beneficial plant-microbe interactions such as nutrient supply, growth promotion and disease suppression (e.g., Mendes et al., 2011 ; Schmalenberger et al., 2008 ). However, soil microbes are sensitive to land management practices and other environmental changes and intricately linked to soil physico-chemical health. Therefore, it is not surprising that the ultimate expression of sugarcane yield decline in Australia was reported through adverse effects of pathogens on sugarcane root systems ( Garside et al., 2005 ). The Australian sugarcane industry has experienced declining yields during the past few decades ( Garside et al., 2005 ) and, in addition, is now facing a serious threat of Yellow Canopy Syndrome (YCS). YCS is a largely undiagnosed condition impacting sugarcane crops (Saccharum spp. hybrids) across Queensland, Australia, causing significant yield losses ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). Key YCS symptoms are a typical leaf yellowing that differs from symptoms due to drought stress, phytotoxicity, insect attack, known diseases, nutrient deficiency or natural maturation. Since the first observation of YCS in 2011, the condition has spread to all major cane growing areas and is a critical issue for the industry. Despite elimination of some potential causes, such as known Australian sugarcane pathogens, the causal agent of YCS remains unknown ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). This raised the question whether YCS is a consequence of reduced soil health, due to altered physico-chemical soil properties and/or detrimental shifts in soil microbial functions. YCS is associated with a typical yellowing of sugarcane leaves (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ), instigated by an increase in leaf sucrose levels triggering reduced leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and disruption of the electron transport chain ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). The condition affects all varieties of sugarcane in Australia and appears to occur periodically from December onwards (Australian summer). A particular field site can thus be affected by YCS multiple times throughout the growing season, resulting in significant crop losses. Although YCS is yet to be reported from other sugarcane producing regions of the world, recent history with other plant diseases ( Wang and Trivedi, 2013 ; Lang et al., 2017 ) suggests that YCS might quickly spread to other continents. Given the high global demand for sugar and biofuel, finding management strategies is critical to minimise YCS-linked productivity losses. Healthy microbiomes can protect crops from biotic and abiotic stresses ( Busby et al., 2017 ; Singh and Trivedi, 2017 ; Mendes et al., 2011 ). However, the key first steps required to harness microbiomes for reduced plant stress include (1) defining a healthy microbiome and comparative knowledge to distinguish it from a stressed plant microbiome, and (2) identifying the key microbial functional gene categories that drive differences between microbiomes of healthy and stressed plants. Therefore, understanding if and how the rhizosphere functional microbial community responds to YCS could provide important data that in the long-term might result in the development of diagnostic tools and identification of potential management strategies for YCS, including an improved microbiome-assisted breeding program, or a better prediction of management outcomes. In this study, we hypothesised that YCS incidence promotes a loss of specific microbial mediated functions involved in nutrient cycling and plant disease suppression, and that these shifts result in a decline of overall soil nutritional health. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the response of the rhizosphere soil metagenome and functions to YCS occurrence. Our study had four interlinked objectives: (1) to systematically determine shifts in rhizosphere soil microbial assemblages with YCS incidence in three sugarcane varieties; (2) to examine changes in the rhizosphere soil metagenome and specific functional gene categories associated with YCS development; (3) to determine if soils of YCS symptomatic fields contained consistently lower amounts of essential soil nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen compared to asymptomatic fields; and (4) to investigate if soil microbial activity (as determined by soil extracellular enzyme activities and substrate-induced respiration) was lower in fields impacted by YCS. For this purpose, we collected rhizosphere soil samples from both asymptomatic and YCS symptomatic fields of three sugarcane varieties (Saccharum spp. hybrids KQ228 A , MQ239 and Q240 A ) near Ingham in the Herbert growing region (Queensland, Australia) and assessed their physico-chemical properties, microbial community profiles, functional gene profiles and certain soil functions. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sample collection Rhizosphere soil samples were collected from eight sugarcane fields growing three sugarcane varieties (Saccharum spp. hybrids KQ228 A , MQ239 and Q240 A ) near Ingham, Queensland, Australia in November 2014 ( Table S1 ). The sugarcane crop was in tillering phase at the time. For each sugarcane variety, field sites with typical YCS symptoms were carefully selected, as well as appropriate asymptomatic control fields of the same variety in close proximity, grown in the same soil type and under a similar management regime. In each asymptomatic field, three sugarcane clumps (stools) with healthy, green canopies were randomly selected, while in each YCS symptomatic field three stools with typical YCS symptoms were chosen. To remove potential edge effects, stools were not selected in the outer two sugarcane rows of a field. Stools were excavated from the soil, and rhizosphere soil samples were collected from underneath each stool. Rhizosphere soil was collected in two ways: (1) as the soil still attached to the roots after manually shaking them to remove loosely attached soil aggregates (duplicate samples per stool for molecular analysis); and (2) as the soil immediately underneath each excavated stool (one replicate per stool for molecular analysis, physico-chemical analyses and microbial activity measurements). Rhizosphere soil samples for molecular analysis (8 fields × 3 stools × 3 replicates: 72 in total) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen on the field, transported to the laboratory on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Rhizosphere soil samples collected for physico-chemical analysis and soil functional measurements (8 fields × 3 stools: 24 in total) were collected in zip-lock bags, cooled on the field and stored at 4 °C in the laboratory until analysis. For this study, we focused on rhizosphere soil microbial communities as these are considered to play the most significant role on the overall fitness of plants ( Busby et al., 2017 ; Singh and Trivedi, 2017 ). 2.2 DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing, quantitative PCR DNA was extracted from the 72 rhizosphere soil samples collected for molecular analysis ( Table S1 ) using the MoBIO PowerSoil ® DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. For all 72 soil DNA extracts, amplicons targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (341F-805R, Herlemann et al., 2011 ) and the fungal ITS2 region (FITS7-ITS4R, Ihrmark et al., 2012 ) were sequenced at the Western Sydney University NGS facility (Sydney, Australia) using Illumina ® MiSeq 2 × 300 bp paired end sequencing. Raw amplicon sequence data related to this study are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under Bioprojects PRJNA390435 (bacteria) and PRJNA390436 (fungi). Shotgun metagenomics was performed on 24 selected rhizosphere samples (one sample from each of the three sampled stools per field site) at the Western Sydney University NGS facility (Sydney, Australia). Rhizosphere soil DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina ® Nextera DNA sample preparation kit, and the libraries were paired-end sequenced on three lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 producing 125 bp read lengths. Raw sequence data were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive under accession numbers PRJEB9951 and ERP011107. Bacterial and fungal abundance in the rhizosphere soil samples selected for shotgun sequencing was estimated by qPCR of the bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal 18S rRNA genes. For amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA, primer set Ba519f/Ba907r was used with protocol described earlier ( Lueders et al., 2004a ). For fungal abundance, the 18S rRNA primer set fun5f/FF390r was used with protocol described by Lueders et al. (2004b) . The qPCR products were amplified using a Rotor-GeneQ5plex Platform system (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). 2.3 Processing of amplicon sequence data The quality of all Illumina R1 and R2 reads was assessed using FastQC ( Andrews, 2010 ), low quality regions (Q < 20) were trimmed from the 5’ end of the sequences using SEQTK ( https://github.com/lh3/seqtk ), and the paired ends were subsequently joined using FLASH ( Magoc and Salzberg, 2011 ). Remaining primer sequences were removed from the resulting reads using SEQTK, and a further round of quality control was conducted in mothur ( Schloss et al., 2009 ) to discard short sequences (<380 bp for 16S and <150 bp for ITS), as well as sequences with ambiguous characters or more than 8 homopolymers. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were built at 97% sequence similarity using UPARSE ( Edgar, 2013 ). Singletons were discarded, as well as chimeric sequences identified by the UCHIME algorithm using the recommended SILVA gold 16S rRNA gene or UNITE reference databases for bacteria and fungi, respectively ( Edgar et al., 2011 ). OTU abundance tables were constructed by running the usearch_global command ( http://www.drive5.com/ ). Taxonomy was assigned to OTUs in mothur using the naïve Bayesian classifier ( Wang et al., 2007 ) with a minimum bootstrap support of 60% and the Greengenes database version 13_8 ( DeSantis et al., 2006 ; McDonald et al., 2012 ) for bacteria or the dynamic UNITE version 6 dataset ( Kõljalg et al., 2013 ) for fungi. The resulting OTU abundance tables were subsequently rarefied using mothur ( Schloss et al., 2009 ) to 24,256 (bacteria) and 52,992 (fungi) sequences per sample, corresponding to the minimum number of sequences for a single rhizosphere soil sample, respectively. Alpha diversity metrics were subsequently determined in mothur ( Schloss et al., 2009 ). 2.4 Processing of rhizosphere soil metagenomics data Shotgun metagenomics produced between 14.6 and 23.8 million raw sequence reads per sample. Analysis of rhizosphere soil metagenomes was performed through the metagenomics RAST server using default parameters ( Meyer et al., 2008 ). For each sample, the abundance of individual sequences matching SEED subsystem level 2 (groups of genes involved in a particular metabolic function; Overbeek et al., 2005 ) was obtained, normalised by sequencing effort and used to generate a functional profile of the rhizosphere soils. 2.5 Soil physico-chemical properties Soils were sieved (<2 mm) prior to analysis. Soil moisture was measured gravimetrically by drying overnight at 105 °C. Soil pH was determined in a 1:2.5 water suspension ( Blakemore et al., 1987 ). Total carbon (TC) and nitrogen (TN) in soil were determined by combustion on a LECO macro-CN analyser (LECO, St Joseph, MI, USA). Available C (total dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic (DIC) carbon) and N (dissolved nitrogen, DN) were measured on 1:5 soil:water extracts with a High TOC II analyser (Elementar, Germany). 2.6 Soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) Activities of extracellular enzymes were assessed according to Saiya-Cork et al. (2002) and Sinsabaugh et al. (2003) . Six assays were performed to assess the activities of α-1,4-glucosidase, β-1,4-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, chitinase, β-xylosidase and acid phosphatase using the substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl (MUB)-α- d -glucopyranoside, 4-MUB-β- d -glucopyranoside, 4-MUB-β-D-cellobioside, 4-MUB- N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminide, 4-MUB- N -acetyl-β- d -xylopyranoside and 4-MUB-phosphate, respectively. All substrates were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Australia). One gram of fresh soil was homogenised in 33 mL of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer by shaking it for 20 min at 200 rpm. Aliquots of the soil slurries were then loaded into deep 96-well microplates, before being dispensed into Nunc™ 96-well black microplates (ThermoFisher, Australia), in the volume of 200 μL per well. Prior to adding the soil suspensions, 50 μL of 200 μM substrate solution was added to each sample well. Negative control wells received 50 μL of substrate solution and 200 μL of acetate buffer. Standard curves were included in each microplate, consisting of 250 μL of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μM MUB standard solutions. For each MUB substrate and for each soil sample tested, both blank and quench control wells were set up. Blank wells received 50 μL of acetate buffer and 200 μL of soil suspension. Quench control wells received 50 μL of standard (100 μM MUB) and 200 μL of either soil suspension or acetate buffer. Microplates were incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 3 h. Then, 10 μL of 0.25M NaOH solution was added to all wells to inhibit the reaction and maximise fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence was measured immediately afterwards at 365 nm excitation and 450 nm emission using a spectrophotometer microplate reader (EnSpire ® 2300 Multilabel Reader, Perkin Elmer, USA). Values were corrected for controls and quenching, and enzyme activities were expressed in units of nmol h −1 g −1 soil dry weight. Each rhizosphere soil was assessed in triplicate (three soil suspensions per sample) and per soil suspension, eight replicate wells were examined for each substrate. 2.7 Soil basal and substrate-induced respiration Soil respiration was assessed using the MicroResp™ CO 2 detection system ( Campbell et al., 2003 ). The tested C sources for respiration ( Table S2 ) covered a range of low molecular weight compounds including sugars, amino acids and carboxylic acids that are commonly detected in root exudates ( Campbell et al., 1997 ), providing an assay that assessed the ability of the rhizosphere soil microbial community to utilise simple C sources. In addition, two more complex substrates, cellulose and lignin, the main structural components of plant cell walls ( Houston et al., 2016 ), were included to assess the ability of the sugarcane soils to degrade more complex compounds. The respiratory response to addition of sterile, deionised water (basal respiration) and seven carbon sources (substrate-induced respiration; Table S2 ) was measured in triplicate for rhizosphere soil collected under each sugarcane stool. All carbon sources were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Australia). Sieved (<2 mm) soil (∼0.4 g per well) was delivered to deep-well microplates, brought to a soil moisture content of 15% and pre-incubated at 25 °C for 48 h prior to the respiration assay. Each carbon source was dissolved in sterile, deionised water and prepared as a stock solution at a concentration designed to deliver the indicated carbon content per gram of soil water ( Table S2 ) in each deep well when 25 μL was dispensed. Immediately prior to adding the carbon sources, CO 2 detection plates were read on a spectrophotometer microplate reader at 570 nm (EnSpire ® 2300 Multilabel Reader, Perkin Elmer, USA). After addition of the substrates, the deep-well plates were sealed with the pre-read CO 2 detection plates and incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 6 h. The change in colour of the detection plate after incubation was measured using the spectrophotometer, and the rate of CO 2 respiration expressed per gram of soil per well was calculated using the formula provided in the MicroResp™ manual (Macaulay Scientific Consulting, UK). Total substrate-induced respiration responses were calculated by subtracting the water response from each individual substrate response and subsequently summing the single responses for each sample. 2.8 Statistical analysis To study the YCS effect on soil edaphic properties, rhizosphere soil microbial alpha diversity and rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal abundance, univariate statistical analysis was performed in R ( https://www.R-project.org/ ) using a variety × YCS design. The ANOVA function of the car package ( Fox and Weisberg, 2011 ) was used after square-root, log or log-normal transformation of the variables for normalization, if required. For significant effects (P < 0.05), post-hoc pairwise comparisons were performed in R using the multcomp and lsmeans packages ( Hothorn et al., 2008 ; Lenth, 2016 ). Given that the enzyme activity and soil respiration data were not normally distributed (even after log-normal or square-root transformation), Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests ( Hollander and Wolfe, 1973 ) were applied to determine significant one-way effects of variety and YCS. Dunn tests were performed for post-hoc pairwise comparisons ( Dunn, 1964 ) between all variety × YCS combinations (n = 6), accounting for false discovery rates ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ). This allowed the determination of YCS effects on soil extracellular enzyme activities and substrate-induced respiration for each variety. Rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal assemblages were analysed using PRIMER-E Ltd software version 6 (Plymouth, UK). Resemblance matrices for community profiles were constructed by calculating similarities between each pair of samples using the Bray-Curtis coefficient after standardization by sample total and square root transformation ( Clarke and Warwick, 2001 ). To study a potential effect of the rhizosphere soil collection method (soil collected attached to roots vs. soil collected underneath excavated stools) on bacterial and fungal assemblages within each sugarcane field, one-way ANOSIM was applied ( Clarke, 1993 ). Bacterial and fungal assemblages of rhizosphere soils collected directly from roots did not differ from rhizosphere soils collected underneath excavated stools. Significant differences due to rhizosphere soil collection method were only found for bacterial assemblages in one field site (site I2, ANOSIM R = 0.815, P = 0.018) and for fungal assemblages in two of the eight field sites (site I2, R = 1, P = 0.018; site I7, R = 0.833, P = 0.029). Therefore, all rhizosphere soil samples were collectively analysed for variety and YCS effects. Permutation-based multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA; 999 permutations; Anderson, 2001 ) was applied to test the effects of sugarcane variety and YCS using a two-way crossed variety × YCS design. For significant PERMANOVA test results (P < 0.05), principal coordinates analysis (PCO; Gower, 1966 ) was used to visualize the differences in community assemblages. The individual contribution of bacterial and fungal OTUs to differences in the rhizosphere soil community assemblages with YCS was further explored using the SIMPER routine of PRIMER-E Ltd software version 6 (Plymouth, UK). To determine the relative importance of the effects of sugarcane variety and YCS on rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal community assemblages, variation partitioning was carried out to estimate the individual versus combined effects of the explanatory factors on the bacterial and fungal community assemblages, as described by Anderson and Gribble (1998) . The significance of each effect was tested by 999 random permutations using the DISTLM procedure ( McArdle and Anderson, 2001 ) of PRIMER-E Ltd software version 6 (Plymouth, UK). Area-proportional Venn diagrams containing variation partitioning results were constructed using meta-chart ( https://www.meta-chart.com/ ). Rhizosphere soil functional gene abundance data were analysed as reported above for the bacterial and fungal community assemblages, using PERMANOVA to quantify the effects of variety, YCS and their interaction effect on dissimilarities in the functional gene profile. The individual contribution of SEED subsystems level 2 functional gene categories to differences in the rhizosphere soil functional profile with YCS was further explored using STAMP, using the 2-sided Welch's t -test and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction ( Parks and Beiko, 2010 ). 3 Results 3.1 Rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal abundance, richness and community assemblages Gene copies per gram of rhizosphere soil ranged from 1.61 × 10 8 to 5.97 × 10 9 for bacterial 16S rRNA and from 2.03 × 10 4 to 8.20 × 10 6 for fungal 18S rRNA. No significant differences in rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal abundances were found between any of the sampled field sites (data not shown), indicating that YCS incidence did not impact the rhizosphere soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene (P = 0.262) or the fungal 18S rRNA gene (P = 0.261) copy numbers. Rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal richness (OTU richness and Chao1 richness estimate) did not significantly differ with YCS), except for variety MQ239 ( Fig. 1 A; Table S3 ). Rhizosphere soil bacterial communities consisted mainly of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi ( Fig. 2 A), while the fungal communities of sugarcane rhizosphere soils mainly consisted of Ascomycota, in particular Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Euritiomycetes, and Basidiomycota, in particular Agaricomycetes ( Fig. 2 B). Sugarcane variety and YCS significantly affected rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal community assemblages ( Fig. 3 A–B). Moreover, significant variety × YCS interaction effects were measured for both bacterial and fungal community assemblages ( Fig. 3 ). Variation partitioning indicated that sugarcane variety explained the most variation in bacterial and fungal community assemblages (18–19%, Fig. 3 ), followed by spatial distance (12–13%) and YCS (∼2–3%; Fig. 3 ). A SIMPER analysis revealed a lack of consistent trends in rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal relative OTU abundances with YCS across the three studied varieties, as shown for the top 15 contributors to the significant YCS effect measured across varieties in Table S4 (bacteria) and Table S5 (fungi). Except for one Rhodoplanes sp. and unclassified members of the bacterial families Koribacteraceae and Actinosynnemataceae, which all on average increased in relative abundance with YCS in the rhizosphere of all three varieties, no other consistent trend was found among the top contributors to the YCS effect for either bacteria or fungi ( Table S4 , Table S5 ). 3.2 Rhizosphere soil functional gene profile The top 15 most abundant gene categories in the studied sugarcane rhizosphere soils (based on SEED subsystems level 2 classification) together accounted for 49.2% of the relative abundance ( Fig. 4 A). The most abundant functional gene category contained functions involved in plant-prokaryote interactions (on average 8.4% relative abundance, Fig. 4 A). Other highly abundant functional gene categories were involved in C metabolism (central carbohydrate metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, monosaccharides, di-and oligosaccharides), DNA and RNA processing, protein biosynthesis, and resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds ( Fig. 4 A), all functions to be expected in the challenging rhizosphere environment where micro-organisms interact with sugarcane roots. Sugarcane variety (P perm = 0.001) and YCS (P perm = 0.013) both significantly affected the functional gene profile of rhizosphere soils ( Fig. 4 B). However, no significant variety by YCS interaction effect was found (P perm = 0.085; Fig. 4 B). Twenty one functional gene categories (from SEED subsystems level 2 classification) significantly differed in relative abundance with YCS incidence and showed consistent trends in their relative abundance with YCS for each studied sugarcane variety ( Fig. 5 ). The nine functional gene categories that were found depleted in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants are involved in DNA and RNA processing, protein biosynthesis and translocation, and ATP synthesis ( Fig. 5 ), which might reflect a reduced, basal cellular activity of the rhizosphere microbiome with YCS incidence. In contrast, twelve functional gene categories were detected in higher abundance in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants ( Fig. 5 ). These functional gene categories appear involved in five broad functions in the rhizosphere soil: prokaryotic immune response (bacterial cytostatics, differentiation factors and antibiotics, CRISPs, CRISPRs and associated hypotheticals), metabolism of root exudates (anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds, biotin, catabolism of aromatic compounds, fatty acid metabolic cluster, fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, biotin), methanogenesis (co-enzyme F420), cell division (cytochrome biogenesis) and rhizosphere and/or root colonization (biosynthesis of galactoglycans and associated lipopolysaccharides). The specific functions related to the functional gene categories that were significantly and consistently enriched or depleted in the rhizosphere of YCS-affected plants were not tested in this study. Instead, we measured the activity of several extracellular enzymes involved in metabolism of simple and more complex carbon substrates in rhizosphere soil (section 3.4 ). For all genes encoding the studied enzymes, their relative abundance in the rhizosphere soils of YCS-affected fields did not significantly differ from their relative abundance in rhizosphere soil from the corresponding asymptomatic control fields ( Table S6 ). This is in agreement with the lack of significant and consistent trends in the corresponding enzyme activities with YCS incidence (section 3.4 ). 3.3 Soil edaphic properties YCS incidence was not related to significant shifts in soil pH, total or dissolved soil carbon and nitrogen ( Table 1 ). YCS symptomatic fields had a lower soil C:N ratio (on average 12.15) than the corresponding control fields (on average 13.86), but this YCS effect was only significant for soils across the three varieties and not for each variety separately ( Table 1 ). Asymptomatic and YCS affected fields also differed in total soil carbon and dissolved nitrogen across varieties, but opposite trends in these soil properties were measured for fields of variety MQ239 compared to varieties KQ228 A and Q240 A ( Table 1 ). 3.4 Soil microbial functions as measured by extracellular enzyme activity, basal and substrate-induced respiration When soils from all three sugarcane varieties were analysed together, the activity of each tested soil extracellular enzyme was significantly lower in YCS symptomatic fields compared to asymptomatic control fields, as demonstrated by the significant YCS effects ( Figure 6 A, Table S7 ). Indeed, for each individual variety, extracellular enzyme activities decreased with YCS incidence, but this reduction in activity was only significant for all three varieties for chitinase, and not the other five enzymes ( Table S7 ). Correspondingly, the sum of the activities of all six studied enzymes combined was lower in YCS symptomatic compared to control fields for all three varieties, but this YCS effect was only significant for varieties KQ228 A and MQ239 and not for Q240 A ( Figure 6 A, Table S7 ). Basal soil respiration was not significantly different between YCS symptomatic and asymptomatic fields ( Table S8 ). Overall, substrate-induced respiration was slightly lower in YCS fields of each variety compared to the corresponding asymptomatic fields, but this trend was not always significant ( Table S8 ). For oxalic acid and l -arginine, significant YCS effects were found for one or two of the three varieties, respectively ( Table S8 ). When responses to all seven studied substrates were combined, a significant YCS effect on soil respiration was only detected for variety MQ239 ( Figure 6 B, Table S8 ). 4 Discussion 4.1 Microbial community response to YCS We observed that YCS incidence significantly influenced rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal community assemblages, but not bacterial and fungal richness. Relatively few studies to date have examined the influence of plant disease on the diversity of the plant-associated microbial community ( Gardener and Weller, 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ; Araujo et al., 2002 ; Reiter et al., 2002 ; Filion et al., 2004 ; Trivedi et al., 2010 , 2011 ). Similar to the results of our study, Filion et al. (2004) have reported negative effects of root rot disease on the stability of the rhizosphere bacterial community of black spruce (Picea mariana) seedlings. Shifts in the fungal community composition in response to pathogen infection have also been observed ( Filion et al., 2004 ; Vujanovic et al., 2007 ). In contrast to our findings with YCS, some studies have reported an increase in bacterial diversity associated with infested plants ( Yang et al., 2001 ; Reiter et al., 2002 ). We postulate that the nature of the observed fluctuations in the structure and function of the plant-associated microbial community would be differentially determined by the virulence mechanism(s) of the pathogen and the response of host plant to disease infection along with soil edaphic factors. Several culture-independent studies examining bacterial diversity in various ecological niches have provided evidence that shifts in microbial community composition underlie states of host health and disease ( Araújo et al., 2002 ; Sagaram et al., 2009 ; Tyler et al., 2009 ; Trivedi et al., 2010 ). Our study did not detect an overwhelming dominance by a single microbial species in YCS symptomatic samples. We detected shifts in rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal community assemblages with YCS, but significant variety × YCS interaction effects were observed. The main contributors to the measured YCS effects on the bacterial and fungal communities showed inconsistent trends between the three studied varieties, with some exceptions for bacteria. This finding is supported by a recent study that reported a shift in core endophytic microbiomes of leaf, stalk and root of YCS-affected sugarcane plants ( Hamonts et al., 2018 ). Indeed, we did observe an increase in the relative abundance of certain bacterial OTUs (unclassified bacteria belonging to the Rhodoplanes genus and the Koribacteracea and Actinosynnemataceae families) in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic compared to asymptomatic plants of all varieties. Although not tested in this study, it may be speculated that YCS is a consequence of imbalances in the resident microflora based on the “Ecological Hypothesis”. According to this theory, it is likely that many pathogens did not initially evolve as pathogens, but simply take on this role as a result of a lack of ability of the host to maintain homeostasis. The YCS-associated OTUs might exemplify such imbalances in the rhizosphere bacterial community of sugarcane. On the other hand, these YCS-associated OTUs (see Table S4 &S5) may represent promising candidates for investigating and tracking YCS progression and could provide candidate biomarkers for early YCS detection. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we are not able to conclude from our results whether an increased relative abundance of different bacteria is the cause or rather the result of YCS. Alternatively, colonization by opportunistic pathogens or uncontrolled growth of commensals may have taken advantage of a compromised host immune system caused by a primary agent and/or unfavourable environmental conditions. To date, the biotic and/or abiotic causal agent(s) of YCS remain to be determined and further detailed studies based on comparing the functional microbiome of YCS symptomatic plants under various stages of YCS development are required. 4.2 Functional gene profile response to YCS In contrast to microbial (phylogenetic) community response, we observed significant and consistent changes in the relative abundance of particular soil microbial functional gene categories in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants compared to asymptomatic control plants. This is in agreement with a previous study that reported significant changes in the functional potential of the rhizosphere microbiome of citrus infected with huanglogbing ( Trivedi et al., 2012 ). Below we discuss the various functional gene categories that showed consistent differences in relative abundance in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic versus asymptomatic control plants for the three studied varieties. A change in these functional gene abundances might imply a change in the associated rhizosphere functions with YCS. Several studies have reported that the composition of the rhizosphere microbial community is related to the diversity of nutrients and plant secondary metabolites present in root exudates ( Dakora and Phillips, 2002 ; Matilla et al. 2010 ; Jones et al., 2009 ; Trivedi et al., 2012 ). We observed that various functional genes involved in root exudate metabolism were enriched in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants compared to asymptomatic sugarcane. Although root exudates were not analysed in our study, introduction of phytopathogens and non-native bacteria along with abiotic stresses have been shown to change the amount and composition of organic acids, sugars and other essential nutrients in root exudates ( Phillips et al., 2004 ; Kamilova et al., 2006 ; Neumann and Römheld, 2007 ). YCS is known to cause carbohydrate partitioning imbalances throughout the plant wherein much higher levels of starch are observed in the leaves, whereas the roots are depleted of any starch ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). We hypothesize that alterations in plant physiology leading to quantitative and qualitative changes in partitioning of the photoassimilates is primarily responsible for the selection of traits involved in metabolism of these altered root exudate compounds in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants. CRISPR–Cas systems confer adaptive immunity against exogenic elements in bacteria and archaea and are a major line of prokaryotic defense based on the self-non-self discrimination principle, which recognizes and targets foreign DNA ( Makarova et al., 2013 ). Our comparison of microbial metagenomes revealed that such bacterial defense systems were consistently more abundant in YCS symptomatic compared to asymptomatic sugarcane rhizosphere metagenomes. CRISPR-Cas systems have been reported to be enriched in the rhizosphere of barley ( Bulgarelli et al., 2015 ) and beech ( Colin et al., 2017 ), suggesting that this may be a common trait of rhizosphere bacterial communities. Genes involved in the biosynthesis of structural exopolysaccharides such as galactoglycans and lipopolysaccharides were enriched in YCS symptomatic sugarcane rhizosphere metagenomes. These compounds represent a class of virulence factors shielding bacteria from adverse host environments and to circumvent the host's surveillance and defence systems ( Ranf et al., 2016 ). These compounds can additionally be modified for adaptation to changing environments encountered during host colonization ( Ranf, 2016 ). Interestingly, genes involved in the transport of various capsular polysaccharides were reported to be significantly higher in pathogens as compared to plant symbionts, rhizosphere or bulk soil bacteria ( Hardoim et al., 2015 ). Although, this study did not characterise changes in the root exudation patterns in response to YCS incidence, it can be argued that YCS may promote specific microbial groups with a better ability to synthesize and metabolize complex polysaccharides. These recruitments can potentially result in altered immune responses in the plant host leading to an overall decline in health, performance, and stress tolerance. We detected significant enrichments of various genes involved in anaerobic processes such as degradation of aromatic compounds and methanogenesis in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants. Water transport is impaired in YCS symptomatic plants ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ) which could result in a relatively higher soil water content in the rhizosphere of symptomatic plants. This, in combination with a potentially higher carbohydrate content (as a result of the higher sugar content of YCS symptomatic plants some of which is likely to be exuded into the rhizosphere soil), might result in a relatively higher rate of oxygen consumption in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants, resulting in more anaerobic conditions. However, we have no evidence to support this hypothesis. We also observed that genes associated with DNA/RNA/protein metabolism and ATP synthesis were depleted in the rhizosphere of YCS symptomatic plants, suggesting a reduced basal activity of the rhizosphere microbiota. Trivedi et al. (2012) have reported an increased abundance of slow growing microbes in the rhizosphere of citrus infected with huanglongbing that is related to changes in the relative abundance of various genes involved in nutrient acquisition. Our study indicates a possible link between YCS, root exudation and enrichment of rhizosphere microbiota with specific traits involved in anaerobic metabolism, root exudate metabolism and prokaryotic immune response that impacts the normal functioning of the rhizosphere microbiome, most likely in response to changes in plant physiology of the sugarcane host. Alternatively, the observed changes in the rhizosphere metagenome might result in a stress response in the host. 4.3 Edaphic factors and soil functions response to YCS We did not detect significant, consistent changes in the tested physico-chemical soil properties with YCS incidence. Our results therefore suggest that nutrient content was not directly linked to YCS development. This is in agreement with previous observations that YCS development was not related to deficiencies of N, Fe or other mineral nutrients ( Marquardt et al., 2016 ). Extracellular enzyme activity and substrate-induced respiration assays, which are considered as reliable and sensitive proxies for soil functions, in particular decomposition rates ( Trivedi et al., 2016 , 2017 ), demonstrated lower but statistically non-significant soil enzyme activities and respiration rates in YCS symptomatic compared to corresponding asymptomatic fields, except for chitinase activity. Combined with above and lack of response in rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal abundance, our study indicates that the lower activities measured in soils from YCS symptomatic fields were not due to lower numbers of bacteria and fungi. Moreover, no differences in relative abundance of the functional genes encoding the studied enzymes were observed in the studied rhizosphere soil samples. However, specific functions other than the tested enzyme activities and substrate-induced soil respiration might alter with YCS. In conclusion, the results of our study show that YCS could play an important role in re-structuring the composition and function of the rhizosphere microbiome. These fluctuations might result from the fact that YCS compromises the plant defence and alters root exudation patterns. Moreover, we detected significant depletion of microbial functions involved in DNA/RNA/protein processing but no depletion in specific functions involved in nutrient acquisition, as hypothesised. However, we identified consistent enrichment in the relative abundance of functional genes encoding for defence against pathogens and for metabolism of root exudates in the rhizosphere of YCS affected plants, which might reflect a defence response against a pathogen or the response of a stressed plant. Additionally, our study contributes in fulfilling a key knowledge gap on the consistent response of microbial functional metagenomes from different crop varieties under stress. By identifying key phylogenetic taxa and specific functional genes that consistently responded to YCS incidence, this study provides initial data for future investigation into development of YCS diagnostic tools and effective YCS management strategies.
