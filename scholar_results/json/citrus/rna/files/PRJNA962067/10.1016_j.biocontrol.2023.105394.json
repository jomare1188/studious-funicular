    "full_text": "Pear black spot caused by Alternaria alternata is widespread in Chinese orchards, causing serious losses. Screening of effective biocontrol microorganisms is important for controlling this disease. Bacillus tequilensis 2_2a has biocontrol potential . This study aimed to verify the antifungal activity of B. tequilensis against A. alternata and biocontrol effect on pear black spot, to elucidate by transcriptomic and metabolomic approach, the molecular pathway underlying to effect of strain against A. alternata , to validate the effect on genes and metabolic components related to the molecular action mechanisms, and to analyse the mechanisms and molecular targets of the biocontroller bacteria. The results showed that B. tequilensis inhibited mycelial growth. B. tequilensis caused A. alternata mycelial aggregation, twisting, and entanglement. B. tequilensis controlled pear black spot by over 90%. Six pathways were related to the key differentially expressed genes and metabolites of B. tequilensis -treated A. alternata : glycolysis, citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, pentose phosphate pathway, pyrimidine metabolism and cell cycle. Validated changes in the expression of key genes were consistent with the transcriptomic data, and the interactions among these pathways mainly affected glucose conversion, citric acid synthesis, intracellular redox-related biosynthesis of pyridine nucleotides, and adenine nucleotides that provide energy. This research helps to promote the biocontrol agent B. tequilensis , as it provides the mechanism behind its biocontrol efficacy."

          "Alternaria is an economically impactful fungal genus, and nearly 90 % of the species within this genus are facultative parasites on different plants that cause various diseases, resulting in field and postharvest losses ( Noelting et al., 2022 ). Alternaria fungi can produce over 70 kinds of toxic metabolites ( Jarolim et al., 2017 ). Alternaria alternata (Fries) Keissler is an important plant pathogen that causes black spot in many fruits, vegetables, and other plants ( Siciliano et al., 2017 ), such as apple ( Chen et al., 2012 ), tobacco ( Wang et al., 2015 ), strawberry ( Zhang et al., 2015 ), and pear ( Jiang et al., 2022 ), worldwide. Since the discovery of A. alternata -induced pear black spot in 1935 in China, this disease has become widespread, resulting in significant losses in pear production ( Jia et al., 2021 ). Chemical pesticides play an important role in disease prevention and control, but their inappropriate use has led to many problems, such as environmental pollution and pesticide resistance ( Babu et al., 2003 ). There is an urgent need to develop and apply beneficial biocontrol agents. Research on biocontrol agents for diseases caused by A. alternata and their application is ongoing, include mainly Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Serratia spp. ( Gao et al., 2022; Youssef et al., 2018; Ahmad et al., 2023 ).",
          "Bacillus species used for plant disease prevention and control ( Yánez-Mendizábal et al., 2018 ). Exploration of the ability of new Bacillus species to effectively prevent and control diseases will enhance our knowledge of the application prospects of Bacillus biocontrol agents in agriculture. In 2006, Gatson et al. (2006) first isolated B. tequilensis in Jalisco, Mexico. While Xie et al. (2015) showed that B. tequilensis 7PJ-16 had a strong antagonistic effect on ten pathogenic fungi of mulberry such as Scleromitrula shiraiana , Sclerotinia sclerotiorum , and Cochliobolus . Li et al. (2018) isolated B. tequilensis GYLH001, which has potential application for the biological control of Magnaporthe oryzae . Zhou et al. (2019) isolated B. tequilensis JN-369 and found that it significantly inhibited the mycelial growth of Magnaporthe grisea by approximately 70 %. Daungfu et al. (2019) found that B. tequilensis PO80 reduced the incidence of citrus canker. B. tequilensis has broad application prospects as a broad-spectrum biocontrol bacterium in agricultural production.",
          "The mechanisms of the biological bacterium B. tequilensis have not yet been completely elucidated, although some research has been conducted. Generally, antibacterial effects are achieved through three mechanisms: inhibition of the growth of pathogens, induction of changes in the plant's genes, and inhibition via colonization of the plant through bacterial movement ( Li et al., 2020 ). Reports on biological control have not clarified the main pathways by which biological bacteria inhibit pathogens. In this context, we obtained a broad-spectrum antifungal strain with an unknown mechanism: B. tequilensis 2_2a (Authorized Chinese Inventions Patent) which mechanisms are necessary elucidate. The primary objectives of the present study were (a) to verify the antifungal activity of the strain against A. alternata and its biocontrol effect on pear black spot, (b) to elucidate by transcriptomic and metabolomic approach, the molecular pathway underlying to effect of the strain against A. alternata , (c) to validate its effect on genes and metabolic components related to the molecular action mechanisms, and (d) to analyse the mechanisms and molecular targets of biocontroller bacteria and provide a theoretical basis for the exploration of multifunctional targeted biocontrol bacteria."

Then, 20 μL of B. tequilensis suspension (1 × 10 5 cfu/mL) was added to each well. An A. alternata mycelium disc was inoculated into the centre of the PDA plate and used as the blank control. The experiment was conducted twice with three independent repetitions. The plates were cultured at a constant temperature of 25 °C for 5 days, and A. alternata colony diameter was measured using the crossover method ( Kumar et al., 2012 ). Simultaneously, morphological changes at the A. alternata mycelial edge were observed at a magnification of 200 × with an ultra-depth-of-field microscope connected to a computer (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan). The mycelium inhibition percentage was calculated as follows: mycelium inhibition percentage (%) = [(blank control colony diameter - treatment colony diameter)/blank control colony diameter] × 100."

                  "In 2019, 2020 and 2021, field experiments were carried out in a pear orchard cv. “Huangguan” in the village Wutunzi in the city of Botou city, Hebei Province. The 9- to11- year-old trees presented a row spacing of 3 m × 4 m, a height of 2.0–2.5 m and moderate vigour. An outbreak of black spot disease caused by A. alternata on pear was registered every year. The first application of B. tequilensis was performed before the occurrence of disease in early June of each year (during the young-fruit stage of the pear trees). B. tequilensis was applied every 10 to 14 days for a total of three times. The specific application dates were June 3, 14, and 27, 2019; June 2, 15, and 26, 2020; and June 4, 14, and 26, 2021. The recommended dose for field use was 1 × 10 7 cfu/mL, and water was used as the blank control. Each treatment in the experiment was applied to four plots, with the treatments randomly assigned to the plots. Each plot contained four pear trees, and each plot was a replicate of one treatment. The distance between different sites of treatment was 5 m. A Mount Taishan-18 high-pressure motorized sprayer (Shanghai Jequeson Industrial Co., Ltd.) was used to spray each treatment. The sprayer was a double-cone nozzle electric backpack-style sprayer, and the spray pressure was 0.15 ∼ 0.40 MPa. Each tree was sprayed with 1.5 L of solution until the leaves and fruit were evenly wet and the solution had dropped slightly. The disease indexes were investigated as the fruit approached maturity. Two trees were selected in each plot, and 1000 fruit were randomly picked from five branches by tree, namely, east, south, west, north, and middle branches. In addition, 100 leaves were selected from each branch to investigate the disease index. The degree of disease in the leaves was graded using the percentage of lesion area. The disease grading scale consisted of the following 6 levels as described by Yang et al., (2020) as: 0: no lesions, 1: 0 < P ≤ 5 %, 2: 5 %<P ≤ 25 %, 3: 25 %<P ≤ 50 %, 4: 50 %<P ≤ 75 %, and 5: 75 %<P ≤ 100 %. The control effect of B. tequilensis was calculated using multiple equations as follows: The disease index was calculated as follows: disease index=∑ (number of diseased leaves at each level × corresponding disease level)/(total number of surveyed leaves × highest disease level) × 100. The incidence percentage was calculated as follows: incidence percentage = number of treated diseased fruit/number of blank control diseased fruit. The control effect was calculated as follows: control effect (%)=(blank control disease index or incidence percentage - treatment disease index or incidence percentage)/blank control disease index or incidence percentage × 100."

This will guide the scientific use of this biocontrol bacterium based on the mechanism behind its biocontrol efficacy.",

B. tequilensis inhibited mycelial growth, causing mycelial aggregation, twisting, and entanglement. B. tequilensis controlled pear black spot in the field by more than 90 %. Pradhan et al. (2013) preliminarily found that B. tequilensis exerts its inhibitory effects by destroying pathogenic mycelial biomembranes. These results are consistent with the effects of B. tequilensis observed in this study. In addition, Ma et al. (2012) found that B. tequilensis antagonizes A. alternata , Magnaporthe oryzae , Ralstonia solanacearum , and Fusarium oxysporum . B. tequilensis is a biologically antagonistic bacterium with high biocontrol potential.",
          "B. tequilensis affected gene expression and metabolite levels in A. alternata through six main correlated pathways: glycolysis, the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway, pyrimidine metabolism and the cell cycle. The glycolysis pathway is at the core of this overall network. Glucose 6-phosphate, the first intermediate metabolite formed in glycolysis, is an important node molecule that connects the pentose phosphate pathway and glucose metabolism ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). Li et al. (2023) and Zhao et al. (2023) reported that the downregulation of glycolysis pathway gene expression can cause changes in glucose conversion.",
          "The TCA cycle links amino acid or fat metabolism and glycolysis and participates in several signalling pathways, including the protein kinase A and AMPK pathways ( Tao et al., 2017 ). The TCA cycle is a key pathway involved in the response to fungicide toxicity ( Wang and Shen, 2016 ). Nordström (1963) reported that inhibition of the TCA cycle weakens the mitochondrial oxidation capacity and reduces the levels of acetyl-CoA, TCA, succinic acid and ATP. In this study, B. tequilensis significantly decreased the expression of genes in the A. alternata TCA cycle and the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinic acid.",
          "Additionally, B. tequilensis affected the oxidative phosphorylation pathway by inhibiting the transformation of NADH to NAD, the transformation of succinic acid to fumaric acid and the synthesis of ATP. SDHI fungicides were reported to act on succinate dehydrogenase, inhibit the transfer of electrons from succinate to ubiquinone, interfere with the electron transfer function of complex II on the respiratory chain, and prevent complex II from generating energy ( Bouillaud, 2023 ). B. tequilensis simultaneously acted on multiple sites in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in A. alternata , indicating a much more complex mechanism of action than that of SDHI fungicides.",
          "In addition, B. tequilensis blocked NADPH production in A. alternata and disrupted the pentose phosphate pathway. The fungicide cymoxanil fungicide also solely blocks oxidation and phosphorylation by inhibiting electron transfer in the mitochondria of pathogens ( Toffolatti et al., 2015 ). Effects on NADH, NADPH and ATP will lead to effects on the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway will also be affected ( Behrends et al., 2019 ). The above four basic metabolic pathways indirectly affect the overall pyrimidine metabolism pathway and the cell cycle of the pathogen. These findings indicate that B. tequilensis pathogenic activity through multiple targets.",
          "B. tequilensis has shown strong potential research and application value. It is necessary to continue analysing the relationships between the functional substances of B. tequilensis and the genes targeted by this pathogen. The inhibitory effects of Bacillus biocontrol agents depend on the complex and finely-tuned regulatory network between Bacillus and pathogens. It is necessary to gradually build a complete system to regulate the inhibitory effects of functional substances on their molecular targets at the molecular level to create targeted biocontrol inhibitors and achieve biological control of plant pathogens."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Alternaria is an economically impactful fungal genus, and nearly 90 % of the species within this genus are facultative parasites on different plants that cause various diseases, resulting in field and postharvest losses ( Noelting et al., 2022 ). Alternaria fungi can produce over 70 kinds of toxic metabolites ( Jarolim et al., 2017 ). Alternaria alternata (Fries) Keissler is an important plant pathogen that causes black spot in many fruits, vegetables, and other plants ( Siciliano et al., 2017 ), such as apple ( Chen et al., 2012 ), tobacco ( Wang et al., 2015 ), strawberry ( Zhang et al., 2015 ), and pear ( Jiang et al., 2022 ), worldwide. Since the discovery of A. alternata -induced pear black spot in 1935 in China, this disease has become widespread, resulting in significant losses in pear production ( Jia et al., 2021 ). Chemical pesticides play an important role in disease prevention and control, but their inappropriate use has led to many problems, such as environmental pollution and pesticide resistance ( Babu et al., 2003 ). There is an urgent need to develop and apply beneficial biocontrol agents. Research on biocontrol agents for diseases caused by A. alternata and their application is ongoing, include mainly Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Serratia spp. ( Gao et al., 2022; Youssef et al., 2018; Ahmad et al., 2023 ). Bacillus species used for plant disease prevention and control ( Yánez-Mendizábal et al., 2018 ). Exploration of the ability of new Bacillus species to effectively prevent and control diseases will enhance our knowledge of the application prospects of Bacillus biocontrol agents in agriculture. In 2006, Gatson et al. (2006) first isolated B. tequilensis in Jalisco, Mexico. While Xie et al. (2015) showed that B. tequilensis 7PJ-16 had a strong antagonistic effect on ten pathogenic fungi of mulberry such as Scleromitrula shiraiana , Sclerotinia sclerotiorum , and Cochliobolus . Li et al. (2018) isolated B. tequilensis GYLH001, which has potential application for the biological control of Magnaporthe oryzae . Zhou et al. (2019) isolated B. tequilensis JN-369 and found that it significantly inhibited the mycelial growth of Magnaporthe grisea by approximately 70 %. Daungfu et al. (2019) found that B. tequilensis PO80 reduced the incidence of citrus canker. B. tequilensis has broad application prospects as a broad-spectrum biocontrol bacterium in agricultural production. The mechanisms of the biological bacterium B. tequilensis have not yet been completely elucidated, although some research has been conducted. Generally, antibacterial effects are achieved through three mechanisms: inhibition of the growth of pathogens, induction of changes in the plant's genes, and inhibition via colonization of the plant through bacterial movement ( Li et al., 2020 ). Reports on biological control have not clarified the main pathways by which biological bacteria inhibit pathogens. In this context, we obtained a broad-spectrum antifungal strain with an unknown mechanism: B. tequilensis 2_2a (Authorized Chinese Inventions Patent) which mechanisms are necessary elucidate. The primary objectives of the present study were (a) to verify the antifungal activity of the strain against A. alternata and its biocontrol effect on pear black spot, (b) to elucidate by transcriptomic and metabolomic approach, the molecular pathway underlying to effect of the strain against A. alternata , (c) to validate its effect on genes and metabolic components related to the molecular action mechanisms, and (d) to analyse the mechanisms and molecular targets of biocontroller bacteria and provide a theoretical basis for the exploration of multifunctional targeted biocontrol bacteria. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Microbial isolates Antagonistic strains: B. tequilensis 2_2a has been deposited in the China General Microorganisms Collection and Management Center ( https://www.cgmcc.net ) under accession number CGMCC No. 19446. The application of this strain has been granted the List of Chinese Inventions Patent ( https://www.cnipa.gov.cn , Announcement No. CN114231444B). B. tequilensis 2_2a was streak cultured on Luria-Bertain (LB) plates and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days, and then a small amount of mycelium was removed and shaken in LB culture liquid at 180rmp and 30 °C for 36 h, B. tequilensis fermentation broth was diluted to 1 × 10 9 cfu/mL by microscope. Pathogenic strains: A. alternata JS-1 was kindly provided by Professors Fengquan Liu and Yancun Zhao of Jiangsu Academy of Agriculture Science and maintained in the laboratory. The JS-1 strain was inoculated into potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates cultured at a constant-temperature of 25 °C for 5 days and then stored at 4 °C for subsequent experiments. 2.2 Antifungal activity and control effect of B. tequilensis 2.2.1 Determination of the antifungal activity of B. tequilensis To determine mycelial antifungal activity, the cylinder-plate method was used ( Grzelak et al., 2013 ). Briefly, one A. alternata mycelial disc of 5 mm diameter was inoculated into the centre of the PDA plate, and four holes with an inner diameter of 6 mm were drilled in a cross-shaped pattern 3 cm from the centre. Then, 20 μL of B. tequilensis suspension (1 × 10 5 cfu/mL) was added to each well. An A. alternata mycelium disc was inoculated into the centre of the PDA plate and used as the blank control. The experiment was conducted twice with three independent repetitions. The plates were cultured at a constant temperature of 25 °C for 5 days, and A. alternata colony diameter was measured using the crossover method ( Kumar et al., 2012 ). Simultaneously, morphological changes at the A. alternata mycelial edge were observed at a magnification of 200 × with an ultra-depth-of-field microscope connected to a computer (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan). The mycelium inhibition percentage was calculated as follows: mycelium inhibition percentage (%) = [(blank control colony diameter - treatment colony diameter)/blank control colony diameter] × 100. 2.2.2 Effects of field control on A. alternata -induced pear black spot In 2019, 2020 and 2021, field experiments were carried out in a pear orchard cv. “Huangguan” in the village Wutunzi in the city of Botou city, Hebei Province. The 9- to11- year-old trees presented a row spacing of 3 m × 4 m, a height of 2.0–2.5 m and moderate vigour. An outbreak of black spot disease caused by A. alternata on pear was registered every year. The first application of B. tequilensis was performed before the occurrence of disease in early June of each year (during the young-fruit stage of the pear trees). B. tequilensis was applied every 10 to 14 days for a total of three times. The specific application dates were June 3, 14, and 27, 2019; June 2, 15, and 26, 2020; and June 4, 14, and 26, 2021. The recommended dose for field use was 1 × 10 7 cfu/mL, and water was used as the blank control. Each treatment in the experiment was applied to four plots, with the treatments randomly assigned to the plots. Each plot contained four pear trees, and each plot was a replicate of one treatment. The distance between different sites of treatment was 5 m. A Mount Taishan-18 high-pressure motorized sprayer (Shanghai Jequeson Industrial Co., Ltd.) was used to spray each treatment. The sprayer was a double-cone nozzle electric backpack-style sprayer, and the spray pressure was 0.15 ∼ 0.40 MPa. Each tree was sprayed with 1.5 L of solution until the leaves and fruit were evenly wet and the solution had dropped slightly. The disease indexes were investigated as the fruit approached maturity. Two trees were selected in each plot, and 1000 fruit were randomly picked from five branches by tree, namely, east, south, west, north, and middle branches. In addition, 100 leaves were selected from each branch to investigate the disease index. The degree of disease in the leaves was graded using the percentage of lesion area. The disease grading scale consisted of the following 6 levels as described by Yang et al., (2020) as: 0: no lesions, 1: 0 < P ≤ 5 %, 2: 5 %<P ≤ 25 %, 3: 25 %<P ≤ 50 %, 4: 50 %<P ≤ 75 %, and 5: 75 %<P ≤ 100 %. The control effect of B. tequilensis was calculated using multiple equations as follows: The disease index was calculated as follows: disease index=∑ (number of diseased leaves at each level × corresponding disease level)/(total number of surveyed leaves × highest disease level) × 100. The incidence percentage was calculated as follows: incidence percentage = number of treated diseased fruit/number of blank control diseased fruit. The control effect was calculated as follows: control effect (%)=(blank control disease index or incidence percentage - treatment disease index or incidence percentage)/blank control disease index or incidence percentage × 100. 2.3 Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of the effect of B. tequilensis against A. alternata 2.3.1 Transcriptomic analysis of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis Preparation of A. alternata mycelia following different treatments for transcriptome and metabolomic analysis. For co-culture of A. alternata mycelia with B. tequilensis , three A. alternata mycelium discs were added to 54 mL of PD medium at 25 °C and shaken at 180 r/min. After 36 h, 6 mL of B. tequilensis fermentation broth (1 × 10 6 cfu/mL) was added; no fermentation broth was added to the control group. After 3 days of co-cultivation, the liquid was filtered with filter paper, and the mycelia were rinsed multiple times with sterile water and vacuum-filtered for 15 min. Each treatment was repeated three times. Mycelia obtained by the same method were used for transcriptomic and metabolomic experiments. RNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing of A. alternata RNA treated with B. tequilensis were then performed. Mycelia were collected from A. alternata subjected to different treatments and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using a NovaSeq 6000 SP500 Cycle Reagent Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA), and the concentration and purity of the extracted RNA were measured using a NanoDrop 2000 (NanoDrop Technology LLC, Massachusetts, USA). Single database construction requires a total RNA amount ≥ 1 μg, concentration ≥ 35 ng· μL −1 , OD 260/280 ≥ 1.8, and OD 260/230 ≥ 1.0. The A. alternata reference genome version GCF_001642055.1 was used ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/11201 ). The RNA-seq library was constructed using the Illumina TruSeq TM RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). For transcriptomic analysis of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis , transcriptomic functional annotation, expression quantification and difference analysis of the samples were conducted. All transcripts were compared with multiple databases (the NR, GO and KEGG databases) and annotated. RSEM quantitative software ( https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/ . README.html) was used to statistically analyse correlations between sample groups on the basis of transcripts per million (TPM) using the logarithmic Kendall covariance coefficient test, complete clustering, and the Euclidean distance algorithm. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by calculating the distance between samples using the vst function in DESeq2 and one-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was carried out for significant test for the clustering of samples. The differential expression of genes between samples was analysed using DESeq2 software ( Love et al., 2014 ), with a screening threshold of |log2FC |≥1.15 and p.adjust < 0.01 and with Bonferroni multiple test correction. The differentially expressed genes were screened on the basis of a fold change of 5.0. GOATOOLS software ( https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/goatools ) was used to perform functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes; Fisher's method was used for testing. An adjusted P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate significant enrichment of a GO function. By comparison with the KEGG database, specific biological pathways in which the genes may participate were also obtained. R script was used to perform KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes in gene sets with the same parameters used for GO functional enrichment analysis. An adjusted P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate significant enrichment of a KEGG pathway. 2.3.2 Metabolomic analysis of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis To extract and detect metabolic components from A. alternata treated, fifty milligrams of A. alternata mycelia were shaken and co-cultured with or without B. tequilensis fermentation broth (1 × 10 5 cfu/mL) in a 2 mL centrifuge tube, and a grinding bead with a diameter of 6 mm was added. Then, 400 μL of an extract (methanol:water = 4:1 (v: v)), containing 0.02 mg/mL internal standard (L-2-chlorophenylalanine) was added. The sample was ground for 6 min (-10 °C, 50 Hz), subjected to low-temperature ultrasound extraction for 30 min (5 °C, 40 kHz), chilled at −20 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged for 15 min (13000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was transferred to an injection vial with an internal tube. Additionally, 20 μL subsamples were taken from each sample, and the supernatant was mixed as a quality control (QC) sample. LC-MS detection was performed using a UHPLC-Q Active ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem Fourier transform mass spectrometry system (Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd., Everett, USA). The chromatographic column was an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.8 μM; Waters, Milford, USA). Mobile phase A consisted of 95 % water + 5 % acetonitrile (containing 0.1 % formic acid), and mobile phase B consisted of 47.5 % acetonitrile + 47.5 % isopropanol + 5 % water (containing 0.1 % formic acid). The flow rate was 0.40 mL/min, and the injection volume was 2 μL. The column temperature was 40 °C. Each sample was ionized by electrospray, and the mass spectrum signal was collected. For metabolomic analysis of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis , the expression data were preliminarily using the following conditions: feature value removal: missing values within each group > 20 %, missing value filling method: minimum value, data normalization method: sum, QC verification: RSD ≤ 30 %, and log value method: log10. After preprocessing, all metabolites identified by mass spectrometry were compared with the KEGG database to obtain annotation information on the metabolites from the database, and their annotation status in the database was statistically analysed. Volcano plots were created to visualize the distributions of differences in metabolite levels between the two groups of samples at a significance level of 0.05. KEGG functional pathway analysis ( p < 0.05) was carried out using the KEGG_V94.2 database. 2.3.3 Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis By utilizing iPath3.0 ( https://pathways.embl . de), we visualized and analysed transcriptomic and metabolic pathways, and performed correlation analysis based on the annotation results from the differentially abundant metabolites and the differentially expressed genes in the metabolic pathways. Based on the correlation analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis , a core regulatory network model was constructed and analysed. 2.4 Verification of the main genes and metabolic components involved in the effect of B. tequilensis against A. alternata 2.4.1 Detection of substantially differentially expressed genes in A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis Differentially expressed genes were selected for RT-PCR analysis to determine whether gene expression based on the RNA-seq and RT-PCR data was consistent. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, and the RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase. The primers for qRT-PCR were designed using Primer Premier 6 ( https://www . premierbiosoft.com/primerdesign/index.html ). The partial primers are listed in Table 1 . Fluorescence quantification was performed with a FastSYBR Mixture qPCR Kit in a reaction containing 10 μL of 2 × FastSYBR Mixture, 0.5 µL of 10 μM forward primer, 0.5 µL of 10 µM reverse primer, 1 μL of cDNA, and 8 µL of ddH 2 O. A real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster, USA) was used for thermal cycling and to record fluorescence changes, and three repeated verifications were performed. The 2 -ΔΔ Ct method was used to determine the relative expression levels ( Wu et al., 2020 ). 2.4.2 Verification of the influence of B. tequilensis on the main metabolic components of A. alternata The main metabolic pathways that involve glucose include glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and pentose phosphate pathway; therefore, the glucose content in treated A. alternata was measured . Glucose was extracted from treated mycelia, the absorbance values were measured and the glucose content was calculated with a Solarbio Glucose Content Assay Kit on a spectrophotometer/Microplate Reader (Solarbio Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The citric acid content and citrate synthesis play an important role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Citric acid and citrate synthase were extracted from treated mycelia. The absorbance values were measured, and the citric acid content and citrate synthase activity were calculated with a Solarbio Citric Acid Content Assay Kit/Citrate Synthase Activity Assay Kit with a spectrophotometer/microplate reader (Solarbio Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. By detecting mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption rate, OCR) detection, real-time insights can be gained into the main metabolic pathways involved in respiration function. To detect the OCR detection, after inoculation and cultivation on a PDA plate for 14 days, A. alternata spores were produced. The spores were washed with PBS, and 100 µL of culture medium was added to a single well of a specialized cell culture plate (product number 100777004, USA). A spore suspension was obtained by mixing, and the concentration was adjusted to 5–6 × 10 5 cfu/mL. Four microlitres of the fluorescent oxygen probe BboxiProbe® R01 was added, and the samples were mixed. Fermentation broth (10 µL) containing 1 × 10 6 cfu/mL B. tequilensis and filtered impurities was added, while no B. tequilensis was added to the blank control. Then, 100 μL of oxygen blocking solution was added, and a Seahorse energy metabolic analyser (Fengfeng Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) was used to measure the changes. Intracellular pyridine nucleotides participate in processes such as respiratory metabolism and electron transfer. According to the the manufacturer’s instructions for NADP/NADPH Quantification Colorimetric Kit (Sigma Aldrich Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and NAD/NADH Quantification Colorimetric Kit (Sigma Aldrich Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), NADP (H) and NAD (H) were extracted from A. alternata treated mycelia. NADP + and NADPH were specifically detected and the NADPH/NADP + ratio was calculated with NADP/NADPH Quantification Colorimetric Kit, NAD + and NADH were specifically detected and the NADH/NAD + rati was calculated with NAD/NADH Quantification Colorimetric Kit. Cellular energy status is represented by the intracellular adenine nucleotide (ATP, ADP and AMP) content. ATP, ADP, and AMP were extracted and detected with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), of the key steps for extraction and detection mentioned above were performed with quantitative measurement kits (Solarbio Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.5 Statistic analysis For all the results reflecting antifungal activity and the control effect and those that verified the abundance of main metabolic components the mean were calculated using Excel 2013 software. All analysis of variance (ANOVA) of all data was performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). All results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (x ± SD). ANOVA was performed to identify significant differences between groups. After testing the assumptions of homoscedasticity, the Fisher least significant difference (LSD) test was employed to explore the effects of treatments and time on inhibition effect and metabolite content ( P = 0.05). Principal component analysis and nonmetric multidi-mensional scaling analysis were conducted using the R version 3.4.1 with a vegan package. 3 Results 3.1 Inhibitory effect of B. tequilensis against A. alternata and pear black spot disease 3.1.1 Antifungal activity of B. tequilensis against A. alternata On the laboratory scale, B. tequilensis exhibited antifungal activity against A. alternat a and inhibited mycelial growth ( Fig. 1 A-D). Microscopic observation showed that the mycelia treated with B. tequilensis were substantially aggregated, twisted, and entangled, while the blank control mycelia were smoother and more branched ( Fig. 1 E and F). This indicated that B. tequilensis affected the normal growth of mycelia. 3.1.2 Field control effect of B. tequilensis on pear black spot In the field, the disease index of the B. tequilensis treatment was much lower than that of the blank control treatment for three consecutive years ( Table 2 ). B. tequilensis controlled pear black spot on leaves in 2019, 2020, and 2021 by 89 %, 93 %, and 90 %, respectively, with an average control effect of 90 %. It controlled pear black spot on fruit by 96 %, 96 %, and 94 % in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, with an average control effect of 95 %. 3.2 Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of the effects of B. tequilensis against A. alternata 3.2.1 Transcriptomic analysis of A. alternata mycelia treated with B. tequilensis Transcriptomic analysis was completed and 52.03 Gb of clean data were obtained. More than 6.25 Gb of data for each sample were obtained, and the Q30 base percentage was greater than 94.5 %. The clean reads from each sample were subjected to sequence alignment with the designated reference genome, with the alignment rate ranging from 85.15 % to 86.80 %. The sequencing data have been submitted to the NCBI database (SRA access: PRJNA-962067). PCA of A. alternata following treatment with B. tequilensis and the blank control treatment was performed. The group treated with B. tequilensis and the blank control group were clearly separated, and samples from the same treatment groups were clustered ( Fig. 2 A). B. tequilensis thus had a significant impact on the transcriptome of A. alternata . According to differential expression analysis of the transcriptome, 2549 genes were significantly differentially expressed in A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis compared to control A. alternata ( Fig. 2 B), of which 1309 genes were downregulated, and 1249 genes were upregulated. The main differentially expressed genes were analysed to assess their involvement in typical KEGG signalling pathways( Fig. 2 C), including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, mutual pentose and glucuronic acid mutual transformation, oxidative phosphorylation, the citric acid (tricarboxylic acid, TCA) cycle, ethoxylate and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation mutual transformation, fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation,the cell cycle, the MAPK pathway, autophagy, the ribosome pathway, protein processing/output, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and amino acid and purine metabolism. 3.2.2 Metabolome analysis of the effect of B. tequilensis against A. alternata The differential abundance of metabolites in A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis was analysed; 869 components showed differential abundance ( Fig. 3 A), with 352 components showing decreased abundance and 517 components showing increased abundance. The metabolic pathways with the lowest p values and strongest pathway-influencing factors when the B. tequilensis treatment and blank control groups were compared were identified through enrichment analysis ( Fig. 3 B). These included pathways related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway, the cell cycle, pentose and glucuronic acid conversion, galactose metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and ABC transport. 3.2.3 Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of the effects of B. tequilensis against A. alternata Association and iPath analyses of the differentially expressed genes and metabolites of A. alternata after B. tequilensis treatment were performed. The transcriptomic and metabolomic data were enriched in six pathways, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ( Fig. 4 A), the TCA cycle ( Fig. 4 B), oxidative phosphorylation ( Fig. 4 C), the pentose phosphate pathway ( Fig. 4 D), pyrimidine metabolism ( Fig. 4 E) and the cell cycle ( Fig. 4 F). The results showed that glucose, a the reactant in the glycolysis pathway, affected the metabolism of pathogens ( Fig. 4 A). In the TCA cycle protons are transferred to the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), transforming it into NADH + H+, which continues to be oxidized in the respiratory chain to NAD to generate water, the results showed that these compounds were affected ( Fig. 4 B). Oxidative phosphorylation could not promote the conversion of ADP to ATP, and ATP was not coupled to electron transfer in the respiratory chain ( Fig. 4 C). The pentose phosphate pathway could not produce NADPH ( Fig. 4 D). The functions of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway ( Fig. 4 E) and cell cycle ( Fig. 4 F) were also correlated with the transcriptomic and metabolic data and were also affected. A joint transcriptomic/metabolomic map reflecting the effects of B. tequilensis against A. alternata was constructed, and certain correlations among the pathways were identified ( Fig. 5 ). These interactions mainly involved the conversion of glucose, the synthesis of citric acid, the intracellular pyridine nucleotides that engage in redox reactions and participate in biosynthesis, and adenine nucleotides that provide energy. These main pathways and their substances further affect pyrimidine metabolism and the cell growth cycle of A. alternata . 3.3 Verification of the main genes and metabolic components involved in the effects of B. tequilensis against A. alternata 3.3.1 Validation of the expression levels of genes in the main KEGG signalling pathways RT-PCR was performed with 18 genes involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, 12 genes involved in the interaction of the pentose phosphate pathway with glycolysis, 12 genes involved in the cell growth cycle, 8 genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, 8 genes involved in the TCA cycle, 8 genes involved in the interaction of glycolysis with oxidative phosphorylation, and 8 genes involved in MAPK signalling pathways. A total of 66 key genes were revealed, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9797. The changes in the expression trends of these genes were essentially consistent with the transcriptome data. ( Fig. 6 ). 3.3.2 Verification of the metabolic components of the main signalling pathway involved in the effects of B. tequilensis against A. alternata Effect of B. tequilensis on the glucose content of A. alternata : The glucose content of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis was 49.54 % lower than that of the blank control group ( Table 3 ). This result showed that A. alternata prioritized the use of this energy source against antagonists and thus reducing the energy available for growth. Effect of B. tequilensis on citric acid synthase in A. alternata : The cell citric acid content and citrate synthase activity were significantly decreased by more than 80 % in A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis ( Table 4 ), indicating that B. tequilensis inhibited the normal function of the TCA cycle pathway in A. alternata , which may have further affected the released ATP, NADH and oxidative phosphorylation electron transfer. Effects of B. tequilensis on the OCR of A. alternata : The OCR of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis decreased, with a maximum decrease of 89.50 % ( Fig. 7 A), indicating that B. tequilensis could inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in A. alternata . Effects of B. tequilensis on the intracellular pyridine nucleotide (NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH) content in A. alternata : B. tequilensis increased the NADH/NAD + ratio by 53.85 % in A. alternata , and the accumulation of NADH inhibited oxidative respiration in A. alternata . The NADPH/NADP + ratio decreased 93.24 %, and as NADPH is a reducing agent, this change affected synthesis and metabolism of the pathogen ( Fig. 7 B). Effects of B. tequilensis on the intracellular adenine nucleotide (ATP, ADP and AMP) content of A. alternata : The ATP levels of A. alternata treated with B. tequilensis decreased by 33.48 %, while the levels of both ADP and AMP increased by 42.33 % and 19.30 %, respectively ( Table 5 ). These results indicated that ATP generation by the oxidation of the electron transport chain was decreased to a certain extent and that intracellular ADP and AMP could not be converted to ATP in a timely manner. ADP and AMP accumulated to a certain extent, disrupting the intracellular adenine nucleotide balance and affecting metabolism. 4 Discussion As an important biocontrol bacterium, B. tequilensis has become a key agent in the control of plant pathogenic fungi due to its excellent inhibitory and control effects. No report on the mechanism underlying the effect of this biocontrol bacterium on A. alternata is available. This study preliminarily elucidated the antifungal activity and mechanism of B. tequilensis . This will guide the scientific use of this biocontrol bacterium based on the mechanism behind its biocontrol efficacy. B. tequilensis exhibited significant inhibitory effects against A. alternata and pear black spot. B. tequilensis inhibited mycelial growth, causing mycelial aggregation, twisting, and entanglement. B. tequilensis controlled pear black spot in the field by more than 90 %. Pradhan et al. (2013) preliminarily found that B. tequilensis exerts its inhibitory effects by destroying pathogenic mycelial biomembranes. These results are consistent with the effects of B. tequilensis observed in this study. In addition, Ma et al. (2012) found that B. tequilensis antagonizes A. alternata , Magnaporthe oryzae , Ralstonia solanacearum , and Fusarium oxysporum . B. tequilensis is a biologically antagonistic bacterium with high biocontrol potential. B. tequilensis affected gene expression and metabolite levels in A. alternata through six main correlated pathways: glycolysis, the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway, pyrimidine metabolism and the cell cycle. The glycolysis pathway is at the core of this overall network. Glucose 6-phosphate, the first intermediate metabolite formed in glycolysis, is an important node molecule that connects the pentose phosphate pathway and glucose metabolism ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). Li et al. (2023) and Zhao et al. (2023) reported that the downregulation of glycolysis pathway gene expression can cause changes in glucose conversion. The TCA cycle links amino acid or fat metabolism and glycolysis and participates in several signalling pathways, including the protein kinase A and AMPK pathways ( Tao et al., 2017 ). The TCA cycle is a key pathway involved in the response to fungicide toxicity ( Wang and Shen, 2016 ). Nordström (1963) reported that inhibition of the TCA cycle weakens the mitochondrial oxidation capacity and reduces the levels of acetyl-CoA, TCA, succinic acid and ATP. In this study, B. tequilensis significantly decreased the expression of genes in the A. alternata TCA cycle and the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinic acid. Additionally, B. tequilensis affected the oxidative phosphorylation pathway by inhibiting the transformation of NADH to NAD, the transformation of succinic acid to fumaric acid and the synthesis of ATP. SDHI fungicides were reported to act on succinate dehydrogenase, inhibit the transfer of electrons from succinate to ubiquinone, interfere with the electron transfer function of complex II on the respiratory chain, and prevent complex II from generating energy ( Bouillaud, 2023 ). B. tequilensis simultaneously acted on multiple sites in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in A. alternata , indicating a much more complex mechanism of action than that of SDHI fungicides. In addition, B. tequilensis blocked NADPH production in A. alternata and disrupted the pentose phosphate pathway. The fungicide cymoxanil fungicide also solely blocks oxidation and phosphorylation by inhibiting electron transfer in the mitochondria of pathogens ( Toffolatti et al., 2015 ). Effects on NADH, NADPH and ATP will lead to effects on the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway will also be affected ( Behrends et al., 2019 ). The above four basic metabolic pathways indirectly affect the overall pyrimidine metabolism pathway and the cell cycle of the pathogen. These findings indicate that B. tequilensis pathogenic activity through multiple targets. B. tequilensis has shown strong potential research and application value. It is necessary to continue analysing the relationships between the functional substances of B. tequilensis and the genes targeted by this pathogen. The inhibitory effects of Bacillus biocontrol agents depend on the complex and finely-tuned regulatory network between Bacillus and pathogens. It is necessary to gradually build a complete system to regulate the inhibitory effects of functional substances on their molecular targets at the molecular level to create targeted biocontrol inhibitors and achieve biological control of plant pathogens.
