    "full_text": "Metabolites of plant and microbial origin have a great influence on plant-microbe interactions. Members from Bacillus subtilis are known to produce a plethora of metabolites that shape plant responses towards biotic and abiotic stresses. Similarly, endophyte B. subtilis L1–21 efficiently controls the Huanglongbing (HLB) causing pathogen: Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus ( C Las). However, the molecular mechanisms are highly elusive. Herein, our study highlights the critical role of endophyte L1–21 in planta -produced surfactin in its colonization in citrus plants and regulation of plant-microbe interactions by comparing three gene knockout mutants △ srfAA -L1–21, △ sfp -L1–21, and △ pel -L1–21. All three mutants exhibited reduced pathogen control and colonization efficiency compared to wild-type (WT) L1–21, but knockout mutant deficient of surfactin △ srfAA -L1–21 was significantly impaired in the abovementioned functions as compared to △ sfp -L1–21 and △ pel -L1–21. Further, △ srfAA -L1–21 could not activate various metabolic pathways in citrus as WT-L1–21. Integrated metabolomic-transcriptomic analysis reveals that important secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, volatile organic compounds, and lignins were highly accumulated in citrus plants treated with WT-L1–21 as compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 , highlighting the role of surfactin as an elicitor of the defense system in citrus-HLB pathosystem. Interestingly, auxin-related metabolites and transcripts were also downregulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 compared to WT-L1–21 showing that surfactin might also influence plant-microbe interactions through metabolic reprogramming. Further, higher enrichment of Bacilli with WT-L1–21 might corresponds to surfactin-mediated regulation of community-related behavior in Bacilli. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the role of surfactin from Bacillus endophyte in metabolic reprogramming in citrus-HLB pathosystem and mounting defense response against C Las pathogen."

          "Plants form dynamic yet complex relationships with the microbial communities to establish a beneficial and sustainable system, where metabolites of plant and microbial origin play a vital role ( Su et al., 2023 ). Due to the intimate associations between the host plant and its microbiome, both partners synchronize their metabolism and co-produce specialized metabolites to maintain the physiological status, regulate plant growth, and combat biotic and abiotic stresses ( Mathur and Ulanova, 2023 ). Plants and microbes also influence each others activities through producing a set of metabolites. For example, plants produce a plethora of metabolites such as phytohormones, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), coumarins, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, and acids, which either act as signals to recruit a set of special microbial members or as a nutrient source ( Jo et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, microbes also produce phytohormones which regulate plant growth and some specialized compounds that act as elicitors for defense activation ( Mathur and Ulanova, 2023 ).",
          "Among other plant-associated microbes, Bacilli are widely employed as biocontrol agents known to produce elicitors that can induce different physiological responses in plants, such as the production of secondary metabolites involved in defense activation ( Ahmed et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2024 ). Cyclic lipopeptides produced from Bacilli are involved in direct antagonism against pathogens and also function as elicitors such as surfactins ( Stoll et al., 2021 ). The synthesis of surfactin occurs non-ribosomally and srfA operon directs it through a multimodular megaenzyme. The compound is particularly interesting due to its multifunctionality in important functions such as bacterial motility, biofilm formation, colonization, and as a signaling molecule employed in bacterial quorum sensing ( Hoff et al., 2021 ). Previous studies have reported the activation of defense (induced systemic resistance, ISR) in Solanaceae like tobacco and tomato by Bacillus sp., where surfactin was the main elicitor ( Ongena and Jacques, 2008; Pršić and Ongena, 2020 ).",
          "Bacillus subtilis L1–21, an endophyte isolated from an asymptomatic Huanglongbing (HLB)-infected citrus tree, has shown exceptional biocontrol potential against Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus ( C Las) ( Munir et al., 2022a ). Citrus species are considered important for their great economic value worldwide due to their nutritional profile, contribution to foreign exchange, and industrialization ( Bamisile et al., 2020 ). Unfortunately, the phloem-limited bacteria C Las has been causing havoc in citrus production. In this scenario, endophyte-mediated biocontrol has offered a great solution to control the pathogen, yielding satisfactory results at field level. The endophyte L1–21 efficiently colonizes the citrus phloem, a common niche of the C Las pathogen ( Munir et al., 2022b ). Therefore, the colonization of this endophyte might play a crucial role in operating other biocontrol mechanisms that remain largely elusive.",
          "An in-depth knowledge is critical to not only understand the underlying biocontrol mechanism of endophyte L1–21 but also its efficient use against citrus pathogens. Endophyte L1–21 produces surfactin, fengycin, bacilysin, and bacillaene, and the culture filtrate has shown a significant control effect against Penicillium digitatum , a post-harvest pathogen of citrus fruits ( Li et al., 2022 ). Genome analysis of endophyte L1–21 also reveals the presence of genetic elements encoding for surfactin production and 4’-phosphopantetheinyl transferas (PPTase) required to produce these active lipopeptides. Here, we investigated the role of several genetic elements either directly or indirectly associated with colonization including surfactin, PPTase, and pectate lyase by knocking out the corresponding genes srfAA , sfp, and pel from the endophyte L1–21, respectively. Further, we employed srfAA knockout mutant (△ srfAA -L1–21) to prove that loss of surfactin in endophyte L1–21 impairs its ability to activate several important pathways and production of secondary metabolites in citrus plants, involved in defense. This study provides a new molecular insight into endophyte L1–21 operated biocontrol mechanisms against C Las pathogen."

For sfp knockout vector, the gene was amplified by sfp F/R ( Table S1 ) using L1–21 genome as a template and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product and the pBluescipt KS minus were digested by Eco RI/ Kpn I followed by the ligation. The kan R fragment recovered by Hin dIII digestion was ligated to pBluescipt KS minus- sfp ( Figure S1 ).

              "Due to the non-culturability of the C Las pathogen, it is impossible to study the antagonistic action of biocontrol agents via in vitro confrontation assays. Therefore, the novel-half leaf method was used to assess the performance of mutants compared with WT-L1–21 against the C Las pathogen. The diseased leaves ( Citrus sinensis ) were randomly collected from a diseased grove (5-year-old trees) located in Binchuan, Dali City, Yunnan Province, China (100.5754° E, 25.8272° N) and brought to the laboratory in an icebox and used immediately or stored at 4℃ till further use. The novel-half leaf assay was performed following the protocol reported by Munir et al., (2022b) . Briefly, total DNA was extracted following the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method ( Araújo et al., 2002 ) from one-half of the leaf. After confirming the C Las infection in leaves through qPCR (as mentioned below), the other half of the leaves were treated with 10 6 CFU/mL of △ srfAA- L1–21 , △ sfp- L1–21 , △ pel- L1–21 , and WT-L1–21 while LB broth and water were used as control. At room temperature, the treated leaves were kept in 180 mm petri plates for 5 days. Each treatment comprised of 3 replicates, each with 7 leaves (random top and bottoms of each leaf). Samples were retrieved at 1-day intervals till 5 days, and DNA was extracted from leaf mid-rib. The weight of each sample was recorded prior to DNA extraction. Afterward, pathogen density (copies g ‐1 ) in each treatment was calculated using qPCR analysis based on the standard curve ( Munir et al., 2022b ). The PCR reaction was performed in a 25 μl reaction mixture containing 1X PCR buffer (SYBR Green Master Mix; Bio-Rad, United States), 1 μl of each primer (CQULA04R/CQULA04F), and the appropriate amount of DNA template in an RT-PCR system (Step One Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems, United States) as previously reported ( Wang et al., 2006 ). Changes in pathogen titer were recorded from 0 to 5 days based on pathogen copies per gram of citrus leaf, which were calculated with standard curve and CT values. The experiment was repeated three times."

Firstly, half of the leaves from every treatment were tested for C Las pathogen with qPCR following the protocol in the section 2.3 and the total endophytes were isolated ( Araújo et al., 2002 ). Briefly, the other half of the leaves were treated with 10 6 CFU/mL of mutants and WT-L1–21 while LB broth and water served as control. Samples were processed at 1-day intervals till 5 days. The leaves were first washed thoroughly with sterilized water and then surface sterilized with 70 % ethanol for 30 seconds, followed by rinsing with sterilized water. The last wash was plated on an LB agar plate to validate the efficiency of the sterilization process. The half-leaves from each treatment were weighed and ground in sterilized mortar and pestle under sterile conditions. The homogenate was evenly spread on LB agar plates and incubated at 28 ℃ for 24–48 hours, and total endophytes (CFU/g) were recorded for each treatment at intervals of 1–5 days.

Briefly, the homogenates acquired from samples processed in Section 2.5 were plated on LB agar plates (1.5 % Bacto agar) and incubated at 37 ℃ for 24 hours. The colony-forming units of each mutant and WT-L1–21 were calculated as CFU/g of the leaf at intervals of 1–5 days. The CFU/g was considered the colonization efficiency for each mutant and was compared to the WT-L1–21. Further, the swarm expansion assay with slight modifications was performed to assess the difference in swarming motility of WT-L1–21 and its derived mutants ( Sanchez et al., 2021 ). Fresh cultures of WT-L1–21, △ sfp- L1–21, △ srfAA -L1–21, and △ pel -L1–21 were grown in LB media to mid-log phase and resuspended in phosphate saline buffer (pH 8) to OD 600 =1.0. In total, 5 μl was inoculated in the center of the plate containing LB media with 0.7 % Bacto agar and the plates were dried open-faced in Laminar flow hood for 10 minutes. The swarm diameters were measured after 6 hours, and each treatment consisted of three replicates containing five plates."

Therefore, several important genes ( sfp, pel, and srfAA) were knocked out from endophyte L1–21 to evaluate their contribution towards the pathogen control. The results of the novel half-leaf assay showed that each mutant performed differently during the experiment as compared with WT-L1–21. The pathogen copies were higher in citrus leaves treated with all the mutants, which signifies that gene deletion reduced the pathogen control efficiency of endophyte L1–21 ( Fig. 1 A). Although till Day 4, similar pathogen titers were recorded in △ pel- L1–21 and WT-L1–21 treated leaves, but at Day 5, △ pel- L1–21 treated leaves had higher pathogen density as compared to the WT-L1–21 treated leaves ( Fig. 1 B). Citrus leaves treated with WT-L1–21 had lowest pathogen load while LB treated leaves showed highest pathogen copies ( Fig. 1 C). Whereas, both mutants (△ srfAA -L1–21 and △ sfp -L1–21) with surfactin production defect showed reduced control of C Las pathogen compared with WT-L1–21. This highlights that colonization of endophyte L1–21 plays a vital role in pathogen control through niche and nutrient competition. In addition, all the mutants were still able to reduce C Las copies in citrus leaf as compared with LB and water control. However, no significant difference was recorded in pathogen reduction in △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 which shows that elimination of both genes had a similar effect on the pathogen control activity of endophyte L1–21 ( Fig. 1 D) .

Citrus leaves treated with WT-L1–21 harbored the highest number of total endophytes as compared to all the treatments. Interestingly, the total endophytes in△ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 treated citrus leaves, were lower than the other treatments ( Fig. 2 A). In contrast, citrus leaves treated with △ pel- L1–21 had a higher number of total endophytes as compared with △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 but lower than the WT-L1–21 at day 5 ( Fig. 2 B). However, the fluctuations were also recorded among treatments at various time points. For instance, at Day 1, the total number of endophytes were lower in △ pel- L1–21 - treated citrus leaves than in the △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 treated leaves and gradually increased until day 5. The trend was the opposite for both mutant treatments at Day 5 ( Fig. 2 B). While, there was no significant increase recorded for number of total endophytes in water and LB control treatments ( Fig. 2 C). Similarly, no significant difference was recorded for the △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 on total endophytes from citrus leaves ( Fig. 2 D), even though △ sfp- L1–21 was expected to produce a higher negative effect. However, both mutants (△ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21) exhibited similar behaviors highlighting the potential role of surfactin."

              "In order to compare the colonization efficiency of mutants with WT-L1–21, the strains were re-isolated from the treated citrus leaves. In this regard, the lowest colonization efficiency was recorded for △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 compared with △ pel- L1–21 and WT-L1–21 ( Fig. 3 A-B). Surfactin-deficient mutants △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 could not colonize as efficiently as WT-L1–21 and unexpectedly both mutants showed similar performance ( Fig. 3 C). Therefore, it can be anticipated that colonization and establishment of endophyte L1–21 in citrus tissue are partly controlled by surfactin production and surfactin is one of the most important lipopetides produced by endophyte L1–21. On the other hand, the re-isolated CFU/g value for△ pel- L1–21 was higher than surfactin-related mutant treatments but lower than WT-L1–21 ( Fig. 3 A) which highlights that pectate lyase enzyme is also involved in the colonization but more drastic effect on colonization efficiency was recorded for △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 .",
              "Furthermore, a swarm expansion assay was conducted to assess the effect of gene knockouts on swarming motility. After 6 hours, the swarm zones of WT-L1–21 and△ pel- L1–21 did not exhibit any significant difference ( Fig. 4 A), while the swarm zones of both surfactin deficient mutants△ srfAA- L1–21 and△ sfp- L1–21 were almost three times reduced ( p <0.0001) ( Fig. 4 B). The reduction in swarm expansion in both surfactin-related mutants indicates the involvement of surfactin in swarming motility of endophyte L1–21 but pectate lyase seems to perform no role in the motility. Although the swarm zones of △ srfAA -L1–21 and △ sfp -L1–21 showed no significant difference indicating that surfactin is the key lipopeptide affecting motility and colonization. Therefore, △ srfAA -L1–21 was used for further analysis to dissect the involvement of surfactin in the biocontrol mechanism of endophyte L1–21 against C Las pathogen."

              "Differential regulation patterns for several important metabolites were recorded among diseased citrus plants treated with WT-L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21. compared to healthy and diseased plants. The application of WT-L1–21 induced various metabolic pathways which resulted in the higher production of vital metabolites in diseased citrus plant belonging to several classes such as organic acids, hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives, amino acids, isoflavones, flavonols, coumarins, and benzoic acid derivatives ( Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, important secondary metabolites such as shikimic acid, azelaic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, daidzein, chrysoeriol-related compounds, and several others were highly enriched in diseased citrus plants treated with WT-L1–21 as compared with un-treated diseased citrus. In contrast, L-pipecolic acid, 2-picolinic acid, ferulic acid, and a major component of phenylpropanoid pathway: L-phenylalanine were reduced in △ srfAA -L1–21 compared to WT-L1–21 treated diseased plants. All these metabolites are known to be directly involved in pathogen inhibition or as intermediates in the pathway related to disease resistance in plants. These results highlight that a deficiency of surfactin could not elicit metabolic reprogramming in diseased citrus as efficiently as WT-L1–21, which signifies that surfactin might be involved in microbe-plant interactions and defence activation as an elicitor. Although, △ srfAA -L1–21 could not induce many important metabolites, some metabolites such as vanillic acid, quercetin 5-O-malonylhexosyl-hexoside, and genistein were enriched as compared with diseased citrus plant which shows that the gene knockout did not entirely disarmed endophyte L1–21 for its biocontrol efficiency ( Fig. 5 A).",
              "Further, two hormones serotonin and melatonin were highly enriched in WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants, which indicates a possible role of these two hormones in metabolic cross-talk among plant beneficial microbes and their hosts. Moreover, other compounds involved in the biosynthesis of a class of hormone: indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were also found to be differentially regulated in all treatments. For instance, in WT-L1–21 treated diseased citrus plants, L-tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and indole-5-carboxylic acid were highly enriched as compared with plants treated △ srfAA -L1–21. However, exceptionally two metabolites such as indole and indole-3-carboxaldehyde were also enriched in △ srfAA -L1–21 ( Fig. 5 B). While most of these metabolites were reduced in un-treated diseased plants as compared with other treatments. The differential regulation of these metabolites shows that surfactin may perform various functions in plant-microbe interactions other than the direct antagonism against pathogen. Moreover, three VOCs namely, limonin, trans-2-hexanal, and dihydrojasmone were abundant in WT-L1–21 treated citrus plants as compared with un-treated diseased plants. At the same time, △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants had high quantity of these VOCs as compared with diseased plants but lower than WT-L1–21 treated diseased plants ( Fig. 5 C)."

              "Endophyte WT-L1–21 and its mutant strain △ srfAA -L1–21 differentially regulated the transcriptome of diseased citrus plants, thereby important pathways related to the detected metabolites were selected for further analysis ( Fig. 6 ). In total, three comparison groups: HCK vs DCK, DCK vs WT-L1–21, and DCK vs △ srfAA -L1–21 were used to analyze the transcript enrichment patterns in the treatments. Briefly, transcripts encoding key enzymes from shikimic acid pathway: shikimate kinase and shikimate dehydrogenase, and phenylpropanoid pathway: phenyl (PHE) ammonia lyase 1, 4-coumarate: CoA ligase 2, and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase were found to be significantly upregulated in WT-L1–21 treated diseased citrus plants as compared with un-treated diseased plants. These transcripts were found to be downregulated in un-treated diseased plants as compared with healthy plants showing that pathogen might deactivate these pathways to establish the disease. Interestingly, most of the transcripts were also downregulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 as compared to WT-L1–21 treated citrus plants. These results corroborate the differential synthesis of secondary metabolites in all treatments, as discussed in the above section ( Fig. 6 A). Further, the transcript encoding important enzyme flavonol synthase involved in flavonol synthesis was also highly expressed in WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 and un-treated diseased citrus plants. Similarly, two other important enzymes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase and lipoxygenase 2 from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate pathway and lipoxygenase pathway, respectively were also induced in WT-L1–21 treated citrus as compared with other treatments ( Fig. 6 A). The differential regulation of important transcripts and metabolites corroborates with the higher pathogen reduction in citrus plants with the application of WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 where the pathogen titer was higher than the WT-L1–21 treated diseased plants. Further, qRT-PCR was performed to validate the RNA-seq data with six differentially expressed transcripts among all treatments ( Figure S4 ).",
              "Moreover, auxin biosynthesis and transport-related transcripts were also differentially regulated among the treatments. We found four transcripts encoding tryptophan synthase, indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase, auxin efflux carrier family protein, and auxin-responsive GH3 family protein to be more upregulated in WT-L1–21 treated plants as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21. In contrast, only one transcript related to indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase was also slightly upregulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 compared with un-treated diseased plant, whereas all transcripts other than auxin-responsive GH3 family protein were downregulated in diseased control plants as compared with healthy plants ( Fig. 6 B). These insights from transcriptome further confirm the variations in the important metabolites detected from un-targeted metabolome analysis at the molecular level."

The pathogen was higher in un-treated diseased plants after seven days, and there was no significant difference recorded. Whereas, treatment of WT-L1–21 significantly reduced the pathogen titer in diseased citrus plants ( p <0.0001) as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants. The mutant showed reduced efficiency for pathogen control as compared with WT-L1–21 ( Fig. 6 C) and the results were similar to those recorded in half-leaf assay. Further, endophytes are known to recruit other members and regulate the microbiome assembly by modulating plant metabolic profiles or hormones. In this regard, Bacilli enrichment was assessed in all the treatments and higher Bacilli were present in WT-L1–21 compared to un-treated and △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants ( Fig. 6 D). The higher enrichment of Bacilli with WT-L1–21 might corresponds to the surfactin QS molecule which regulates community-related behavior in Bacilli or due to the upregulation of plant IAA."

          "Endophytes are ubiquitous in all plants and considered an integral member of plant microbiomes. They are known for their attributes such as plant growth promotion and protection against various stresses ( Ahmed et al., 2024 ). Although researchers have reported several mechanisms such as direct antagonism, competition, and induction of plant resistance ( Munir et al., 2022a; Singh et al., 2023 ), but the knowledge gaps still exist due to the complexity of the tripartite interactions among host plant-microbe-pathogen. Herein, our study validates the biocontrol efficiency of endophyte L1–21 against citrus HLB disease and role of surfactin in mitigating the deadly pathogen. Surfactin has been reported for various functions such as motility, biofilm formation, and as a signal molecule which are important features for microbial colonization in host plant. In this regard, several mutants related to colonization such as △ sfp -L1–21, △ srfAA -L1–21, and △ pel -L1–21 were assessed to understand whether these genetic elements of endophyte L1–21 are involved in C Las pathogen control in citrus. The C Las pathogen copies were drastically reduced in WT-L1–21 as compared with all the mutants tested. The decline in pathogen reduction efficiency was more prominent in △ srfAA -L1–21 and△ sfp -L1–21 than the △ pel -L1–21 ( Fig. 1 ). Here, it was expected that △ sfp -L1–21 would exhibit drastic decline in performance due to absence of PPTase which is required for the production of active lipopeptides. In contrast, both the mutants (△ srfAA -L1–21 and△ sfp -L1–21) showed similar performance highlighting that surfactin is the key lipopeptides involved in biocontrol activity of endophyte L1–21 ( Fig. 1 D). Similarly, a study reported that mutant of B. subtilis 9407 deficient in surfactin production could not antagonize the bacterial pathogen Acidovorax citrulli both in vitro and in planta . The mutant also showed reduced biofilm formation and colonization in plant host ( Fan et al., 2017 ).",
          "Further, total endophytes in citrus plants also varied in all treatments and were recorded highest in WT-L1–21 and lowest in △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21. While △ pel -L1–21 treated citrus plants also had lower number of total endophytes as compared with WT-L1–21 but were higher than in △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 treated citrus plants ( Fig. 2 A). It is noteworthy that surfactin is a small signal molecule which regulates quorum sensing response for biofilm formation and sporulation. A study also reported that surfactin deficient Bacillus cell died due to inability to metabolize carbon sources other than the glucose ( Chen et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it might be possible that surfactin deficiency affected endophytic community due to inefficient regulation of functions related to multicellularity or cooperative behavior in a complex microbial community. It is also reported that surfactins are used as public goods, and Bacilli can use the surfactins produced by other closely related Bacillus species ( Lyons and Kolter, 2017 ). It is likely possible that production of surfactin from WT-L1–21 regulates the colonization patterns and metabolic preferences of other microbes especially Bacilli. However, in △ pel -L1–21 treated plants, endophytes were also lower despite of the presence of sfp and srfAA genes ( Fig. 2 B). There are two possibilities: firstly, degradation products from pectate lyase could involve in Bacilli enrichment as a study reported that pectin molecules stimulated the production of surfactin which regulates mutualistic interactions of Bacilli and its host ( Hoff et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the total endophytes isolated were higher in WT-L1–21 than in △ pel -L1–21. Secondly, absence of pectate lyase encoding gene in △ pel -L1–21 reduced its colonization in citrus, which resulted in reduced total endophytes as Bacilli could be a major fraction of total endophytes. Because pectate lyase enzyme is involved in degrading pectate; a constituent of cell wall which possibly helps endophytic bacteria to penetrate and colonize in plant tissues ( Taghavi et al., 2010 ).",
          "To this end, we further re-isolated the applied WT-L1–21 and mutants from citrus leaves. Expectedly, the re-isolated CFU/g of WT-L1–21 was higher than all the mutants ( Fig. 3 ), while being lowest for △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 ( Fig. 3 C) which signifies that these mutants were unable to colonize host efficiently. Whereas, the re-isolated CFU/g of △ pel -L1–21 was lower than WT-L1–21 but it was still higher than other two surfactin deficient mutants highlighting the major role of surfactin in colonization of citrus host and enrichment of other Bacilli for mitigating C Las pathogen. The role of surfactin has been reported for the swarming motility of bacteria, and it is correlated with the colonization in the host plant and the establishment of symbiotic relationships ( Newton et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the swarming motility was tested in in vitro assay and the both surfactin deficient mutants showed reduced swarm zones compared to WT-L1–21 and △ pel -L1–21 ( Fig. 4 ). The reduced swarming in △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 is in agreement with the lower colonization in citrus leaves.",
          "Intriguingly, △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 did not show significant difference in terms of pathogen reduction, colonization, and enrichment of endophytes in citrus leave. Although, △ sfp -L1–21 which is deficient of all NRPs (Surfactin, fengycin, and bacillibactin; data not shown), was expected to have reduced efficiency than △ srfAA -L1–21, that is unable to produce surfactin only. Because sfp encodes PPTase: a key enzyme essential for non-ribosomal synthesis of cyclic lipopeptides and synthesis of polyketides. As reported, B. subtilis 168 could not produce surfactin, plipastatin or bacillaene due to the inactive sfp gene and the production was restored by transforming a functional ectopic copy of sfp ( Harwood et al., 2018 ). Here, it can be anticipated that surfactin plays a significant role in biocontrol efficiency of endophyte L1–21. Therefore, we further dissected the underlying mechanisms of L1–21-produced surfactin by comparing the metabolome profiles of WT-L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased citrus plants and the transcripts were also validated for the regulated pathways.",
          "Various important metabolites were differentially regulated in WT-L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants compared to un-treated diseased citrus plants ( Fig. 5 ). For instance, a higher accumulation of shikimic acid was recorded in WT-L1–21 treated citrus compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 treated and un-treated diseased plants. Shikimic acid is a key metabolite from shikimic acid pathway which forms a bridge between sugar metabolism and synthesis of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) and secondary metabolites ( Shende et al., 2024 ). In relevance, transcripts encoding shikimate dehydrogenase and shikimate kinase 1 were more up-regulated in plants treated with WT-L1–21 (log2-FC= 2.24; log2-FC=3.3) as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 (log2-FC=0.00; log2-FC= 2.77) treated and un-treated diseased plant (log2-FC= −2.18; log2-FC= −6.25) ( Fig. 6 A, Table S3 ). The aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, a final product of shikimic acid pathway, is a key component and precursor of phenylpropanoid pathway was relatively higher in WT-L1–21 as compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 treated and un-treated diseased plants. The higher accumulation of L-phenylalanine highlights the induction of phenylpropanoid pathway which provides a rich source of various secondary metabolites important for plant development and defense. In concordance, two transcripts of PAL gene encoding phenyl ammonia lyase 1 was also highly induced in WT-L1–21 (log2-FC = 14.2, 6.34) as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 (log2-FC = 2.80, 1.45) and diseased plant (log2-FC = −10.26, −7.05). PAL catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamate and directs the carbon flow from shikimic acid pathway to the general phenylpropanoid pathway ( Fig. 7 ). This pathway is well understood for mounting plant disease resistance against invading pathogen. A recent study also reported the upregulation of PAL and other genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway by application of microbial fermentation product in C. sinensis infected with HLB ( Lally et al., 2021 ). Our results highlight the activation of key metabolic pathways in citrus by WT-L1–21 but, interestingly △ srfAA -L1–21 could not induce the selected metabolites and related transcripts to the similar extent as the WT-L1–21. These insights signify the contribution of surfactin produced from endophyte L1–21 in mounting the resistance against C Las pathogen in citrus plants.",
          "Similarly, various important secondary metabolites from phenylpropanoid pathway such as cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, and chlorogenic acid were also differentially regulated among all the treatments. These metabolites are known for their antioxidants and antimicrobial properties against pathogenic bacteria. Further, the pathway extends to the synthesis of isoflavonoids and flavonoids, such as several related to quercetin and chrysoeriol-related compounds well-known for antibacterial properties ( Lally et al., 2021 ) were highly accumulated in WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 treated plants and un-treated diseased plants ( Fig. 5 ), which correlates with the accumulation of their precursors as discussed above. A higher concentration of metabolites such as flavonoids, terpenes, and aldehydes have been found in citrus varieties tolerant to HLB ( Lally et al., 2021; Munir et al., 2022a ), highlighting the role of WT-L1–21 in metabolic reprogramming towards resistance. Moreover, the transcripts related to the important enzymes from the pathway, such as: 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate, and flavonol synthase were relatively up-regulated in WT-L1–21 while down-regulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 treated citrus plants. Interestingly, transcripts for two key enzymes: cinnamoyl- CoA reductase 1 and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 6 involved in lignin synthesis were also up-regulated in WT-L1–21 treated plants (log2-FC= 2.64; log2-FC= 7.0), while both transcripts were not regulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 as compared with un-treated diseased plants ( Fig. 6 A) highlighting the role of lignin in C Las control. A study reported that early C Las infection suppresses the formation of lignin and restoration of this pathway may control pathogen spread because plants employ lignification and reinforcement of cell walls as a defense strategy against pathogen ( Bo et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2023 ). Lignin synthesis genes were also upregulated in HLB-tolerant Australian finger lime compared to HLB-susceptible ‘Valencia’ sweet orange ( Weber et al., 2022 ). These findings reveal that WT-L1–21 application in diseased citrus confers resistance through activation of lignin synthesis and surfactin may play a role in host-microbe crosstalk as evident through the failure of △ srfAA -L1–21 in producing similar plant responses. Our results also found several VOCs to be differentially regulated among treatments, such as 2-hexanal produced in the lipoxygenase pathway, which was found to induce a subset of defense-related genes in Arabidopsis ( Bate and Rothstein, 1998; Matsui and Engelberth, 2022 ). The transcript encoding lipoxygenase was also upregulated in WT-L1–21 treated plants than the other treatments which further supports the higher production of volatiles in presence of WT-L1–21 but not in △ srfAA -L1–21 ( Fig. 6 A, Fig. 7 ). The activation of the important pathways correlated with the reduced pathogen density recorded in diseased citrus plants treated with WT-L1–21 compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 and un-treated diseased plants ( Fig. 6 C).",
          "Plant hormones are key regulatory elements that control various physiological functions in plants, including defense responses and even microbiome assembly ( Eichmann et al., 2021 ). Interestingly, several metabolites related to IAA, an important auxin, were found to be higher in WT-L1–21 compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased citrus plants ( Fig. 5 C). Similarly, transcripts related to auxin synthesis and perception were also differentially regulated in all treatments, supporting the results of metabolomic changes in citrus ( Fig. 6 B). A genome-wide association analysis revealed auxins to be one of the genetic elements linked with microbiome assembly ( Brachi et al., 2022 ), and even in maintaining the Bacillus -biofilms to promote beneficial interactions with host plants ( Ganin et al., 2019 ). The differential regulation of IAA in our study might be linked to the enrichment of endophytes in WT-L1–21 inoculated plants but not in △ srfAA -L1–21 in half-leaf assay. To further prove this, higher enrichment of Bacilli was observed in healthy and WT-L1–21 treated diseased plants, while fewer Bacilli were present in △ srfAA -L1–21 ( Fig. 6 D). The result supports our hypothesis that the introduction of an endophyte may enrich other microbial members by direct communication through quorum sensing, where surfactin also acts as a signaling molecule or indirectly regulates the microbial assembly by modulating the plant metabolome."

          "The study provides new molecular insight into the biocontrol mechanism and role of surfactin from endophyte L1–21 against C Las pathogen by comparing three knockout mutants △ srfAA -L1–21, △ sfp -L1–21, and △ pel -L1–21. Two mutants, △ srfAA -L1–21 and△ sfp -L1–21 showed similar patterns in reduced efficiency against C Las pathogen control, endophyte enrichment, and colonization in citrus leaf. Contrarily, △ pel -L1–21 did not exhibit reduced efficiency as other mutants, highlighting the key role of surfactin. Surfactin has been known for its involvement in biofilm formation, colonization, and as a signaling molecule, but it may also govern complex interactions among introduced endophytes, host plants, and other microbial members. In relevance, our results document the higher accumulation of several key metabolites and their related transcripts in WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 treated plants, which highlights that endophyte L1–21 employs surfactin as its biocontrol toolkit to mitigate C Las in citrus ( Fig. 8 ). Based on our findings, surfactin serves several key roles: firstly, it is crucial for the establishment of endophyte L1–21 in citrus tissue. Secondly, it may act as a signaling molecule that promotes the enrichment of other Bacilli, as evidenced by the higher culturable endophyte number in WT-L1–21. Thirdly, surfactin acts as an elicitor, activating various key metabolic pathways that mount resistance against C Las."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Plants form dynamic yet complex relationships with the microbial communities to establish a beneficial and sustainable system, where metabolites of plant and microbial origin play a vital role ( Su et al., 2023 ). Due to the intimate associations between the host plant and its microbiome, both partners synchronize their metabolism and co-produce specialized metabolites to maintain the physiological status, regulate plant growth, and combat biotic and abiotic stresses ( Mathur and Ulanova, 2023 ). Plants and microbes also influence each others activities through producing a set of metabolites. For example, plants produce a plethora of metabolites such as phytohormones, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), coumarins, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, and acids, which either act as signals to recruit a set of special microbial members or as a nutrient source ( Jo et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, microbes also produce phytohormones which regulate plant growth and some specialized compounds that act as elicitors for defense activation ( Mathur and Ulanova, 2023 ). Among other plant-associated microbes, Bacilli are widely employed as biocontrol agents known to produce elicitors that can induce different physiological responses in plants, such as the production of secondary metabolites involved in defense activation ( Ahmed et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2024 ). Cyclic lipopeptides produced from Bacilli are involved in direct antagonism against pathogens and also function as elicitors such as surfactins ( Stoll et al., 2021 ). The synthesis of surfactin occurs non-ribosomally and srfA operon directs it through a multimodular megaenzyme. The compound is particularly interesting due to its multifunctionality in important functions such as bacterial motility, biofilm formation, colonization, and as a signaling molecule employed in bacterial quorum sensing ( Hoff et al., 2021 ). Previous studies have reported the activation of defense (induced systemic resistance, ISR) in Solanaceae like tobacco and tomato by Bacillus sp., where surfactin was the main elicitor ( Ongena and Jacques, 2008; Pršić and Ongena, 2020 ). Bacillus subtilis L1–21, an endophyte isolated from an asymptomatic Huanglongbing (HLB)-infected citrus tree, has shown exceptional biocontrol potential against Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus ( C Las) ( Munir et al., 2022a ). Citrus species are considered important for their great economic value worldwide due to their nutritional profile, contribution to foreign exchange, and industrialization ( Bamisile et al., 2020 ). Unfortunately, the phloem-limited bacteria C Las has been causing havoc in citrus production. In this scenario, endophyte-mediated biocontrol has offered a great solution to control the pathogen, yielding satisfactory results at field level. The endophyte L1–21 efficiently colonizes the citrus phloem, a common niche of the C Las pathogen ( Munir et al., 2022b ). Therefore, the colonization of this endophyte might play a crucial role in operating other biocontrol mechanisms that remain largely elusive. An in-depth knowledge is critical to not only understand the underlying biocontrol mechanism of endophyte L1–21 but also its efficient use against citrus pathogens. Endophyte L1–21 produces surfactin, fengycin, bacilysin, and bacillaene, and the culture filtrate has shown a significant control effect against Penicillium digitatum , a post-harvest pathogen of citrus fruits ( Li et al., 2022 ). Genome analysis of endophyte L1–21 also reveals the presence of genetic elements encoding for surfactin production and 4’-phosphopantetheinyl transferas (PPTase) required to produce these active lipopeptides. Here, we investigated the role of several genetic elements either directly or indirectly associated with colonization including surfactin, PPTase, and pectate lyase by knocking out the corresponding genes srfAA , sfp, and pel from the endophyte L1–21, respectively. Further, we employed srfAA knockout mutant (△ srfAA -L1–21) to prove that loss of surfactin in endophyte L1–21 impairs its ability to activate several important pathways and production of secondary metabolites in citrus plants, involved in defense. This study provides a new molecular insight into endophyte L1–21 operated biocontrol mechanisms against C Las pathogen. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions Bacillus subtilis L1–21, previously isolated from asymptomatic HLB-infected citrus leaf, has been preserved in 40 % glycerol (v/v) at -80 ºC in Molecular Plant Pathology Lab, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China. A pure culture of endophyte L1–21 was cultivated until the late log phase in Luria-Bertani (LB) (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl per liter) broth at 37 ± 1 °C at 160 rpm for 24–48 h. While mutants: △ sfp- L1–21, △ pel- L1–21, and △ srfAA -L1–21 used in this study were cultured in LB supplemented with kanamycin 30 μg/mL. All the reagents and antibiotics used in the study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA unless otherwise specified. 2.2 Construction of different gene knockouts The genes sfp (gene encoding PPTase) and srfAA (the first gene from surfactin biosynthesis gene cluster srfAA, srfAB, SrfAC, and SrfAD ) involved in surfactin production, were selected for the disruption by inserting kanamycin fragment (kan R ). For sfp knockout vector, the gene was amplified by sfp F/R ( Table S1 ) using L1–21 genome as a template and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product and the pBluescipt KS minus were digested by Eco RI/ Kpn I followed by the ligation. The kan R fragment recovered by Hin dIII digestion was ligated to pBluescipt KS minus- sfp ( Figure S1 ). For srfAA knockout mutant, the knockout vector pMD18-AKA(Bsu) ( Xia et al., 2024 ) was acquired from our laboratory. The both knockout vectors were transformed in Escherichia coli TG1 cells ( Hanahan, 1983 ). The positive transformants were screened on ampicillin-supplemented LB plates and confirmed with PCR using kanamycin targeting primers ( Table S1 ). The linearized plasmids pBluescipt KS minus- sfp K and pMD18-AKA(Bsu) were integrated into the L1–21 genome by double-crossover recombination ( Wu et al., 2014 ), yielding the knockout mutants △ sfp- L1–21, and △ srfAA -L1–21, respectively and were confirmed with gene and kanamycin targeting primers ( Figure S2, S3 , Table S1 ). While, △ pel -L1–21 (deficient in pectate lyase) was obtained from Molecular Plant Pathology Lab, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China. 2.3 Pathogen reduction efficiency of knockout mutants-half leaf assay Due to the non-culturability of the C Las pathogen, it is impossible to study the antagonistic action of biocontrol agents via in vitro confrontation assays. Therefore, the novel-half leaf method was used to assess the performance of mutants compared with WT-L1–21 against the C Las pathogen. The diseased leaves ( Citrus sinensis ) were randomly collected from a diseased grove (5-year-old trees) located in Binchuan, Dali City, Yunnan Province, China (100.5754° E, 25.8272° N) and brought to the laboratory in an icebox and used immediately or stored at 4℃ till further use. The novel-half leaf assay was performed following the protocol reported by Munir et al., (2022b) . Briefly, total DNA was extracted following the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method ( Araújo et al., 2002 ) from one-half of the leaf. After confirming the C Las infection in leaves through qPCR (as mentioned below), the other half of the leaves were treated with 10 6 CFU/mL of △ srfAA- L1–21 , △ sfp- L1–21 , △ pel- L1–21 , and WT-L1–21 while LB broth and water were used as control. At room temperature, the treated leaves were kept in 180 mm petri plates for 5 days. Each treatment comprised of 3 replicates, each with 7 leaves (random top and bottoms of each leaf). Samples were retrieved at 1-day intervals till 5 days, and DNA was extracted from leaf mid-rib. The weight of each sample was recorded prior to DNA extraction. Afterward, pathogen density (copies g ‐1 ) in each treatment was calculated using qPCR analysis based on the standard curve ( Munir et al., 2022b ). The PCR reaction was performed in a 25 μl reaction mixture containing 1X PCR buffer (SYBR Green Master Mix; Bio-Rad, United States), 1 μl of each primer (CQULA04R/CQULA04F), and the appropriate amount of DNA template in an RT-PCR system (Step One Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems, United States) as previously reported ( Wang et al., 2006 ). Changes in pathogen titer were recorded from 0 to 5 days based on pathogen copies per gram of citrus leaf, which were calculated with standard curve and CT values. The experiment was repeated three times. 2.4 Citrus endophyte variations in the presence of Bacillus subtilis L1-21 and its mutants An experiment was set as mentioned above to assess the total endophyte variations in citrus leaf in the presence of mutants as compared with WT-L1–21. Firstly, half of the leaves from every treatment were tested for C Las pathogen with qPCR following the protocol in the section 2.3 and the total endophytes were isolated ( Araújo et al., 2002 ). Briefly, the other half of the leaves were treated with 10 6 CFU/mL of mutants and WT-L1–21 while LB broth and water served as control. Samples were processed at 1-day intervals till 5 days. The leaves were first washed thoroughly with sterilized water and then surface sterilized with 70 % ethanol for 30 seconds, followed by rinsing with sterilized water. The last wash was plated on an LB agar plate to validate the efficiency of the sterilization process. The half-leaves from each treatment were weighed and ground in sterilized mortar and pestle under sterile conditions. The homogenate was evenly spread on LB agar plates and incubated at 28 ℃ for 24–48 hours, and total endophytes (CFU/g) were recorded for each treatment at intervals of 1–5 days. The experiment was repeated three times. 2.5 Colonization efficiency of Bacillus subtilis L1-21 and its mutants in citrus leaf and difference in swarming motility in vitro In order to compare the colonization efficiency of several mutants with WT-L1–21, the mutant strains were re-isolated with the antibiotic (kanamycin 30 μg/mL) selection medium while WT-L1–21 colonies were counted based on morphology (pink colonies) ( Munir et al., 2022b ). Briefly, the homogenates acquired from samples processed in Section 2.5 were plated on LB agar plates (1.5 % Bacto agar) and incubated at 37 ℃ for 24 hours. The colony-forming units of each mutant and WT-L1–21 were calculated as CFU/g of the leaf at intervals of 1–5 days. The CFU/g was considered the colonization efficiency for each mutant and was compared to the WT-L1–21. Further, the swarm expansion assay with slight modifications was performed to assess the difference in swarming motility of WT-L1–21 and its derived mutants ( Sanchez et al., 2021 ). Fresh cultures of WT-L1–21, △ sfp- L1–21, △ srfAA -L1–21, and △ pel -L1–21 were grown in LB media to mid-log phase and resuspended in phosphate saline buffer (pH 8) to OD 600 =1.0. In total, 5 μl was inoculated in the center of the plate containing LB media with 0.7 % Bacto agar and the plates were dried open-faced in Laminar flow hood for 10 minutes. The swarm diameters were measured after 6 hours, and each treatment consisted of three replicates containing five plates. 2.6 Bacillus subtilis L1-21 and its surfactin mutant applications in healthy and diseased citrus plants The pathogen control efficiency and regulation of metabolic and genetic pathways in presence of △ srfAA- L1–21 and WT-L1–21 were assessed on C Las-infected citrus plants in the greenhouse. Four groups of treatments: healthy (H-CK) and diseased (D-CK) citrus plants (as control), diseased citrus treated with WT-L1–21 (L1–21-D) and△ srfAA- L1–21 (△ srfAA -D) were sampled to study the metabolic and transcriptomic changes in citrus. Each sample consisted of three biological replicates, and three 2-year-old citrus plants were used for each treatment. The citrus plants were grown in plastic pots (310 × 210 mm; height and width) in greenhouse conditions. The citrus plants were checked for C Las pathogen density using qPCR analysis, prior treatments. Three replicates of six leaves were randomly collected for analysis (metabolome and transcriptome) after seven days of foliar spray application with 10 6 CFU/mL of WT-L1–21 and △ srfAA- L1–21 . C Las pathogen density was also recorded at the end of the experiment from each treatment, and Bacilli were isolated and CFU/g was calculated based on morphological identification with microscope. Sampled leaves were also stored at −80 for data validation. 2.7 Metabolomics variations during endophyte and its mutant treatments The leaves from each treatment were milled separately, and the frozen leaf powder (100 mg) was added to 2 mL tubes containing 1.4 mL of pre-chilled aqueous absolute methanol. Approximately 100 μL (0.1 mg/mL) of lidocaine was added to the solution as an internal standard. The homogenate was incubated at 70°C, then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was transferred into glass vials. The homogenate was filtered following absorption using a 0.22 μm pore size filter (SCAA-104, Shanghai, China). The mixture was then pooled for analysis using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). All samples were mixed to create Quality Control (QC) samples used to assess the experimental reproducibility. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a UPLC (Applied Biosystems 4500 QTRAP). Sample volumes of 5 μL were injected into a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 μm). The system used acidified acetonitrile (0.04 % acetic acid) as mobile phase B and acidified water (0.04 % acetic acid) as mobile phase A. The system operated at 40°C and 0.4 mL/min. The chemicals were separated using the following gradient: Phase A/B ratio of 95:5 at 0 minutes; Phase A/B ratio of 5:95 at 11.0 minutes; Phase A/B ratio of 5:95 at 12.0 minutes; Phase A/B ratio of 95:5 at 12.1 minutes; and Phase A/B ratio of 95:5 at 15.0 minutes. An ESI-triple quadrupole-linear ion trap (QTRAP)–MS was used for the effluent. LIT and triple quadrupole (QQQ) scans were acquired on a triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (QTRAP), specifically the AB Sciex QTRAP4500 System. This system, equipped with an ESI-Turbo Ion-Spray interface, operated in positive ion mode and was controlled by Analyst 1.6.1 software (AB Sciex). The operating conditions were as follows: the maximum collision-activated dissociation (CAD) setting, 550 °C for the ESI source temperature, 5500 V for the ion spray voltage (IS), and 25 psi for the curtain gas (CUR). QQQ scans were acquired as MRM experiments with optimized collision energy (CE) and decluttering potential (DP) for each MRM transition. The m/z range was set between 50 and 1000. The data was processed using Analyst 1.6.1 software and in-house Perl software to remove redundant signals. Metabolite profiles were obtained using total ion chromatograms and extracted ion chromatograms (EICs or XICs). The area of each peak was calculated and aligned based on spectral pattern, and metabolites were identified using internal and public databases like KNApSAcK, MassBank, HMDB, MoTo DB, and METLIN ( Wishart et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013 ). The quantified metabolites were assessed based on the response recorded for lidocaine serving as an internal control, and the results were expressed in relative abundance. 2.8 Gene expression from regulated metabolic pathways through transcriptome To study the regulation at gene level, RNA was extracted from the leaf samples using the HiPure HP plant RNA mini kit (Magon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using Ribo-ZeroTM Magnetic Kit (Epicentre), rRNA was removed to enrich mRNA. A total of 2 μg of mRNA was transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Then, DNA polymerase I, RNase H, dNTPs, and a buffer were used to synthesize the second strand of cDNA. The resultant cDNA fragments were purified using a QiaQuick PCR extraction kit following end-repaired, and a poly(A) tail was added, then ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation products were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeqTM2500 platform by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. Guangzhou, China. High-quality clean reads were acquired by eliminating reads that contained adapters and had more than 50 % low-quality reads (Q-value ≤ 20) bases and reads with more than 10 % of unidentified nucleotides (N). The reference genome was downloaded from the citrus database ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/orange/ ). A reference genome was constructed for mapping reads to ribosome RNA (rRNA) using the Bowtie2 short reads alignment tool ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 ). Next, TopHat2 was used to map each sample's rRNA-removed reads to the reference genome ( Kim et al., 2013 ) (version 2.0.3.12). The enriched unmapped reads were divided into smaller fragments and subsequently matched with the reference genome to identify possible splice sites. TopHat2 in combination with the program Cufflinks ( Trapnell et al., 2012 ) was used to reconstruct the transcripts. In the last assembly step, all recovered fragments were aligned with reference genes and similar fragments were removed. The number of reads mapped for each gene RSEM was calculated by RSEM software ( Li and Dewey, 2011 ). The FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase of Transcript per Million Mapped Reads) technique was used to normalize the amount of gene expression. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the edgeR package ( http://www.r-project.org/ ) within three biological replicates in each treatment. Enrichment analysis of GO functions and KEGG pathways was performed on the genes that were identified as significant DEGs, defined as those with a fold change (FC≥1) and a false discovery rate (FDR) of at least 0.05. To identify significantly enriched GO terms in DEGs compared to the genomic background, hypergeometric distribution was used to map all DEGs to GO terms in the Gene Ontology database ( http://www.geneontology.org/ ). FDR-corrected p-values were computed with a threshold of FDR≤0.05. DEGs related to the regulated metabolic pathways were analyzed to draw correspondence with regulated metabolites. The relative expression of selected regulated genes from citrus was performed to validate the RNA-seq results by qPCR. Three biological replicates were selected independently for each treatment and crushed into powder with liquid nitrogen. The RNA was extracted and transcribed as described above. The qPCR reaction was performed as mentioned for C Las pathogen detection. Each sample was run in the reaction with three technical replicates and negative control for the target gene. The list of primers and control used in the qPCR reactions are listed in Table S2 , while the actin 11 gene was used as an internal control for normalization. The obtained data were statistically analyzed as 2 −∆∆ct data and were presented in fold change values ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ). 2.9 Statistical analysis All the data were subjected to GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 (San Diego, CA, USA) and heatmaps were designed with TBtools software. The statistical differences were compared and calculated through One-way ANOVA. The illustrations were designed using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA). 3 Results 3.1 C Las pathogen variations in the presence of Bacillus subtilis L1-21 and its mutants Endophyte L1–21 has been shown to efficiently reduce the pathogen titer in citrus leaf; however, the exact mechanisms are highly elusive. Therefore, several important genes ( sfp, pel, and srfAA) were knocked out from endophyte L1–21 to evaluate their contribution towards the pathogen control. The results of the novel half-leaf assay showed that each mutant performed differently during the experiment as compared with WT-L1–21. The pathogen copies were higher in citrus leaves treated with all the mutants, which signifies that gene deletion reduced the pathogen control efficiency of endophyte L1–21 ( Fig. 1 A). Although till Day 4, similar pathogen titers were recorded in △ pel- L1–21 and WT-L1–21 treated leaves, but at Day 5, △ pel- L1–21 treated leaves had higher pathogen density as compared to the WT-L1–21 treated leaves ( Fig. 1 B). Citrus leaves treated with WT-L1–21 had lowest pathogen load while LB treated leaves showed highest pathogen copies ( Fig. 1 C). Whereas, both mutants (△ srfAA -L1–21 and △ sfp -L1–21) with surfactin production defect showed reduced control of C Las pathogen compared with WT-L1–21. This highlights that colonization of endophyte L1–21 plays a vital role in pathogen control through niche and nutrient competition. In addition, all the mutants were still able to reduce C Las copies in citrus leaf as compared with LB and water control. However, no significant difference was recorded in pathogen reduction in △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 which shows that elimination of both genes had a similar effect on the pathogen control activity of endophyte L1–21 ( Fig. 1 D) . The results signify that endophyte L1–21 controls the pathogen by performing not only one but multiple mechanisms. 3.2 Bacillus subtilis L1-21 and its mutants differentially regulate endophyte dynamics in citrus The application of endophyte may also regulate other endophytic members in citrus leaves. In order to study the effect of WT-L1–21 and mutants application on the enrichment or decline of citrus endophytes, total endophytes were assessed during the course of the half-leaf assay. Citrus leaves treated with WT-L1–21 harbored the highest number of total endophytes as compared to all the treatments. Interestingly, the total endophytes in△ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 treated citrus leaves, were lower than the other treatments ( Fig. 2 A). In contrast, citrus leaves treated with △ pel- L1–21 had a higher number of total endophytes as compared with △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 but lower than the WT-L1–21 at day 5 ( Fig. 2 B). However, the fluctuations were also recorded among treatments at various time points. For instance, at Day 1, the total number of endophytes were lower in △ pel- L1–21 - treated citrus leaves than in the △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 treated leaves and gradually increased until day 5. The trend was the opposite for both mutant treatments at Day 5 ( Fig. 2 B). While, there was no significant increase recorded for number of total endophytes in water and LB control treatments ( Fig. 2 C). Similarly, no significant difference was recorded for the △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 on total endophytes from citrus leaves ( Fig. 2 D), even though △ sfp- L1–21 was expected to produce a higher negative effect. However, both mutants (△ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21) exhibited similar behaviors highlighting the potential role of surfactin. 3.3 Gene knockouts affect the colonization efficiency of Bacillus subtilis L1-21 in citrus leaf In order to compare the colonization efficiency of mutants with WT-L1–21, the strains were re-isolated from the treated citrus leaves. In this regard, the lowest colonization efficiency was recorded for △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 compared with △ pel- L1–21 and WT-L1–21 ( Fig. 3 A-B). Surfactin-deficient mutants △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 could not colonize as efficiently as WT-L1–21 and unexpectedly both mutants showed similar performance ( Fig. 3 C). Therefore, it can be anticipated that colonization and establishment of endophyte L1–21 in citrus tissue are partly controlled by surfactin production and surfactin is one of the most important lipopetides produced by endophyte L1–21. On the other hand, the re-isolated CFU/g value for△ pel- L1–21 was higher than surfactin-related mutant treatments but lower than WT-L1–21 ( Fig. 3 A) which highlights that pectate lyase enzyme is also involved in the colonization but more drastic effect on colonization efficiency was recorded for △ srfAA- L1–21 and △ sfp- L1–21 . Furthermore, a swarm expansion assay was conducted to assess the effect of gene knockouts on swarming motility. After 6 hours, the swarm zones of WT-L1–21 and△ pel- L1–21 did not exhibit any significant difference ( Fig. 4 A), while the swarm zones of both surfactin deficient mutants△ srfAA- L1–21 and△ sfp- L1–21 were almost three times reduced ( p <0.0001) ( Fig. 4 B). The reduction in swarm expansion in both surfactin-related mutants indicates the involvement of surfactin in swarming motility of endophyte L1–21 but pectate lyase seems to perform no role in the motility. Although the swarm zones of △ srfAA -L1–21 and △ sfp -L1–21 showed no significant difference indicating that surfactin is the key lipopeptide affecting motility and colonization. Therefore, △ srfAA -L1–21 was used for further analysis to dissect the involvement of surfactin in the biocontrol mechanism of endophyte L1–21 against C Las pathogen. 3.4 Bacillus subtilis L1-21 and △ srfAA -L1-21 differentially regulate the metabolic signatures in HLB-infected citrus Differential regulation patterns for several important metabolites were recorded among diseased citrus plants treated with WT-L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21. compared to healthy and diseased plants. The application of WT-L1–21 induced various metabolic pathways which resulted in the higher production of vital metabolites in diseased citrus plant belonging to several classes such as organic acids, hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives, amino acids, isoflavones, flavonols, coumarins, and benzoic acid derivatives ( Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, important secondary metabolites such as shikimic acid, azelaic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, daidzein, chrysoeriol-related compounds, and several others were highly enriched in diseased citrus plants treated with WT-L1–21 as compared with un-treated diseased citrus. In contrast, L-pipecolic acid, 2-picolinic acid, ferulic acid, and a major component of phenylpropanoid pathway: L-phenylalanine were reduced in △ srfAA -L1–21 compared to WT-L1–21 treated diseased plants. All these metabolites are known to be directly involved in pathogen inhibition or as intermediates in the pathway related to disease resistance in plants. These results highlight that a deficiency of surfactin could not elicit metabolic reprogramming in diseased citrus as efficiently as WT-L1–21, which signifies that surfactin might be involved in microbe-plant interactions and defence activation as an elicitor. Although, △ srfAA -L1–21 could not induce many important metabolites, some metabolites such as vanillic acid, quercetin 5-O-malonylhexosyl-hexoside, and genistein were enriched as compared with diseased citrus plant which shows that the gene knockout did not entirely disarmed endophyte L1–21 for its biocontrol efficiency ( Fig. 5 A). Further, two hormones serotonin and melatonin were highly enriched in WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants, which indicates a possible role of these two hormones in metabolic cross-talk among plant beneficial microbes and their hosts. Moreover, other compounds involved in the biosynthesis of a class of hormone: indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were also found to be differentially regulated in all treatments. For instance, in WT-L1–21 treated diseased citrus plants, L-tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and indole-5-carboxylic acid were highly enriched as compared with plants treated △ srfAA -L1–21. However, exceptionally two metabolites such as indole and indole-3-carboxaldehyde were also enriched in △ srfAA -L1–21 ( Fig. 5 B). While most of these metabolites were reduced in un-treated diseased plants as compared with other treatments. The differential regulation of these metabolites shows that surfactin may perform various functions in plant-microbe interactions other than the direct antagonism against pathogen. Moreover, three VOCs namely, limonin, trans-2-hexanal, and dihydrojasmone were abundant in WT-L1–21 treated citrus plants as compared with un-treated diseased plants. At the same time, △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants had high quantity of these VOCs as compared with diseased plants but lower than WT-L1–21 treated diseased plants ( Fig. 5 C). 3.5 Transcriptomic insight from the regulated metabolic pathways in response to Bacillus subtilis L1-21 and △ srfAA -L1-21 Endophyte WT-L1–21 and its mutant strain △ srfAA -L1–21 differentially regulated the transcriptome of diseased citrus plants, thereby important pathways related to the detected metabolites were selected for further analysis ( Fig. 6 ). In total, three comparison groups: HCK vs DCK, DCK vs WT-L1–21, and DCK vs △ srfAA -L1–21 were used to analyze the transcript enrichment patterns in the treatments. Briefly, transcripts encoding key enzymes from shikimic acid pathway: shikimate kinase and shikimate dehydrogenase, and phenylpropanoid pathway: phenyl (PHE) ammonia lyase 1, 4-coumarate: CoA ligase 2, and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase were found to be significantly upregulated in WT-L1–21 treated diseased citrus plants as compared with un-treated diseased plants. These transcripts were found to be downregulated in un-treated diseased plants as compared with healthy plants showing that pathogen might deactivate these pathways to establish the disease. Interestingly, most of the transcripts were also downregulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 as compared to WT-L1–21 treated citrus plants. These results corroborate the differential synthesis of secondary metabolites in all treatments, as discussed in the above section ( Fig. 6 A). Further, the transcript encoding important enzyme flavonol synthase involved in flavonol synthesis was also highly expressed in WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 and un-treated diseased citrus plants. Similarly, two other important enzymes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase and lipoxygenase 2 from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate pathway and lipoxygenase pathway, respectively were also induced in WT-L1–21 treated citrus as compared with other treatments ( Fig. 6 A). The differential regulation of important transcripts and metabolites corroborates with the higher pathogen reduction in citrus plants with the application of WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 where the pathogen titer was higher than the WT-L1–21 treated diseased plants. Further, qRT-PCR was performed to validate the RNA-seq data with six differentially expressed transcripts among all treatments ( Figure S4 ). Moreover, auxin biosynthesis and transport-related transcripts were also differentially regulated among the treatments. We found four transcripts encoding tryptophan synthase, indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase, auxin efflux carrier family protein, and auxin-responsive GH3 family protein to be more upregulated in WT-L1–21 treated plants as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21. In contrast, only one transcript related to indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase was also slightly upregulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 compared with un-treated diseased plant, whereas all transcripts other than auxin-responsive GH3 family protein were downregulated in diseased control plants as compared with healthy plants ( Fig. 6 B). These insights from transcriptome further confirm the variations in the important metabolites detected from un-targeted metabolome analysis at the molecular level. 3.6 Activation of metabolic pathways leads to pathogen reduction and enrichment of Bacilli In order to draw a correlation with the activation of important metabolic pathways, pathogen density was recorded at the start and after seven days of treatments. The pathogen was higher in un-treated diseased plants after seven days, and there was no significant difference recorded. Whereas, treatment of WT-L1–21 significantly reduced the pathogen titer in diseased citrus plants ( p <0.0001) as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants. The mutant showed reduced efficiency for pathogen control as compared with WT-L1–21 ( Fig. 6 C) and the results were similar to those recorded in half-leaf assay. Further, endophytes are known to recruit other members and regulate the microbiome assembly by modulating plant metabolic profiles or hormones. In this regard, Bacilli enrichment was assessed in all the treatments and higher Bacilli were present in WT-L1–21 compared to un-treated and △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants ( Fig. 6 D). The higher enrichment of Bacilli with WT-L1–21 might corresponds to the surfactin QS molecule which regulates community-related behavior in Bacilli or due to the upregulation of plant IAA. 4 Discussion Endophytes are ubiquitous in all plants and considered an integral member of plant microbiomes. They are known for their attributes such as plant growth promotion and protection against various stresses ( Ahmed et al., 2024 ). Although researchers have reported several mechanisms such as direct antagonism, competition, and induction of plant resistance ( Munir et al., 2022a; Singh et al., 2023 ), but the knowledge gaps still exist due to the complexity of the tripartite interactions among host plant-microbe-pathogen. Herein, our study validates the biocontrol efficiency of endophyte L1–21 against citrus HLB disease and role of surfactin in mitigating the deadly pathogen. Surfactin has been reported for various functions such as motility, biofilm formation, and as a signal molecule which are important features for microbial colonization in host plant. In this regard, several mutants related to colonization such as △ sfp -L1–21, △ srfAA -L1–21, and △ pel -L1–21 were assessed to understand whether these genetic elements of endophyte L1–21 are involved in C Las pathogen control in citrus. The C Las pathogen copies were drastically reduced in WT-L1–21 as compared with all the mutants tested. The decline in pathogen reduction efficiency was more prominent in △ srfAA -L1–21 and△ sfp -L1–21 than the △ pel -L1–21 ( Fig. 1 ). Here, it was expected that △ sfp -L1–21 would exhibit drastic decline in performance due to absence of PPTase which is required for the production of active lipopeptides. In contrast, both the mutants (△ srfAA -L1–21 and△ sfp -L1–21) showed similar performance highlighting that surfactin is the key lipopeptides involved in biocontrol activity of endophyte L1–21 ( Fig. 1 D). Similarly, a study reported that mutant of B. subtilis 9407 deficient in surfactin production could not antagonize the bacterial pathogen Acidovorax citrulli both in vitro and in planta . The mutant also showed reduced biofilm formation and colonization in plant host ( Fan et al., 2017 ). Further, total endophytes in citrus plants also varied in all treatments and were recorded highest in WT-L1–21 and lowest in △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21. While △ pel -L1–21 treated citrus plants also had lower number of total endophytes as compared with WT-L1–21 but were higher than in △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 treated citrus plants ( Fig. 2 A). It is noteworthy that surfactin is a small signal molecule which regulates quorum sensing response for biofilm formation and sporulation. A study also reported that surfactin deficient Bacillus cell died due to inability to metabolize carbon sources other than the glucose ( Chen et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it might be possible that surfactin deficiency affected endophytic community due to inefficient regulation of functions related to multicellularity or cooperative behavior in a complex microbial community. It is also reported that surfactins are used as public goods, and Bacilli can use the surfactins produced by other closely related Bacillus species ( Lyons and Kolter, 2017 ). It is likely possible that production of surfactin from WT-L1–21 regulates the colonization patterns and metabolic preferences of other microbes especially Bacilli. However, in △ pel -L1–21 treated plants, endophytes were also lower despite of the presence of sfp and srfAA genes ( Fig. 2 B). There are two possibilities: firstly, degradation products from pectate lyase could involve in Bacilli enrichment as a study reported that pectin molecules stimulated the production of surfactin which regulates mutualistic interactions of Bacilli and its host ( Hoff et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the total endophytes isolated were higher in WT-L1–21 than in △ pel -L1–21. Secondly, absence of pectate lyase encoding gene in △ pel -L1–21 reduced its colonization in citrus, which resulted in reduced total endophytes as Bacilli could be a major fraction of total endophytes. Because pectate lyase enzyme is involved in degrading pectate; a constituent of cell wall which possibly helps endophytic bacteria to penetrate and colonize in plant tissues ( Taghavi et al., 2010 ). To this end, we further re-isolated the applied WT-L1–21 and mutants from citrus leaves. Expectedly, the re-isolated CFU/g of WT-L1–21 was higher than all the mutants ( Fig. 3 ), while being lowest for △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 ( Fig. 3 C) which signifies that these mutants were unable to colonize host efficiently. Whereas, the re-isolated CFU/g of △ pel -L1–21 was lower than WT-L1–21 but it was still higher than other two surfactin deficient mutants highlighting the major role of surfactin in colonization of citrus host and enrichment of other Bacilli for mitigating C Las pathogen. The role of surfactin has been reported for the swarming motility of bacteria, and it is correlated with the colonization in the host plant and the establishment of symbiotic relationships ( Newton et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the swarming motility was tested in in vitro assay and the both surfactin deficient mutants showed reduced swarm zones compared to WT-L1–21 and △ pel -L1–21 ( Fig. 4 ). The reduced swarming in △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 is in agreement with the lower colonization in citrus leaves. Intriguingly, △ sfp -L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 did not show significant difference in terms of pathogen reduction, colonization, and enrichment of endophytes in citrus leave. Although, △ sfp -L1–21 which is deficient of all NRPs (Surfactin, fengycin, and bacillibactin; data not shown), was expected to have reduced efficiency than △ srfAA -L1–21, that is unable to produce surfactin only. Because sfp encodes PPTase: a key enzyme essential for non-ribosomal synthesis of cyclic lipopeptides and synthesis of polyketides. As reported, B. subtilis 168 could not produce surfactin, plipastatin or bacillaene due to the inactive sfp gene and the production was restored by transforming a functional ectopic copy of sfp ( Harwood et al., 2018 ). Here, it can be anticipated that surfactin plays a significant role in biocontrol efficiency of endophyte L1–21. Therefore, we further dissected the underlying mechanisms of L1–21-produced surfactin by comparing the metabolome profiles of WT-L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased citrus plants and the transcripts were also validated for the regulated pathways. Various important metabolites were differentially regulated in WT-L1–21 and △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased plants compared to un-treated diseased citrus plants ( Fig. 5 ). For instance, a higher accumulation of shikimic acid was recorded in WT-L1–21 treated citrus compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 treated and un-treated diseased plants. Shikimic acid is a key metabolite from shikimic acid pathway which forms a bridge between sugar metabolism and synthesis of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) and secondary metabolites ( Shende et al., 2024 ). In relevance, transcripts encoding shikimate dehydrogenase and shikimate kinase 1 were more up-regulated in plants treated with WT-L1–21 (log2-FC= 2.24; log2-FC=3.3) as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 (log2-FC=0.00; log2-FC= 2.77) treated and un-treated diseased plant (log2-FC= −2.18; log2-FC= −6.25) ( Fig. 6 A, Table S3 ). The aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, a final product of shikimic acid pathway, is a key component and precursor of phenylpropanoid pathway was relatively higher in WT-L1–21 as compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 treated and un-treated diseased plants. The higher accumulation of L-phenylalanine highlights the induction of phenylpropanoid pathway which provides a rich source of various secondary metabolites important for plant development and defense. In concordance, two transcripts of PAL gene encoding phenyl ammonia lyase 1 was also highly induced in WT-L1–21 (log2-FC = 14.2, 6.34) as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 (log2-FC = 2.80, 1.45) and diseased plant (log2-FC = −10.26, −7.05). PAL catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamate and directs the carbon flow from shikimic acid pathway to the general phenylpropanoid pathway ( Fig. 7 ). This pathway is well understood for mounting plant disease resistance against invading pathogen. A recent study also reported the upregulation of PAL and other genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway by application of microbial fermentation product in C. sinensis infected with HLB ( Lally et al., 2021 ). Our results highlight the activation of key metabolic pathways in citrus by WT-L1–21 but, interestingly △ srfAA -L1–21 could not induce the selected metabolites and related transcripts to the similar extent as the WT-L1–21. These insights signify the contribution of surfactin produced from endophyte L1–21 in mounting the resistance against C Las pathogen in citrus plants. Similarly, various important secondary metabolites from phenylpropanoid pathway such as cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, and chlorogenic acid were also differentially regulated among all the treatments. These metabolites are known for their antioxidants and antimicrobial properties against pathogenic bacteria. Further, the pathway extends to the synthesis of isoflavonoids and flavonoids, such as several related to quercetin and chrysoeriol-related compounds well-known for antibacterial properties ( Lally et al., 2021 ) were highly accumulated in WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 treated plants and un-treated diseased plants ( Fig. 5 ), which correlates with the accumulation of their precursors as discussed above. A higher concentration of metabolites such as flavonoids, terpenes, and aldehydes have been found in citrus varieties tolerant to HLB ( Lally et al., 2021; Munir et al., 2022a ), highlighting the role of WT-L1–21 in metabolic reprogramming towards resistance. Moreover, the transcripts related to the important enzymes from the pathway, such as: 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate, and flavonol synthase were relatively up-regulated in WT-L1–21 while down-regulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 treated citrus plants. Interestingly, transcripts for two key enzymes: cinnamoyl- CoA reductase 1 and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 6 involved in lignin synthesis were also up-regulated in WT-L1–21 treated plants (log2-FC= 2.64; log2-FC= 7.0), while both transcripts were not regulated in △ srfAA -L1–21 as compared with un-treated diseased plants ( Fig. 6 A) highlighting the role of lignin in C Las control. A study reported that early C Las infection suppresses the formation of lignin and restoration of this pathway may control pathogen spread because plants employ lignification and reinforcement of cell walls as a defense strategy against pathogen ( Bo et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2023 ). Lignin synthesis genes were also upregulated in HLB-tolerant Australian finger lime compared to HLB-susceptible ‘Valencia’ sweet orange ( Weber et al., 2022 ). These findings reveal that WT-L1–21 application in diseased citrus confers resistance through activation of lignin synthesis and surfactin may play a role in host-microbe crosstalk as evident through the failure of △ srfAA -L1–21 in producing similar plant responses. Our results also found several VOCs to be differentially regulated among treatments, such as 2-hexanal produced in the lipoxygenase pathway, which was found to induce a subset of defense-related genes in Arabidopsis ( Bate and Rothstein, 1998; Matsui and Engelberth, 2022 ). The transcript encoding lipoxygenase was also upregulated in WT-L1–21 treated plants than the other treatments which further supports the higher production of volatiles in presence of WT-L1–21 but not in △ srfAA -L1–21 ( Fig. 6 A, Fig. 7 ). The activation of the important pathways correlated with the reduced pathogen density recorded in diseased citrus plants treated with WT-L1–21 compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 and un-treated diseased plants ( Fig. 6 C). Plant hormones are key regulatory elements that control various physiological functions in plants, including defense responses and even microbiome assembly ( Eichmann et al., 2021 ). Interestingly, several metabolites related to IAA, an important auxin, were found to be higher in WT-L1–21 compared to △ srfAA -L1–21 treated diseased citrus plants ( Fig. 5 C). Similarly, transcripts related to auxin synthesis and perception were also differentially regulated in all treatments, supporting the results of metabolomic changes in citrus ( Fig. 6 B). A genome-wide association analysis revealed auxins to be one of the genetic elements linked with microbiome assembly ( Brachi et al., 2022 ), and even in maintaining the Bacillus -biofilms to promote beneficial interactions with host plants ( Ganin et al., 2019 ). The differential regulation of IAA in our study might be linked to the enrichment of endophytes in WT-L1–21 inoculated plants but not in △ srfAA -L1–21 in half-leaf assay. To further prove this, higher enrichment of Bacilli was observed in healthy and WT-L1–21 treated diseased plants, while fewer Bacilli were present in △ srfAA -L1–21 ( Fig. 6 D). The result supports our hypothesis that the introduction of an endophyte may enrich other microbial members by direct communication through quorum sensing, where surfactin also acts as a signaling molecule or indirectly regulates the microbial assembly by modulating the plant metabolome. 5 Conclusions The study provides new molecular insight into the biocontrol mechanism and role of surfactin from endophyte L1–21 against C Las pathogen by comparing three knockout mutants △ srfAA -L1–21, △ sfp -L1–21, and △ pel -L1–21. Two mutants, △ srfAA -L1–21 and△ sfp -L1–21 showed similar patterns in reduced efficiency against C Las pathogen control, endophyte enrichment, and colonization in citrus leaf. Contrarily, △ pel -L1–21 did not exhibit reduced efficiency as other mutants, highlighting the key role of surfactin. Surfactin has been known for its involvement in biofilm formation, colonization, and as a signaling molecule, but it may also govern complex interactions among introduced endophytes, host plants, and other microbial members. In relevance, our results document the higher accumulation of several key metabolites and their related transcripts in WT-L1–21 as compared with △ srfAA -L1–21 treated plants, which highlights that endophyte L1–21 employs surfactin as its biocontrol toolkit to mitigate C Las in citrus ( Fig. 8 ). Based on our findings, surfactin serves several key roles: firstly, it is crucial for the establishment of endophyte L1–21 in citrus tissue. Secondly, it may act as a signaling molecule that promotes the enrichment of other Bacilli, as evidenced by the higher culturable endophyte number in WT-L1–21. Thirdly, surfactin acts as an elicitor, activating various key metabolic pathways that mount resistance against C Las.
