    "full_text": "Peelability is an important fruit quality trait of citrus. Pectinase is a group of heterozygous enzymes that function in pectin degradation, which is implicated in fruit ripening and softening. Previously we established a method to quantify citrus peelability through two mechanical indexes (peel-pulp adherence and peel resistance of penetration), and exhibited the genetic diversity of peelability in mandarins ( Citrus reticulata Blanco). With this method, the present study first confirmed that Clementine is an easy-peeling mandarin in comparison with Fremont, and both showed increasingly easy peeling as the fruits matured. A range of measurements for the two mandarins at three maturation stages demonstrated that peelability had negative correlation with pectin contents but positive with pectinase activity. Subsequently, RNA sequencing was performed for comparative transcriptomic profiling of the two varieties at three maturation stages. We identified 12322 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in total. Through comparative time-course analysis, the gene expression patterns were displayed with 12 clusters each in albedo and flavedo. Some cell wall-related gene ontology terms were over-represented in albedo and flavedo Cluster6. We mined 153 genes encoding pectinase (pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase, pectin lyase (PL), beta-galactanase, pectin acetylesterase and alpha-arabinofuranosidase) in silica from Clementine genome, and 78 of them were significantly expressed in the peel of Clementine or Fremont, whereas 62/60 belonged to the DEGs in albedo/flavedo. In weighted correlation network analysis, six/five out of eight/nine modules in albedo/flavedo had eigengene values that were significantly correlated with the two mechanical indexes, pectin contents and pectinase activity, and six/eight pectinase genes were present in the co-expression networks. Based on the results of multi-approach bioinformatics analysis, three PL genes ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) were highlighted as potential regulators for peelability. This study provides clues for understanding the molecular basis of the regulation of citrus peelability, and proposes pectinase as a target for peelability-oriented breeding of citrus."

          "Citrus is the largest fruit crop in the world. Among various types, mandarin is the second largest citrus after sweet orange, but it is growing faster than sweet orange, as the production and acreage of mandarin have increased by 29.3 % and 23.9 % from 2016 to 2021, whereas those of sweet orange only by 4.30 % and -0.82 %, respectively (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL). Different from sweet orange, pummelo ( C. maxima (Burm). Merr.) and grapefruit ( C. paradise Macfad.), mandarin is an easy-peeling citrus type and hence favoured by consumers owing to the convenience for direct eating ( Simons et al., 2018 ). The booming mandarin production is attributable to, at least partially, the ease of peeling. Therefore, peelability has been recognised as an important fruit quality trait of citrus ( Goldenberg et al., 2018 ; Yu et al., 2021 ).",
          "Subjectively judged by laboratory personnel and classified into several rates such as easy, medium and hard peeling, citrus peelability is conventionally a semi-quantitative trait. With this approach, Goldenberg et al. (2014) rated the peelability of 46 mandarin varieties in Israeli Citrus breeding collection; and Minamikawa et al. (2017) estimated the peelability for 787 citrus genotypes in a genome-wide association study. Previously we quantified peelability with two mechanical indexes (peel-pulp adherence and peel resistance of penetration) by using an apparatus based on a force gauge ( Yu et al., 2021 ). Thereafter the genetic diversity of peelability for 80 mandarins in National Citrus Germplasm Repository (Chongqing, China) were shown. These mandarins were categorised into 8 hard-peeling and 72 easy-peeling mandarins that could be further divided into 42 very easy-peeling and 30 moderately easy-peeling mandarins ( Yu et al., 2021 ). Most of the hard-peeling and moderately easy-peeling mandarins are the hybrids of sweet orange or pummelo, implying that the lineage admixture between species confers the harder peeling of modern mandarin hybrids.",
          "The physiological and molecular basis of citrus peelability is still absent; and owing to the distinct anatomical structure of citrus fruits, few lessons can be directly learned from model fruits such as tomato and strawberry. It is assumed that the regulation of citrus peelability is analogous to fruit firmness, because one mechanical index, peel resistance of penetration, which is correlated with the other index peel-pulp adherence ( Yu et al., 2021 ), can also indicates peel or fruit firmness. Fruit softening is a hallmark of ripening. The regulatory mechanism of cell wall disassembling during fruit ripening and softening are being drawn great attention in tomato and strawberry ( Li et al., 2021 ; Shi et al., 2023 ; Wang and Seymour, 2022 ). For citrus, fruit firmness is usually used as an index for evaluating maturity ( Hernandez Gomez et al., 2006 ; Olmo et al., 2000 ) and storability at postharvest ( Badiche-El Hilali et al., 2023 ; Chen et al., 2023 ; Shi et al., 2019 ), but so far it is still undervalued and not well elucidated at physiological and molecular level. In a sporadic study specialising in citrus firmness, Muramatsu and coworkers (1999) reported that the peel firmness of Satsuma mandarin ( C. unshiu Marcow.) and hassaku ( C. hassaku Hort. ex Tanaka) was declining accompanied by the decrease in cell wall polysaccharide contents during fruit development.",
          "Pectin is a family of covalently linked galacturonic acid-rich polysaccharides, and the water-insoluble pectin is also called protopectin, which can be converted into soluble pectin upon hydrolysis ( Sakai et al., 1993 ). Pectin is a major polysaccharide in primary cell wall, where pectin together with hemicellulose coats and interlocks cellulose microfibrils, i.e. , the well-known load-bearing network model ( Lampugnani et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2018a ). It is also abundant in middle lamellae between primary cell walls, where it mediates intercellular adhesion ( Daher and Braybrook, 2015 ; Zamil and Geitmann, 2017 ). According to the structure and glycosidic components, pectin can be classified into homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) ( Mohnen, 2008 ). Being a gel-like matrix, pectin influences cell expansion, adhesion and porosity, and functions in various biological events, for example growth ( Wolf and Greiner, 2012 ), development ( Saffer, 2018 ), morphogenesis ( Palin and Geitmann, 2012 ; Saffer, 2018 ), plant-microbe interaction ( Lionetti et al., 2012 ; Prade et al., 1999 ) and fruit ripening and softening ( Wang et al., 2018a ).",
          "Pectin degradation is catalysed by a group of heterozygous enzymes called pectinase ( Kashyap et al., 2001 ). Pectin methylesterase (PME, EC 3.1.1.11), pectin acetylesterase (PAE, EC 3.1.1.6), polygalacturonase (PG, EC 3.2.1.15), pectate lyase (PL, EC 4.2.2.2), beta-galactanase (BGAL, EC 3.2.1.23) and alpha-arabinofuranosidase (AF, EC 3.2.1.55) are all pectinases. PME and PAE catalyse the hydrolysis of methyl esters (C6) and acetyl esters (C2 or C3) of HG backbone, respectively, and consequently remodel the HG conformation for the subsequent degradation catalyzed by PG and PL, which cleave alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds of HG through hydrolysis and beta-elimination, respectively. In RG-I side-chains, BGAL and AF hydrolyse terminal beta-1, 4 glycosidic bonds between galactan and the terminal arabinofuranosidic bonds between arabinans, respectively. As the substrates (galactans or arabinans) are the components of hemicellulose as well, BGAL and AF can also degrade hemicellulose. Based on plentiful genetic and molecular evidence, the notion that pectinase mediates fruit softening during ripening has been well established ( Prasanna et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2018a ).",
          "Pectin is abundant in citrus peel (25 – 35 % of total dry substance) ( Ciriminna et al., 2015 ). A number of studies have reported that pectin is involved in the regulation of pulp mastication ( Lei et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2023 ), crispness ( Wang et al., 2018b ) and fruit maturation ( Mi et al., 2022 ; Pan et al., 2021 ) in citrus. However, the role of pectin/pectinase in the regulation of citrus peelability is still inconclusive. This study aims to reveal the precise relation between peelability and pectin/pectinase during fruit maturation, and provide clues for understanding the molecular basis of peelability regulation. With two mandarins (Clementine and Fremont) during fruit maturation as materials and a range of mechanical and physiological measurements, we demonstrated a close relation between peelability and pectin/pectinase. Subsequently, we conducted comparative transcriptomic analysis for the two mandarins peel at three maturation stages. In addition, we mined genome-wide pectinase genes significantly expressed in citrus peel. Three PL genes ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) are highlighted as important regulators of citrus peelability based on the results of multi-approach bioinformatics analysis."

These measurements were fundamentally based on sulfuric acid-carbazole colourimetry method.

Two-way ANOVA showed that both fruit maturation and variety had significant effects ( P < 0.0001) on peel-pulp adherence, peel resistance of penetration, the contents of protopectin, water-soluble and CDTA-soluble pectin and pectinase activity ( Table 1 ). In addition, the maturation-variety interaction also showed highly significant effects ( P < 0.0001) on the two mechanical indexes and moderately significant effects ( P < 0.05) on protopectin content and pectinase activity in both tissues and water and CDTA-soluble pectin contents in albedo ( Table 1 ). At Stage 1/2/3, the peel-pulp adherence and peel resistance to penetration of Fremont was 2.25/2.49/1.93 and 2.29/3.54/1.81 times as those of Clementine, respectively, suggesting Fremont was a hard-peeling mandarin in comparison with Clementine. The two indexes underwent dramatic decline (86.2 % and 65.6 % in Clementine and 78.7 % and 61.9 % in Fremont) from Stage 1 to 2, and decreased mildly or remained unchanged from Stage 2 to Stage 3 ( Fig. 1B , C), indicating peelability increased as fruits matured, especially before colour break. Throughout the maturation, the contents of protopectin, water-soluble and CDTA-soluble pectin were steadily declining in the flavedo of both mandarins ( Fig. 1D-F ), and the pectinase activity was increasing ( Fig. 1G ). The hard-peeling Fremont had overall higher contents of pectin and lower pectinase activity at the same maturation stage ( Fig. 1D-G ).",

The averaged TPM of the 36 libraries ranged from 0.11 ( Ciclev10023990m.g ) to 13999.9 ( Ciclev10029803m.g ) with mean of 50.3 and median of 16.9.",

An exception was Fremont albedo at Stage 3 (Fre_Al_3_b), which was outside the Fre_Al_3 clade but constituted a larger clade with Fre_Al_3_a, Fre_Al_3_c and three libraries of Clementine albedo at Stage 2 (Cle_Al_2_a, b, c). Nevertheless, Fre_Al_3_b was more highly correlated with Fre_Al_3_a and Fre_Al_3 ( r = 0.90 and 0.92) than Cle_Al_2_a, b and c ( r = 0.86, 0.86 and 0.83). Although the three libraries of Fremont at Stage 3 were slightly scattered at PC1, the PCA plot shown by two principal components (74 % and 12 % of total variance) could clearly distinguish different varieties, tissues and fruit developmental stages (Fig. S1B). Taken together, our RNA sequencing results were reproducible and suitable for further analysis.",

The numbers of DEGs between the two mandarins were decreasing as the fruits matured. Clementine had 4049/2894 and 2398/3297 DEGs of Stage 1 vs. Stage 2 and Stage 2 vs. Stage 3 in albedo/flavedo, and Fremont had 3020/2783 and 2060/3364. Obviously, Clementine had more DEGs than Fremont with an exception of Stage 2 vs. Stage 3 in flavedo.",

Venn analysis identified 61/84 and 66/108 DEGs related to easy/hard peeling in albedo and flavedo ( Fig. 3 , Supplementary Table 2). These easy/hard peeling-related DEGs were annotated with 399/484 GO terms (133/126 biological processes (BPs), 93/120 cellular components (CCs) and 173/238 molecular functions (MFs)), suggesting they were involved in diverse biological activities. Several genes encoding pectinase were implicated in the easy/hard peeling-related DEGs. Ciclev10005117m.g encoding a PAE in albedo and Ciclev10031429m.g encoding a PL in flavedo are easy peeling-relate DEGs, and Ciclev10007940m.g encoding a type I PME in flavedo as hard peeling-related DEG. Besides, Ciclev10002233m.g and Ciclev10032524m.g encoding expansin, which function in mediating cell wall loosening, belonged to the easy peeling-relate DEGs in both tissues.

Notably, three PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) were up-regulated by 5.7 – 8.0 times in albedo and 4.4 – 48.0 times in flavedo from Stage 2 to Stage 1, and subsequently decreased at Stage 3 ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table 2). They were top 1.42%, 0.33% and 1.22% high-expressed genes. The mean TPM of Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g in the all libraries were 398.9, 884.7 and 428.8 (Supplementary Table 2), which were 8.4, 19.9 and 9.2 times higher than the average value of the all genes."

              "To display the gene expression profiles of Clementine and Fremont during the fruit maturation, we performed a time-course analysis. Different gene expression patterns ( FDR < 0.05, r 2 > 0.6) were exhibited with 12 clusters ( Fig. 5A and B, Supplementary Table 2), where 13193 and 12483 genes in albedo and flavedo were implicated. The genes in different clusters varied in amount, ranged from 343 (flavedo Cluster12) to 2308 (flavedo Cluster2). Cluster5, 6 and 8 of albedo and Cluster1, 4 and 6 of flavedo represented the gene sets that had higher expression level in easy-peeling Clementine than hard-peeling Fremont at least at one maturation stage. There were 6 (3 PMEs, 5 PGs, 3 PLs, 3 BGALs, 1 PAE and 1 AF) and 26 (5 PMEs, 7 PGs, 4 PLs, 6 BGALs, 3 PAE and 1 AF) pectinase genes in these clusters (Supplementary Table 3). The above-mentioned PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) belonged to albedo Cluster8 and flavedo Cluster1. Although the genes in albedo Cluster10 and flavedo Cluster8 also showed higher expression levels in Clementine, they probably reflected the inherent difference other than peelability because of the nearly unchanged expression level during the fruit maturation. It is reasonably that very few pectinase gene (only one PME) was present in these two clusters.",

          "Unlike conventional fruit quality traits such as size, sugar and acid contents, colour, taste and flavor, peelability is unique in citrus but often undervalued. Nevertheless, peelability becomes increasingly important in recent years ( Goldenberg et al., 2018 ; Yu et al., 2021 ), because it directly influences the commercial values as consumers favour the easy-peeling citrus than the hard-peeling one ( Simons et al., 2018 ). The physiological and molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying citrus peelability should be paid more attention. The transcriptomic data presented in this study provide clues for understanding the molecular basis of the formation and regulation of citrus peelability.",
          "Softening is a hallmark of ripening for most fleshy fruits. Citrus firmness is often used as an index for evaluating maturity ( Hernandez Gomez et al., 2006 ; Olmo et al., 2000 ) and storability at postharvest ( Badiche-El Hilali et al., 2023 ; Chen et al., 2023 ; Shi et al., 2019 ). In this study, as a dual indicator of fruit firmness and peelability, peel resistance of penetration remarkably dropped from Stage 1 to Stage 2 followed by marginal decline from Stage 2 to Stage 3 ( Fig. 1C ), suggesting that citrus softening predominantly occurs before colour break. This observation is distinct from climacteric tomato ( Nie et al., 2022 ; Uluisik et al., 2016 ) and non-climacteric strawberry ( Lin et al., 2023 ), both of which undergo significant softening after colour break. It appears that the different softening pattern is unrelated to fruit respiratory climacteric, and citrus probably has a distinct pre-harvest softening pattern and regulatory mechanism from tomato ( Wang and Seymour, 2022 ) and strawberry (Alejandra Moya-Leon et al., 2019 ; Shi et al., 2023 ). In addition, citrus fruits usually satisfy commercial requirement and are often picked before fully ripening, so the softening is incomparable to that of other fleshy fruits.",
          "Muramatsu et al (1999) has reported concomitant decrease in cell wall polysaccharide contents and peel firmness in Satsuma mandarin and hassaku during fruit development. The degradation of cell wall polysaccharides in fruit softening is well recognised and elucidated ( Peng et al., 2022 ; Vicente et al., 2007 ). Based on the chemical structure, cell wall polysaccharides are classified into cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin in plants, and this study highlighted pectin. In this study, the contents of different pectins decreased accompanied by the increase in peelability during fruit maturation ( Fig. 1B–E , Fig. 2 ). Moreover, a pectin-related GO term (GO:0030570, pectate lyase activity, MF) was over-presented in Module red in both albedo and flavedo (Supplementary Table 6), whose eigengene values were negatively correlated with the two mechanical indexes ( Fig. 6 ). These results point to a negative regulation of peelability by pectin. The physiological basis of citrus peelability regulated by pectin likely parallel to that of fruit softening. During fruit ripening and softening, pectin drives cellular separation by reducing turgor and cellular adhesion at middle lamella and tricellular junctions through disaggregation, de-esterification, depolymerisation and solubilisation ( Uluisik et al., 2016 ; Vicente et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2018a ). Interestingly, together with cell wall-related GO terms, some hemicellulose-related terms, such as GO:0006073 (cellular glucan metabolic process, BP), GO:0010411 (xyloglucan metabolic process, BP) and GO:0016762 (xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase activity, MF) were over-presented in albedo and flavedo Cluster6 and peelability-correlated modules ( Fig. 5C , Supplementary Table 4 and 6). Thus, hemicellulose is probably also involved in the regulation of citrus peelability, and should not be ignored for the future research in citrus peelability.",
          "Pectin degradation is catalysed via pectinases during fruit ripening and softening ( Wang et al., 2018a ). In this study, pectinase activity increased accompanied by the decreases in mechanical indexes and increases in pectin contents during fruit maturation, and that of the easy-peeling Clementine were overall higher than the hard-peeling Fremont ( Fig. 1B–G ). The pectinase activity negatively correlated with pectin contents and the mechanical indexes ( Fig. 2 ). Based on these observations, pectinase is plausibly a key factor influencing pectin contents and therefore citrus peelability. However, pectinase is not a single but cocktail enzyme. PME, PG, PL, BGAL, PAE and AF, notwithstanding diverse biochemical activity in planta , are all involved in pectin degradation and called pectinases collectively ( Kashyap et al., 2001 ). The predominant pectinase individuals that responsible for fruit softening is likely species-dependent. For instance, PL is more important than PG in the softening of tomato ( Uluisik et al., 2016 ), whereas reverse is true for strawberry ( Posé et al., 2015 ); and BGAL is seemingly crucial for apple ( Gwanpua et al., 2014 ; Yang et al., 2018 ). Although the precise relation between different pectinase individuals and peelability remains further investigation, it should be considered as a target for peelability-oriented citrus breeding.",
          "Genome-wide identification of the genes encoding pectinase in citrus is crucial for identifying key players in peelability regulation. This study mined totally 153 genes encoding various pectinases (PME, PG, PL, BGAL, PAE and AF) in silica from Clementine genome, 78 of which were significantly expressed in mandarin peel and 68 of which belonged to DEGs ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table 3). These data not only pave the way for understanding the regulation of peelability at molecular genetic level, but also benefit the study of other pectin-related physiological and developmental events of citrus.",
          "The physiological action of PL in fruit (date, pear, rowan and apple) softening has been substantiated with a range of biochemical experiments in vitro and in viv o (Al Hinai et al., 2021 ). Herein we propose that three PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) act as regulators for citrus peelability based on the following observations. (1) They had surprisingly high transcriptional level (top 1.42%, 0.33% and 1.22% high-expressed genes) in peel (Supplementary Table 2), which was confirmed qRT-PCR ( Fig. 8 ). (2) They were remarkably up-regulated in the comparisons of hard peeling (Stage 1 or Fremont) with easy peeling (Stage 2 or Clementine) ( Fig. 4 ). (3) They fell into Module red in flavedo and albedo of the WGCNA, whose eigengene values had negative correlation of peelability indexes with pectin contents ( Fig. 6 ). In other fleshy fruits, some PL homologous genes sharing 60-80% sequence identity with them, such as tomato SlPL ( Uluisik et al., 2016 ; Yang et al., 2017 ) and SlPL16 ( Ren et al., 2023 ), strawberry PLc ( Jiménez-Bermúdez et al., 2002 ; Santiago-Domenech et al., 2008 ), peach PpePL1 and PpePL15 ( Xu et al., 2022 ) grape VvPL15 ( Ma et al., 2023 ), have been demonstrated to play a critical role in fruit ripening and softening through various genetic manipulations and physiological investigation.",
          "TFs are master regulators of gene expression at transcriptional level. The enrichment of GO:0003700 (transcription factor activity, MF) in Module turquoise in albedo and flavedo (Supplementary Table 6) implies that the transcription regulation of citrus peelability is non-negligible. Our study identified 742 DE TF genes in peel (Supplementary Table 5), and some of them are plausibly implicated in peelability regulation. For example, Ciclev10024061m.g encoding a WRKY TF, was easy peeling-related in albedo in the Venn analysis (Supplementary Table 5, Fig. 3 ). It has been reported that banana MaWRKY49 ( Liu et al., 2023 ) and strawberry FvWRKY48 ( Zhang et al., 2022 ) promote fruit softening through activating MaPL11 and MaPL3 or FvPLa . Another TF family potentially functions in citrus peelability regulation probably is bHLH protein. We observed one bHLH gene ( Ciclev10031873m.g ), a top 10 high-expressed TF, was easy peeling-related in both albedo and flavedo according to the Venn analysis (Supplementary Table 5, Fig. 3 ), and another bHLH gene ( Ciclev10013209m.g ) was co-expressed with the three important PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) in the WGCNA co-expression networks ( Fig. 7 ). Indeed, in Arabidopsis , two bHLH transcription factors called ALC and IND trigger silique dehiscence ( Rajani and Sundaresan, 2001 ). It is well acknowledged that bHLH TF promote fruit development and ripening in tomato ( Waseem et al., 2019 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ), passionfruit ( Passiflora edulis Sim) ( Liang et al., 2023 ; Xu et al., 2023 ), banana ( Wang et al., 2020 ), peach ( Zhang et al., 2018 ), Chinese jujube ( Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) ( Li et al., 2019 ) and melon ( Tan et al., 2021 ). The transcriptional regulation of citrus peelability through pectinase should be a significant topic in plant biology."

WGCNA identified eight/nine modules in albedo/flavedo, and six/five of them had eigengene values that correlated with the two mechanical indexes, pectin contents and pectinase activity. Six/eight pectinase genes were involved in the co-expression undirected networks of albedo/flavedo.

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Citrus is the largest fruit crop in the world. Among various types, mandarin is the second largest citrus after sweet orange, but it is growing faster than sweet orange, as the production and acreage of mandarin have increased by 29.3 % and 23.9 % from 2016 to 2021, whereas those of sweet orange only by 4.30 % and -0.82 %, respectively (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL). Different from sweet orange, pummelo ( C. maxima (Burm). Merr.) and grapefruit ( C. paradise Macfad.), mandarin is an easy-peeling citrus type and hence favoured by consumers owing to the convenience for direct eating ( Simons et al., 2018 ). The booming mandarin production is attributable to, at least partially, the ease of peeling. Therefore, peelability has been recognised as an important fruit quality trait of citrus ( Goldenberg et al., 2018 ; Yu et al., 2021 ). Subjectively judged by laboratory personnel and classified into several rates such as easy, medium and hard peeling, citrus peelability is conventionally a semi-quantitative trait. With this approach, Goldenberg et al. (2014) rated the peelability of 46 mandarin varieties in Israeli Citrus breeding collection; and Minamikawa et al. (2017) estimated the peelability for 787 citrus genotypes in a genome-wide association study. Previously we quantified peelability with two mechanical indexes (peel-pulp adherence and peel resistance of penetration) by using an apparatus based on a force gauge ( Yu et al., 2021 ). Thereafter the genetic diversity of peelability for 80 mandarins in National Citrus Germplasm Repository (Chongqing, China) were shown. These mandarins were categorised into 8 hard-peeling and 72 easy-peeling mandarins that could be further divided into 42 very easy-peeling and 30 moderately easy-peeling mandarins ( Yu et al., 2021 ). Most of the hard-peeling and moderately easy-peeling mandarins are the hybrids of sweet orange or pummelo, implying that the lineage admixture between species confers the harder peeling of modern mandarin hybrids. The physiological and molecular basis of citrus peelability is still absent; and owing to the distinct anatomical structure of citrus fruits, few lessons can be directly learned from model fruits such as tomato and strawberry. It is assumed that the regulation of citrus peelability is analogous to fruit firmness, because one mechanical index, peel resistance of penetration, which is correlated with the other index peel-pulp adherence ( Yu et al., 2021 ), can also indicates peel or fruit firmness. Fruit softening is a hallmark of ripening. The regulatory mechanism of cell wall disassembling during fruit ripening and softening are being drawn great attention in tomato and strawberry ( Li et al., 2021 ; Shi et al., 2023 ; Wang and Seymour, 2022 ). For citrus, fruit firmness is usually used as an index for evaluating maturity ( Hernandez Gomez et al., 2006 ; Olmo et al., 2000 ) and storability at postharvest ( Badiche-El Hilali et al., 2023 ; Chen et al., 2023 ; Shi et al., 2019 ), but so far it is still undervalued and not well elucidated at physiological and molecular level. In a sporadic study specialising in citrus firmness, Muramatsu and coworkers (1999) reported that the peel firmness of Satsuma mandarin ( C. unshiu Marcow.) and hassaku ( C. hassaku Hort. ex Tanaka) was declining accompanied by the decrease in cell wall polysaccharide contents during fruit development. Pectin is a family of covalently linked galacturonic acid-rich polysaccharides, and the water-insoluble pectin is also called protopectin, which can be converted into soluble pectin upon hydrolysis ( Sakai et al., 1993 ). Pectin is a major polysaccharide in primary cell wall, where pectin together with hemicellulose coats and interlocks cellulose microfibrils, i.e. , the well-known load-bearing network model ( Lampugnani et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2018a ). It is also abundant in middle lamellae between primary cell walls, where it mediates intercellular adhesion ( Daher and Braybrook, 2015 ; Zamil and Geitmann, 2017 ). According to the structure and glycosidic components, pectin can be classified into homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) ( Mohnen, 2008 ). Being a gel-like matrix, pectin influences cell expansion, adhesion and porosity, and functions in various biological events, for example growth ( Wolf and Greiner, 2012 ), development ( Saffer, 2018 ), morphogenesis ( Palin and Geitmann, 2012 ; Saffer, 2018 ), plant-microbe interaction ( Lionetti et al., 2012 ; Prade et al., 1999 ) and fruit ripening and softening ( Wang et al., 2018a ). Pectin degradation is catalysed by a group of heterozygous enzymes called pectinase ( Kashyap et al., 2001 ). Pectin methylesterase (PME, EC 3.1.1.11), pectin acetylesterase (PAE, EC 3.1.1.6), polygalacturonase (PG, EC 3.2.1.15), pectate lyase (PL, EC 4.2.2.2), beta-galactanase (BGAL, EC 3.2.1.23) and alpha-arabinofuranosidase (AF, EC 3.2.1.55) are all pectinases. PME and PAE catalyse the hydrolysis of methyl esters (C6) and acetyl esters (C2 or C3) of HG backbone, respectively, and consequently remodel the HG conformation for the subsequent degradation catalyzed by PG and PL, which cleave alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds of HG through hydrolysis and beta-elimination, respectively. In RG-I side-chains, BGAL and AF hydrolyse terminal beta-1, 4 glycosidic bonds between galactan and the terminal arabinofuranosidic bonds between arabinans, respectively. As the substrates (galactans or arabinans) are the components of hemicellulose as well, BGAL and AF can also degrade hemicellulose. Based on plentiful genetic and molecular evidence, the notion that pectinase mediates fruit softening during ripening has been well established ( Prasanna et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2018a ). Pectin is abundant in citrus peel (25 – 35 % of total dry substance) ( Ciriminna et al., 2015 ). A number of studies have reported that pectin is involved in the regulation of pulp mastication ( Lei et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2023 ), crispness ( Wang et al., 2018b ) and fruit maturation ( Mi et al., 2022 ; Pan et al., 2021 ) in citrus. However, the role of pectin/pectinase in the regulation of citrus peelability is still inconclusive. This study aims to reveal the precise relation between peelability and pectin/pectinase during fruit maturation, and provide clues for understanding the molecular basis of peelability regulation. With two mandarins (Clementine and Fremont) during fruit maturation as materials and a range of mechanical and physiological measurements, we demonstrated a close relation between peelability and pectin/pectinase. Subsequently, we conducted comparative transcriptomic analysis for the two mandarins peel at three maturation stages. In addition, we mined genome-wide pectinase genes significantly expressed in citrus peel. Three PL genes ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) are highlighted as important regulators of citrus peelability based on the results of multi-approach bioinformatics analysis. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Two mandarin varieties (Clementine and Fremont) with similar maturation period but distinct peelability were used as materials in this study. The outer-canopy, healthy and medium-sized fruits in National Citrus Germplasm Repository (Chongqing, China) were sampled at 141 (Stage 1), 176 (Stage 2) and 211 (Stage 3) days after petal fall. After the fruits were placed indoors for ∼6 hours at room temperature, the albedo and flavedo were separately sampled and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at −80 °C. 2.2 Measurements of peelability, pectin content and pectinase activity Citrus peelability were quantified through two mechanical indexes, i.e. , peel-pulp adherence and peel resistance of penetration, which were measured with a home-made apparatus based on a digital force gauge ( Yu et al., 2021 ). The average values of the four peel segments from different directions were considered as the mechanical indexes of the fruit. Ten biological replicates for each samples were set. Commercial kits (Comin, Suzhou, China) were used for pectin measurements, including catalog number YGJ-2-G for protopectin, WSP-2-Y for water soluble pectin and ISP-2-Y for 1, 2-cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA, an effective chelator) soluble pectin. These measurements were fundamentally based on sulfuric acid-carbazole colourimetry method. Pectinase activity was measured with a kit (catalog number PE-2-G, Comin, Suzhou, China) based on 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid assay. Three biological replicates were set. Two-way ANNOVA and Duncan multiple range test were applied by using R package “agricolae”. Pearson correlation matrix were built with R package “corrplot”. 2.3 RNA extraction, library preparation and RNA sequencing Total RNA was extracted from ∼0.1 g albedo or falvedo by using EASYspin (catalog number RN09, Aidlab, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The remaining genomic DNA was removed by using DNAase I (ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA). The RNA quality was determined by 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent, USA) and quantified using the ND-2000 (NanoDrop Technologies, USA). Only the high-quality RNA sample (≥ 1 μg, OD260/280 = 1.8 – 2.2, OD260/230 ≥ 2.0, RIN ≥ 6.5, 28S : 18S ≥ 1.0) was used to construct sequencing library with TruSeqTM RNA sample preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) following the manufacturer's manual. Totally 36 libraries (2 varieties (Clemenine and Fremont), 3 developmental stage, 2 tissues (albedo and flavedo) in 3 replicates) were prepared. Paired-end sequencing was conducted with NovaSeq 6000 platforms (Illumina, San Diego, USA) in Majorbio (Shanghai, China). The raw sequencing data were deposited in Sequence Read Archive database of NCBI (accession number PRJNA1053645). 2.4 Bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome The raw reads of RNA sequencing were trimmed and controlled with SeqPrep (https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep) and Sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle) with default parameters. The resulting clean reads were aligned to Citrus clementina v1.0 (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Cclementina_v1_0) with orientation mode using HISAT2 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml), and subsequently assembled by StringTie (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie) in a reference-based approach. The relative expression level of each transcript was normalised with transcripts per million reads (TPM) by using RSEM (http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem). Only those genes that had > 1 TPM in at least two libraries were considered as the genes significantly expressed in peels and used for further analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by using DESeq ( Anders and Huber, 2010 ) with |log2FoldChange| > 1 and P < 0.05. Venn diagram was illustrated with R package “ggVennDiagram”. Over representation analysis (ORA) of gene ontology (GO) functional annotation was performed with R package “clusterProfiler” (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html). R package “maSigPro” (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maSigPro.html) was employed for multiple series time course analysis, where the regression fit were cut off by Benjamini and Hochberg FDR < 0.05; the significant genes were cut off by r 2 > 0.6 and P > 0.05 in the best regression model with “two.ways.backward” method. The unsigned network of weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed by using R package “WGCNA” ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 ) with soft power = 6 that is recommended by the manual of the program, and the resulting co-expressed network was illustrated with Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/). PlantTFDB (http://planttfdb.gao-lab.org/) ( Jin et al., 2017 ) was employed for the genome-wide mining of transcription factors. 2.5 Genome-wide identification of pectinase genes The identification of genes encoding pectinase (PME, PG, PL, BGAL, PAE, and AF) followed two steps: (1) candidate genes were screened out with the gene annotations from RefSeq non-redundant proteins (nr), GO, KEGG orthology (KO), pfam and Swissprot databases, which were retrieved from Citrus clementina v1.0 (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Cclementina_v1_0). (2) The resulting candidates were scanned with Interpro (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/), and only the genes containing the marker motifs ( P < 0.00001) were considered as the pectinase genes. The marker motifs of PME, PG, PL, BGAL, PAE, and AF were PF01095, PF12708, PF00544, PF01301, PF03283 and PF06964, respectively. 2.6 Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) First strand cDNA was synthesised from 0.5 μg of total RNA by using TRUEscript H Minus M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Aidlab, Beijing, China) with oligo (dT). qPCR was performed on the CFX96TM Real-Time system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) using Master qPCR Mix (SYBR Green I) (Tsingke, Beijing, China). All the performance followed the manufacturers’ introductions. Two-ΔΔCT method was used to normalise the RNA level relative to an internal reference gene. Ciclev10025866m.g encoding an actin was selected as an internal standard. All qRT-PCRs were carried out in triplicate. The primers used in this study were listed in Table S1. 3 Results 3.1 Peelability, pectin contents and pectinase activity during fruit maturation The fruits of Clementine and Fremont at 141, 176 and 211 days after petal falling corresponded to the end of fruit expansion (pre-colour break), colour break and maturity, which here were simply defined as Stage 1, 2 and 3 ( Fig. 1A ). Two-way ANOVA showed that both fruit maturation and variety had significant effects ( P < 0.0001) on peel-pulp adherence, peel resistance of penetration, the contents of protopectin, water-soluble and CDTA-soluble pectin and pectinase activity ( Table 1 ). In addition, the maturation-variety interaction also showed highly significant effects ( P < 0.0001) on the two mechanical indexes and moderately significant effects ( P < 0.05) on protopectin content and pectinase activity in both tissues and water and CDTA-soluble pectin contents in albedo ( Table 1 ). At Stage 1/2/3, the peel-pulp adherence and peel resistance to penetration of Fremont was 2.25/2.49/1.93 and 2.29/3.54/1.81 times as those of Clementine, respectively, suggesting Fremont was a hard-peeling mandarin in comparison with Clementine. The two indexes underwent dramatic decline (86.2 % and 65.6 % in Clementine and 78.7 % and 61.9 % in Fremont) from Stage 1 to 2, and decreased mildly or remained unchanged from Stage 2 to Stage 3 ( Fig. 1B , C), indicating peelability increased as fruits matured, especially before colour break. Throughout the maturation, the contents of protopectin, water-soluble and CDTA-soluble pectin were steadily declining in the flavedo of both mandarins ( Fig. 1D-F ), and the pectinase activity was increasing ( Fig. 1G ). The hard-peeling Fremont had overall higher contents of pectin and lower pectinase activity at the same maturation stage ( Fig. 1D-G ). As shown in the Pearson correlation matrix ( Fig. 2 ), the measured indexes were mostly significantly correlated ( P < 0.05) with each other. The peel-pulp adherence were positively correlated with peel resistance of penetration ( r = 0.99), which is consistent with our previous analysis of the peelability of 80 mandarin varieties ( Yu et al., 2021 ). The two mechanical indexes positively correlated with the contents of different pectins (r = 0.52 – 0.93) but negatively correlated with pectinase activity ( r = -0.71 – -0.82). 3.2 Overview of RNA sequencing and DEG identification From the 36 libraries, we identified 18980 protein-encoding genes that were significantly expressed in the peel of Clementine or Fremont (Supplementary Table 2), accounting for 55.94 % of the total protein-encoding genes (33929) in Citrus clementina v1.0. The averaged TPM of the 36 libraries ranged from 0.11 ( Ciclev10023990m.g ) to 13999.9 ( Ciclev10029803m.g ) with mean of 50.3 and median of 16.9. Based on the TPM of all the identified genes from the 36 libraries, Pearson correlation analysis showed that the biological replicates of same variety, tissue and maturation stage mostly clustered together in small clades with r > 0.90 (Fig. S1A). An exception was Fremont albedo at Stage 3 (Fre_Al_3_b), which was outside the Fre_Al_3 clade but constituted a larger clade with Fre_Al_3_a, Fre_Al_3_c and three libraries of Clementine albedo at Stage 2 (Cle_Al_2_a, b, c). Nevertheless, Fre_Al_3_b was more highly correlated with Fre_Al_3_a and Fre_Al_3 ( r = 0.90 and 0.92) than Cle_Al_2_a, b and c ( r = 0.86, 0.86 and 0.83). Although the three libraries of Fremont at Stage 3 were slightly scattered at PC1, the PCA plot shown by two principal components (74 % and 12 % of total variance) could clearly distinguish different varieties, tissues and fruit developmental stages (Fig. S1B). Taken together, our RNA sequencing results were reproducible and suitable for further analysis. With |log2FoldChange| > 1 and P < 0.05 as a cutoff, we identified 12322 DEGs between the two varieties or among the three maturation stages. In the comparison between Clementine and Fremont, there were 3526/3259, 2489/2453 and 2392/2094 DEGs in albedo/flavedo at Stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The numbers of DEGs between the two mandarins were decreasing as the fruits matured. Clementine had 4049/2894 and 2398/3297 DEGs of Stage 1 vs. Stage 2 and Stage 2 vs. Stage 3 in albedo/flavedo, and Fremont had 3020/2783 and 2060/3364. Obviously, Clementine had more DEGs than Fremont with an exception of Stage 2 vs. Stage 3 in flavedo. Together with the peelability results ( Fig 1B and C), six DEG sets (the up/down-regulated DEGs of Stage 1 vs. Stage 2 and Stage 1 vs. Stage 3 in both mandarins as well as down/up-regulated ones of Clementine vs. Fremont at Stage 1 and Stage 2) were consistent with easy/hard peeling, and their intersection could be considered as the DEGs related to easy/hard peeling. Venn analysis identified 61/84 and 66/108 DEGs related to easy/hard peeling in albedo and flavedo ( Fig. 3 , Supplementary Table 2). These easy/hard peeling-related DEGs were annotated with 399/484 GO terms (133/126 biological processes (BPs), 93/120 cellular components (CCs) and 173/238 molecular functions (MFs)), suggesting they were involved in diverse biological activities. Several genes encoding pectinase were implicated in the easy/hard peeling-related DEGs. Ciclev10005117m.g encoding a PAE in albedo and Ciclev10031429m.g encoding a PL in flavedo are easy peeling-relate DEGs, and Ciclev10007940m.g encoding a type I PME in flavedo as hard peeling-related DEG. Besides, Ciclev10002233m.g and Ciclev10032524m.g encoding expansin, which function in mediating cell wall loosening, belonged to the easy peeling-relate DEGs in both tissues. However, no cell wall or pectin-related GO terms were enriched in these DEG sets by using ORA of GO annotation. 3.3 Genes encoding pectinase in mandarin peel According to the two-step procedure (see 2.5), we mined 153 genes encoding pectinase (72 PMEs, 30 PGs, 19 PLs, 23 BGALs, 8 PAEs and 1 AF) in silica from the Clementine reference genome. There were 78 (38 PME, 13 PGs, 8 PLs, 11 BGALs, 7 PAEs and 1 AF) that significantly expressed in the Clementine or Fremont peel. Among them, 62/60 (30/27 PME , 9/11 PGs, 6/5 PLs, 10/10 BGALs, 6/6 PAEs and 1/1 AF) belonged to DEG in albedo/flavedo (Supplementary Table 3), and their expression patterns differed depending on different genes, varieties and different tissues ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table 3). Totally 40 genes (18 PME, 11 PGs, 4 PLs, 5 BGALs, 5 PAEs and 1 AF) encoding pectinase showed higher expression level in the easy-peeling Clementine than the hard-peeling Fremont at least at one maturation stage (Supplementary Table 3). Notably, three PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) were up-regulated by 5.7 – 8.0 times in albedo and 4.4 – 48.0 times in flavedo from Stage 2 to Stage 1, and subsequently decreased at Stage 3 ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table 2). They were top 1.42%, 0.33% and 1.22% high-expressed genes. The mean TPM of Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g in the all libraries were 398.9, 884.7 and 428.8 (Supplementary Table 2), which were 8.4, 19.9 and 9.2 times higher than the average value of the all genes. 3.4 Comparative time-course analysis To display the gene expression profiles of Clementine and Fremont during the fruit maturation, we performed a time-course analysis. Different gene expression patterns ( FDR < 0.05, r 2 > 0.6) were exhibited with 12 clusters ( Fig. 5A and B, Supplementary Table 2), where 13193 and 12483 genes in albedo and flavedo were implicated. The genes in different clusters varied in amount, ranged from 343 (flavedo Cluster12) to 2308 (flavedo Cluster2). Cluster5, 6 and 8 of albedo and Cluster1, 4 and 6 of flavedo represented the gene sets that had higher expression level in easy-peeling Clementine than hard-peeling Fremont at least at one maturation stage. There were 6 (3 PMEs, 5 PGs, 3 PLs, 3 BGALs, 1 PAE and 1 AF) and 26 (5 PMEs, 7 PGs, 4 PLs, 6 BGALs, 3 PAE and 1 AF) pectinase genes in these clusters (Supplementary Table 3). The above-mentioned PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) belonged to albedo Cluster8 and flavedo Cluster1. Although the genes in albedo Cluster10 and flavedo Cluster8 also showed higher expression levels in Clementine, they probably reflected the inherent difference other than peelability because of the nearly unchanged expression level during the fruit maturation. It is reasonably that very few pectinase gene (only one PME) was present in these two clusters. With ORA of GO annotation, 85 and 98 GO terms were over-represented in 9 albedo and 8 flavedo clusters (Supplementary Table 4). Importantly, in albedo and flavedo Cluster6, the enriched terms involved cell wall metabolism including GO:0042546 (cell wall biogenesis, BP), GO:0071555 (cell wall organization, BP), GO:0006073 (cellular glucan metabolic process, BP), GO:0010411 (xyloglucan metabolic process, BP), GO:0005618 (cell wall, CC) and GO:0016762 (xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase activity) ( Fig. 5C , Supplementary Table 4). 3.5 Identification of genes encoding TFs A total of 987 TF genes belonging to 55 families were identified in Clementine or Fremont peel (Supplementary Table 5). MYB/MYB-related, bHLH, ERF, C2H2 and NAC were the top 5 largest families, which contained 125, 82, 76, 58 and 52 members, respectively. Ciclev10032507m.g with 3200.6 TPM, encoding A MIKC (MADS intervening keratin-like and C-terminal)-type MADS-box protein, were most abundant. Besides, four ERFs ( Ciclev10005570m.g, Ciclev10025816m.g, Ciclev10009484m.g and Ciclev10016276m.g ), two C2H2s ( Ciclev10002297m.g and Ciclev10029065m.g ), one bHLH ( Ciclev10031873m.g ), MYB ( Ciclev10021454m.g ) and NAC ( Ciclev10008628m.g ) were also the top 10 TFs. Totally 742 TF genes belonged to DEGs, including 398/336, 482/512 and 228/304 of Stage 1 vs. Stage 2, Stage 1 vs. Stage 3 and Stage 1 vs. Stage 3 in albedo/flavedo, and 207/191, 131/130 and 127/119 of Clementine vs. Fremont at Stage 1, 2 and 3. Among these DE TFs, MYB/MYB-related was the largest family with 84 genes followed by ERF (71), bHLH (66), C2H2 (45), NAC (41) and WRKY (40). Based on the Venn analysis (see 3.2), there were 3 (2 bHLHs and WRKY)/4 (2 bHLHs, bZIP and ERF) easy peeling-related and 9 (2 WOXs, AP2, ERF, GRAS, HSF, MYB, SBP and TCP)/14 (3 ERFs, 2 NACs, B3, bHLH, C2H2, co-like, DBB, GRAS, HD-ZIP, TCP) hard peeling-related TFs in albedo/flavedo (Supplementary Table 5). Ciclev10031873m.g encoding a bHLH protein were the common easy peeling-related TF in both albedo and flavedo, and Ciclev10010825m.g (GRAS), Ciclev10020275m.g (TCP) and Ciclev10024602m.g (ERF) were the common hard peeling-related TF genes in both tissues. In addition, the TFs in the different clusters of comparative time-course analysis and co-expression modules of WGCNA (see 3.6) were summarised in Supplementary Table 5. 3.6 WGCNA With soft power = 6, we identified eight (1032, 801, 630, 481, 429, 251, 247 and 178 genes) and nine (796, 545, 402, 281, 256, 252, 191, 102 and 69 genes) co-expression modules in albedo and flavedo ( Fig. 6 ; Fig. S2, Supplementary Table 2). The eigengene values of Module black, pink, red and yellow in albedo and Module black, brown, red and yellow in flavedo were negatively correlated with the mechanical indexes and pectin contents (except Module red in albedo and flavedo) but positively with pectinase activity (| r | > 0.5, P < 0.05). By contrast, the eigengene values of Module green and turquoise in both albedo and flavedo were positively correlated with mechanical indexes but negatively with pectinase activity (| r | > 0.5, P < 0.05) ( Fig. 6 ). With ORA of GO annotation, 61 (23 BPs, 14 CCs and 24 MFs)/61 (25 BPs, 8 CCs and 28 MFs) GO terms were over-represented in different modules of albedo/flavedo (Supplementary Table 6). They included some pectin or cell wall-related terms such as GO:0030570 (pectate lyase activity, MF) in Module red in albedo and flavedo with enrichment fold of 22.80 and 22.07, GO:0009664 (plant-type cell wall organization, BP) in Module red in albedo and flavedo with 18.57 and 26.97, and GO:0004650 (polygalacturonase activity, MF) in Module red in flavedo with 14.71. In addition, GO:0003700 (transcription factor activity, MF) was slightly but significantly enriched (enrichment fold = 2.04 and 2.26) in Module turquoise in albedo and flavedo. Last, the co-expression undirected networks for albedo and flavedo were respectively constructed. With weight > 0.4 as a cut-off, there were 2453/2279 nodes and 162787/310196 edges in albedo/flavedo (Supplementary Table 7). The partial networks (64/467 nodes and 99/715 edges in albedo/flavedo) that were contained pectinase genes and their directly connecting nodes were illustrated in Fig. 7 . These pectinase-related networks involved six pectinase genes (three PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ), PME ( Ciclev10010616m.g ), BGAL ( Ciclev10000393m.g ) and PAE ( Ciclev10005117m.g )) in albedo, and eight (three PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ), three PMEs ( Ciclev10010616m.g, Ciclev10031872m.g and Ciclev10007993m.g ) and three BGALs ( Ciclev10024881m.g and Ciclev10030257m.g )) in flavedo. In addition, the pectinase-related networks also contained 1 and 46 TF genes in albedo and flavedo. Ciclev10013209m.g encoding a bHLH family protein was present in both networks of albedo and flavedo. Interestingly, Ciclev10013209m.g was co-expressed with the three highlighted PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) in albedo, and with one ( Ciclev10004783m.g ) in flavedo. 3.7 qRT-PCR analysis confirms the results of RNA sequencing To validate the transcriptomic results, the relative expression level of 25 genes were measured by using qRT-PCR. They included 12 pectinase genes (3 PMEs ( Ciclev10007993m.g, Ciclev10010616m.g and Ciclev10031872m.g ), PG ( Ciclev10003286m.g ), 3 PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ), 3 BGALs ( Ciclev10000393m.g, Ciclev10024881m.g and Ciclev10030257m.g ), PAE ( Ciclev10005117m.g ) and AF ( Ciclev10011228m.g )). The others included 5 TF genes ( Ciclev10006315m.g, Ciclev10012453m.g, Ciclev10013209m.g, Ciclev10025844m.g and Ciclev10031873m.g ) in the WGCNA network ( Fig. 7 ), as well as 8 randomly selected. The relative expression level of measured by using the two methods were significantly correlated with r = 0.77 – 0.94 ( P < 0.01) ( Fig. 8 ), thereby substantiating the transcriptomic results in this study. It was worth mentioning that the relative expression of the three above-mentioned PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) measured by qRT-PCR were highly correlated ( r = 0.93, 0.82 and 0.88, P < 0.001) with their TPM values. 4 Discussion Unlike conventional fruit quality traits such as size, sugar and acid contents, colour, taste and flavor, peelability is unique in citrus but often undervalued. Nevertheless, peelability becomes increasingly important in recent years ( Goldenberg et al., 2018 ; Yu et al., 2021 ), because it directly influences the commercial values as consumers favour the easy-peeling citrus than the hard-peeling one ( Simons et al., 2018 ). The physiological and molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying citrus peelability should be paid more attention. The transcriptomic data presented in this study provide clues for understanding the molecular basis of the formation and regulation of citrus peelability. Softening is a hallmark of ripening for most fleshy fruits. Citrus firmness is often used as an index for evaluating maturity ( Hernandez Gomez et al., 2006 ; Olmo et al., 2000 ) and storability at postharvest ( Badiche-El Hilali et al., 2023 ; Chen et al., 2023 ; Shi et al., 2019 ). In this study, as a dual indicator of fruit firmness and peelability, peel resistance of penetration remarkably dropped from Stage 1 to Stage 2 followed by marginal decline from Stage 2 to Stage 3 ( Fig. 1C ), suggesting that citrus softening predominantly occurs before colour break. This observation is distinct from climacteric tomato ( Nie et al., 2022 ; Uluisik et al., 2016 ) and non-climacteric strawberry ( Lin et al., 2023 ), both of which undergo significant softening after colour break. It appears that the different softening pattern is unrelated to fruit respiratory climacteric, and citrus probably has a distinct pre-harvest softening pattern and regulatory mechanism from tomato ( Wang and Seymour, 2022 ) and strawberry (Alejandra Moya-Leon et al., 2019 ; Shi et al., 2023 ). In addition, citrus fruits usually satisfy commercial requirement and are often picked before fully ripening, so the softening is incomparable to that of other fleshy fruits. Muramatsu et al (1999) has reported concomitant decrease in cell wall polysaccharide contents and peel firmness in Satsuma mandarin and hassaku during fruit development. The degradation of cell wall polysaccharides in fruit softening is well recognised and elucidated ( Peng et al., 2022 ; Vicente et al., 2007 ). Based on the chemical structure, cell wall polysaccharides are classified into cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin in plants, and this study highlighted pectin. In this study, the contents of different pectins decreased accompanied by the increase in peelability during fruit maturation ( Fig. 1B–E , Fig. 2 ). Moreover, a pectin-related GO term (GO:0030570, pectate lyase activity, MF) was over-presented in Module red in both albedo and flavedo (Supplementary Table 6), whose eigengene values were negatively correlated with the two mechanical indexes ( Fig. 6 ). These results point to a negative regulation of peelability by pectin. The physiological basis of citrus peelability regulated by pectin likely parallel to that of fruit softening. During fruit ripening and softening, pectin drives cellular separation by reducing turgor and cellular adhesion at middle lamella and tricellular junctions through disaggregation, de-esterification, depolymerisation and solubilisation ( Uluisik et al., 2016 ; Vicente et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2018a ). Interestingly, together with cell wall-related GO terms, some hemicellulose-related terms, such as GO:0006073 (cellular glucan metabolic process, BP), GO:0010411 (xyloglucan metabolic process, BP) and GO:0016762 (xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase activity, MF) were over-presented in albedo and flavedo Cluster6 and peelability-correlated modules ( Fig. 5C , Supplementary Table 4 and 6). Thus, hemicellulose is probably also involved in the regulation of citrus peelability, and should not be ignored for the future research in citrus peelability. Pectin degradation is catalysed via pectinases during fruit ripening and softening ( Wang et al., 2018a ). In this study, pectinase activity increased accompanied by the decreases in mechanical indexes and increases in pectin contents during fruit maturation, and that of the easy-peeling Clementine were overall higher than the hard-peeling Fremont ( Fig. 1B–G ). The pectinase activity negatively correlated with pectin contents and the mechanical indexes ( Fig. 2 ). Based on these observations, pectinase is plausibly a key factor influencing pectin contents and therefore citrus peelability. However, pectinase is not a single but cocktail enzyme. PME, PG, PL, BGAL, PAE and AF, notwithstanding diverse biochemical activity in planta , are all involved in pectin degradation and called pectinases collectively ( Kashyap et al., 2001 ). The predominant pectinase individuals that responsible for fruit softening is likely species-dependent. For instance, PL is more important than PG in the softening of tomato ( Uluisik et al., 2016 ), whereas reverse is true for strawberry ( Posé et al., 2015 ); and BGAL is seemingly crucial for apple ( Gwanpua et al., 2014 ; Yang et al., 2018 ). Although the precise relation between different pectinase individuals and peelability remains further investigation, it should be considered as a target for peelability-oriented citrus breeding. Genome-wide identification of the genes encoding pectinase in citrus is crucial for identifying key players in peelability regulation. This study mined totally 153 genes encoding various pectinases (PME, PG, PL, BGAL, PAE and AF) in silica from Clementine genome, 78 of which were significantly expressed in mandarin peel and 68 of which belonged to DEGs ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table 3). These data not only pave the way for understanding the regulation of peelability at molecular genetic level, but also benefit the study of other pectin-related physiological and developmental events of citrus. The physiological action of PL in fruit (date, pear, rowan and apple) softening has been substantiated with a range of biochemical experiments in vitro and in viv o (Al Hinai et al., 2021 ). Herein we propose that three PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) act as regulators for citrus peelability based on the following observations. (1) They had surprisingly high transcriptional level (top 1.42%, 0.33% and 1.22% high-expressed genes) in peel (Supplementary Table 2), which was confirmed qRT-PCR ( Fig. 8 ). (2) They were remarkably up-regulated in the comparisons of hard peeling (Stage 1 or Fremont) with easy peeling (Stage 2 or Clementine) ( Fig. 4 ). (3) They fell into Module red in flavedo and albedo of the WGCNA, whose eigengene values had negative correlation of peelability indexes with pectin contents ( Fig. 6 ). In other fleshy fruits, some PL homologous genes sharing 60-80% sequence identity with them, such as tomato SlPL ( Uluisik et al., 2016 ; Yang et al., 2017 ) and SlPL16 ( Ren et al., 2023 ), strawberry PLc ( Jiménez-Bermúdez et al., 2002 ; Santiago-Domenech et al., 2008 ), peach PpePL1 and PpePL15 ( Xu et al., 2022 ) grape VvPL15 ( Ma et al., 2023 ), have been demonstrated to play a critical role in fruit ripening and softening through various genetic manipulations and physiological investigation. TFs are master regulators of gene expression at transcriptional level. The enrichment of GO:0003700 (transcription factor activity, MF) in Module turquoise in albedo and flavedo (Supplementary Table 6) implies that the transcription regulation of citrus peelability is non-negligible. Our study identified 742 DE TF genes in peel (Supplementary Table 5), and some of them are plausibly implicated in peelability regulation. For example, Ciclev10024061m.g encoding a WRKY TF, was easy peeling-related in albedo in the Venn analysis (Supplementary Table 5, Fig. 3 ). It has been reported that banana MaWRKY49 ( Liu et al., 2023 ) and strawberry FvWRKY48 ( Zhang et al., 2022 ) promote fruit softening through activating MaPL11 and MaPL3 or FvPLa . Another TF family potentially functions in citrus peelability regulation probably is bHLH protein. We observed one bHLH gene ( Ciclev10031873m.g ), a top 10 high-expressed TF, was easy peeling-related in both albedo and flavedo according to the Venn analysis (Supplementary Table 5, Fig. 3 ), and another bHLH gene ( Ciclev10013209m.g ) was co-expressed with the three important PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) in the WGCNA co-expression networks ( Fig. 7 ). Indeed, in Arabidopsis , two bHLH transcription factors called ALC and IND trigger silique dehiscence ( Rajani and Sundaresan, 2001 ). It is well acknowledged that bHLH TF promote fruit development and ripening in tomato ( Waseem et al., 2019 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ), passionfruit ( Passiflora edulis Sim) ( Liang et al., 2023 ; Xu et al., 2023 ), banana ( Wang et al., 2020 ), peach ( Zhang et al., 2018 ), Chinese jujube ( Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) ( Li et al., 2019 ) and melon ( Tan et al., 2021 ). The transcriptional regulation of citrus peelability through pectinase should be a significant topic in plant biology. 5 Conclusion A range of mechanical and physiological measurements demonstrated that peelability had negative correlation with pectin contents but positive with pectinase activity. The comparative transcriptomic profile of two mandarin varieties (easy-peeling Clementine and hard-peeling Fremont) at three maturation stages was revealed. There were 12322 DEGs in total among the three maturation stages or between the varieties. Through comparative time-course analysis, the different gene expression patterns were displayed with 12 clusters each in albedo and flavedo. Some cell wall-related GO terms were over-represented in a cluster (albedo and flavedo Cluster6). We mined 153 pectinase genes in silica from Clementine genome. Among them, 78 (38 PMEs, 13 PGs, 8 PLs, 11 BGALs, 7 PAEs and 1 AF) were significantly expressed in Clementine or Fremont peel, and 62/60 (30/27 PME, 9/11 PGs, 6/5 PLs, 10/10 BGALs, 6/6 PAEs and 1/1 AF) belonged to DEG in albedo/flavedo. Totally, 987 TF genes from 55 families were significantly expressed in Clementine or Fremont peel. WGCNA identified eight/nine modules in albedo/flavedo, and six/five of them had eigengene values that correlated with the two mechanical indexes, pectin contents and pectinase activity. Six/eight pectinase genes were involved in the co-expression undirected networks of albedo/flavedo. Three PLs ( Ciclev10004783m.g, Ciclev10020423m.g and Ciclev10031429m.g ) were proposed as potential regulators for citrus peelability. Our results provide clues for understanding the molecular basis of the formation and regulation of citrus peelability. Pectinase should be a key target for peelability-oriented citrus breeding.
