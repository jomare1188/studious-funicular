    "full_text": "Abstract The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is a major pest of global citriculture. In the Americas and in Asia, D. citri vectors the phloem-limited bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus ( C Las), which causes the fatal citrus disease huanglongbing, or citrus greening. Cell lines derived from D. citri can provide insight into both the basic biology of this pest and D. citri -associated pathogens including C Las. We previously identified CLG#2 as the optimal medium for long-term growth of D. citri primary cell cultures. Here we report on the establishment and characterization of three continuous D. citri cell lines, Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5, that have been passaged for > 40 times. Based on morphological and transcriptomic data, the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines include undifferentiated and neurogenic progenitor cells. Dici1 and Dici5 are infected with Wolbachia . Both Dici1 and Dici5 are infected with D. citri reovirus, and Dici5 is also infected with D. citri-associated C virus . Dici3 is free of both Wolbachia and virus infection. These cell lines provide an ideal platform for the study of inter-microbial relationships as well as microbe interaction with host insect cells."

On the basis that the bacterium replicates within the insect vector, establishment of continuous D. citri cell lines may allow for in vitro C Las replication."

The CLG#2 medium consisted of EX-CELL 420 (Sigma-Aldrich, 14420C) + L-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, L1518) media at a 1:1 ratio, 9% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, F4135), and penicillin and streptomycin (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, US; 15–070-063) at 100 U/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively 39 . Cells were passaged when the growth of a primary culture entered a stationary phase despite weekly medium replacement, or when the monolayer confluency of a subculture was ≥ 80% for Dici1 (derived from primary culture 2021-9-27#1) and Dici3 (derived from primary culture 2022-2-14#1) 39 , or 70% for Dici5 (derived from primary culture 2022-3-16#1). The Dici5 cell line was established in a manner similar to that used for Dici1 and Dici3 39 . To dissociate attached cells from the flask, the old medium was removed, and cells were briefly rinsed in 1X PBS (Fisher Scientific, 20012027) before trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin–EDTA (Fisher Scientific, 25–300-054) for 2–3 min at 22 °C. After cells became loosely attached, trypsin was removed by aspiration before 2 mL of fresh medium was added to the flask to stop the trypsinization. Cells were suspended in the fresh medium and half of the cell suspension (1 mL), containing approximately 3–4 × 10 6 live cells, was transferred into a new T25 flask containing 4 mL of CLG#2 medium. Approximately 4 duplicate subcultures for each cell line were maintained at any given time, with subcultures passaged on a staggered schedule. This approach ensured continuation of the cell line in case some subcultures were lost."

The remaining three cell lines with robust growth rates were passaged more than 40 times and were designated as continuous cell lines Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 (Table 2 ). The three lines differ in their ability to reach full confluency and passaging intervals, with Dici3 having the shortest passaging interval of 7 days (Table 2 ). While all Dici3 and Dici5 subcultures were passaged successfully, eleven Dici1 subcultures in 7 passages were lost due to cell death (Table 2 ). Notably, those lost Dici1 subcultures appeared indistinguishable from other subcultures that remained healthy before they crashed. Due to the maintenance of duplicate subcultures that survived, the Dici1 line was maintained for > 40 passages (Table 2 ). As of June 2024, Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 had reached passages, 48, 57, and 42, respectively. Table 2 Overview of continuous Diaphorina citri cell lines.

The vast majority of elongated cells in Dici1 and Dici5 are spindle-shaped or stellate-shaped cells with fine, elongated processes, resembling neurons or fibroblasts. The spherical cells in Dici1 and Dici5 tend to aggregate and form clusters (Fig. 1 A,B,E,F). By comparison, the elongated cells in the Dici3 line possess more diverse morphology. While some of the Dici3 cells have a neuron (or fibroblast)-like morphology, many cells have more rectangular cell bodies and lack elongated processes, suggestive of a different origin (e.g. epithelial). Furthermore, the spherical cells in Dici3 do not tend to form clusters (Fig. 1 C,D). A growth curve was generated for Dici3, the cell line with the shortest passaging interval. The population doubling time was estimated to be approximately 5 days during the exponential growth phase (Supplementary Fig. S1 online).

The average query coverage and percent identity of sequences annotated as D. citri -associated Wolbachia were 67.8% and 99.3% for Dici1, and 34.2% and 98.5% for Dici3. The completeness of the Wolbachia genome, as indicated by the BUSCO score, is significantly higher in Dici1 compared to Dici3 (Table 4 ), suggesting that only the former cell line is infected with the bacterium. The BUSCO scores for Burkholderiales in both cell lines are approximately one-fifth those of Wolbachia (Table 4 ). Given these low BUSCO scores, it is likely that these Burkholderiales transcripts represent either integrated sequences or contamination. As expected, no transcripts of Carsonella or Profftella , which are vertically transmitted on the exterior of the egg, were found in the transcriptomes of the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines. These bacteria would have been removed during washing of the eggs prior to establishment of the primary cell cultures 39 . The distribution of all bacterial sequences is illustrated in pie charts (visualized using Krona) in Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 for Dici1 and Dici3, respectively.

Eight cell lines either were lost due to cell death after several passages or had slow growth rates (data not shown). The remaining three cell lines with robust growth rates were passaged more than 40 times and were designated as continuous cell lines Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 (Table 2 ). The three lines differ in their ability to reach full confluency and passaging intervals, with Dici3 having the shortest passaging interval of 7 days (Table 2 ). While all Dici3 and Dici5 subcultures were passaged successfully, eleven Dici1 subcultures in 7 passages were lost due to cell death (Table 2 ). Notably, those lost Dici1 subcultures appeared indistinguishable from other subcultures that remained healthy before they crashed. Due to the maintenance of duplicate subcultures that survived, the Dici1 line was maintained for > 40 passages (Table 2 ).

The spherical cells in Dici1 and Dici5 tend to aggregate and form clusters (Fig. 1 A,B,E,F). By comparison, the elongated cells in the Dici3 line possess more diverse morphology. While some of the Dici3 cells have a neuron (or fibroblast)-like morphology, many cells have more rectangular cell bodies and lack elongated processes, suggestive of a different origin (e.g. epithelial). Furthermore, the spherical cells in Dici3 do not tend to form clusters (Fig. 1 C,D). A growth curve was generated for Dici3, the cell line with the shortest passaging interval.

The average query coverage and percent identity of sequences annotated as D. citri -associated Wolbachia were 67.8% and 99.3% for Dici1, and 34.2% and 98.5% for Dici3. The completeness of the Wolbachia genome, as indicated by the BUSCO score, is significantly higher in Dici1 compared to Dici3 (Table 4 ), suggesting that only the former cell line is infected with the bacterium. The BUSCO scores for Burkholderiales in both cell lines are approximately one-fifth those of Wolbachia (Table 4 ). Given these low BUSCO scores, it is likely that these Burkholderiales transcripts represent either integrated sequences or contamination. As expected, no transcripts of Carsonella or Profftella , which are vertically transmitted on the exterior of the egg, were found in the transcriptomes of the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines. These bacteria would have been removed during washing of the eggs prior to establishment of the primary cell cultures 39 . The distribution of all bacterial sequences is illustrated in pie charts (visualized using Krona) in Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 for Dici1 and Dici3, respectively.

Eight cell lines either were lost due to cell death after several passages or had slow growth rates (data not shown). The remaining three cell lines with robust growth rates were passaged more than 40 times and were designated as continuous cell lines Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 (Table 2 ). The three lines differ in their ability to reach full confluency and passaging intervals, with Dici3 having the shortest passaging interval of 7 days (Table 2 ). While all Dici3 and Dici5 subcultures were passaged successfully, eleven Dici1 subcultures in 7 passages were lost due to cell death (Table 2 ). Notably, those lost Dici1 subcultures appeared indistinguishable from other subcultures that remained healthy before they crashed. Due to the maintenance of duplicate subcultures that survived, the Dici1 line was maintained for > 40 passages (Table 2 ).

The vast majority of elongated cells in Dici1 and Dici5 are spindle-shaped or stellate-shaped cells with fine, elongated processes, resembling neurons or fibroblasts. The spherical cells in Dici1 and Dici5 tend to aggregate and form clusters (Fig. 1 A,B,E,F). By comparison, the elongated cells in the Dici3 line possess more diverse morphology. While some of the Dici3 cells have a neuron (or fibroblast)-like morphology, many cells have more rectangular cell bodies and lack elongated processes, suggestive of a different origin (e.g. epithelial). Furthermore, the spherical cells in Dici3 do not tend to form clusters (Fig. 1 C,D). A growth curve was generated for Dici3, the cell line with the shortest passaging interval. The population doubling time was estimated to be approximately 5 days during the exponential growth phase (Supplementary Fig. S1 online).

The average query coverage and percent identity of sequences annotated as D. citri -associated Wolbachia were 67.8% and 99.3% for Dici1, and 34.2% and 98.5% for Dici3. The completeness of the Wolbachia genome, as indicated by the BUSCO score, is significantly higher in Dici1 compared to Dici3 (Table 4 ), suggesting that only the former cell line is infected with the bacterium. The BUSCO scores for Burkholderiales in both cell lines are approximately one-fifth those of Wolbachia (Table 4 ). Given these low BUSCO scores, it is likely that these Burkholderiales transcripts represent either integrated sequences or contamination. As expected, no transcripts of Carsonella or Profftella , which are vertically transmitted on the exterior of the egg, were found in the transcriptomes of the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines. These bacteria would have been removed during washing of the eggs prior to establishment of the primary cell cultures 39 . The distribution of all bacterial sequences is illustrated in pie charts (visualized using Krona) in Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 for Dici1 and Dici3, respectively.

Among the tissue-specific markers, Notch1, a marker for undifferentiated or neurogenic progenitor cells, had the highest transcript levels in Dici1 and Dici3 (Table 3 ). CPM values greater than 10 are considered meaningful for tissue-specific marker transcripts. Most (five out of seven) of the oocyte marker transcripts were also detected in both cell lines, with DDX4 as the most abundant oocyte marker gene (Table 3 ).

The average query coverage and percent identity of sequences annotated as D. citri -associated Wolbachia were 67.8% and 99.3% for Dici1, and 34.2% and 98.5% for Dici3. The completeness of the Wolbachia genome, as indicated by the BUSCO score, is significantly higher in Dici1 compared to Dici3 (Table 4 ), suggesting that only the former cell line is infected with the bacterium. The BUSCO scores for Burkholderiales in both cell lines are approximately one-fifth those of Wolbachia (Table 4 ). Given these low BUSCO scores, it is likely that these Burkholderiales transcripts represent either integrated sequences or contamination. As expected, no transcripts of Carsonella or Profftella , which are vertically transmitted on the exterior of the egg, were found in the transcriptomes of the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines. These bacteria would have been removed during washing of the eggs prior to establishment of the primary cell cultures 39 . The distribution of all bacterial sequences is illustrated in pie charts (visualized using Krona) in Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 for Dici1 and Dici3, respectively.

The average query coverage and percent identity of sequences annotated as D. citri -associated Wolbachia were 67.8% and 99.3% for Dici1, and 34.2% and 98.5% for Dici3. The completeness of the Wolbachia genome, as indicated by the BUSCO score, is significantly higher in Dici1 compared to Dici3 (Table 4 ), suggesting that only the former cell line is infected with the bacterium. The BUSCO scores for Burkholderiales in both cell lines are approximately one-fifth those of Wolbachia (Table 4 ). Given these low BUSCO scores, it is likely that these Burkholderiales transcripts represent either integrated sequences or contamination. As expected, no transcripts of Carsonella or Profftella , which are vertically transmitted on the exterior of the egg, were found in the transcriptomes of the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines. These bacteria would have been removed during washing of the eggs prior to establishment of the primary cell cultures 39 . The distribution of all bacterial sequences is illustrated in pie charts (visualized using Krona) in Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 for Dici1 and Dici3, respectively.

We have generated three continuous cell lines derived from D. citri embryos 39 , each of which has been passaged more than 40 times. Dici3 appears to be the most robust of the three lines due to its short passaging interval. Few Wolbachia transcripts were detected in the Dici3 transcriptome. Importantly, no Wolbachia -specific gene fragments were amplified from Dici3 genomic DNA and no Wolbachia FtsZ protein was detected in Dici3 cells by immunohistology. Taken together, these data suggest that Wolbachia is absent from Dici3 cells. Furthermore, Dici3 appears to be free of viral infection. Therefore, of the cell lines generated in this study, Dici3, as a virus- and Wolbachia -free cell line, appears to be best suited for the growth and study of D. citri -associated pathogens such as C Las."

Interestingly, unlike marker genes from other tissues such as gut and hemocyte, most neuronal marker gene transcripts were detected in both transcriptomes with many in high abundance. These results indicate that Dici1 and Dici3 may consist of a large number of neuronal progenitors, which is consistent with the fibroblast-like morphology of many cells in these lines. Dici3 is also comprised of cells with non-fibroblast-like morphology, raising the possibility that sublines containing different types of cells may be generated from this line. The presence of multiple markers with low CPM values, combined with expression of markers such as Notch1, headcase and prospero indicates that Dici1 and Dici3 consist predominantly of non-differentiated or early-stage cells. Expression of elav and vacht for example, which are markers of mature neuronal populations was undetected or detected only at low levels (Table 3 ). It is important to note that Notch1, headcase and prospero are not strict markers for specific cell types, but rather dynamic indicators of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and lineage commitment."

Pathogen infections are dynamic within insect populations with only a subset of individuals typically infected at a given time.

While doxycycline treatment negatively impacted insect fitness levels 28 , no overt effect of doxycycline on the morphology or growth of Dici1 or Dici5 cells was observed during two weeks of treatment. Wolbachia could potentially be eliminated from subcultures of the Dici1 and Dici5 cell lines with prolonged doxycycline treatment for assessment of Wolbachia impacts on D. citri cells and on replication of the viruses present in the respective cell lines. Conversely, a subculture of Dici3 could be infected with Wolbachia as a Wolbachia only treatment, although DcRV may also be present in a Dici1 or Dici5-derived inoculum."

    "full_text": "Introduction Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as citrus greening disease, has been found in citrus-growing regions around the world since 1919, devastating citrus crops by reducing fruit quality and yield and eventually causing tree death 1 , 2 , 3 – 4 . In the United States, HLB poses a significant threat to citrus production in California having decimated the citrus industry in Florida 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 – 9 . HLB has resulted in billions of dollars in economic loss since its detection in Florida in 2005 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 – 14 . The Gram-negative Alphaproteobacterium “ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” ( C Las) is the presumed causative agent of HLB in the United States and Asia. This fastidious bacterium replicates exclusively in the phloem cells of citrus and in the insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae). In D. citri , C Las is detected both extracellularly and intracellularly in different tissues throughout the psyllid’s lifecycle 6 , 15 . The ability to culture C Las in vitro would advance our knowledge of its biology, facilitate the development of control tools, and allow for validation of the hypothesis that C Las causes HLB through the testing of Koch’s postulates. Numerous attempts to grow C Las in the absence of other bacteria have been unsuccessful 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 – 20 . On the basis that the bacterium replicates within the insect vector, establishment of continuous D. citri cell lines may allow for in vitro C Las replication. In addition to C Las, the microbiome of D. citri includes viruses and endosymbiotic bacteria including Wolbachia and two other bacteria (i.e. Carsonella and Profftella ) that are only found in a specialized organ called the bacteriome 21 , 22 , 23 – 24 . Wolbachia , which infects 50–60% of arthropod species, is widely found in both field-collected and lab-reared D. citri populations 25 , 26 , 27 – 28 . Wolbachia appears to have antiviral impacts in some species 29 , which have been exploited for the management of dengue virus transmission 30 , 31 . Reduced Wolbachia levels are reported to correlate with decreased fitness and increased C Las acquisition in D. citri adults and nymphs 28 , suggesting that Wolbachia could be used to reduce C Las loads in D. citri . Six viruses that infect D. citri have been identified: D. citri reovirus (DcRV), D. citri - associated C virus (DcACV), D. citri flavi-like virus (DcFLV), D. citri densovirus (DcDNV), D. citri picorna-like virus (DcPLV), and D. citri cimodo-like virus (DcCLV) 21 , 24 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 – 37 . All six viruses were present in field-collected D. citri in Florida, with DcACV in 60% of the samples being the most prevalent 21 , 32 , 38 . The relationships between Wolbachia and D. citri -associated viruses and between Wolbachia and C Las, in addition to the fundamental biology of these microbes, remain poorly understood due to the lack of a tractable cell culture system. For this study, we produced three continuous D. citri cell lines from previously generated primary cultures 39 . Characterization of these cell lines through transcriptomics, Sanger sequencing, and immunohistochemistry highlighted differences between the lines in cell type, Wolbachia and virus infection status. These cell lines provide an excellent foundation for analysis of the impact of Wolbachia on D. citri viruses, and potentially also on C Las replication. Methods Subculture of D. citri cell lines and antibiotic treatment D. citri embryo-derived cell cultures were maintained at 28 °C in sealed T25 flasks (Fisher Scientific, FB012936) containing 5 mL of CLG#2 medium each. The CLG#2 medium consisted of EX-CELL 420 (Sigma-Aldrich, 14420C) + L-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, L1518) media at a 1:1 ratio, 9% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, F4135), and penicillin and streptomycin (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, US; 15–070-063) at 100 U/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively 39 . Cells were passaged when the growth of a primary culture entered a stationary phase despite weekly medium replacement, or when the monolayer confluency of a subculture was ≥ 80% for Dici1 (derived from primary culture 2021-9-27#1) and Dici3 (derived from primary culture 2022-2-14#1) 39 , or 70% for Dici5 (derived from primary culture 2022-3-16#1). The Dici5 cell line was established in a manner similar to that used for Dici1 and Dici3 39 . To dissociate attached cells from the flask, the old medium was removed, and cells were briefly rinsed in 1X PBS (Fisher Scientific, 20012027) before trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin–EDTA (Fisher Scientific, 25–300-054) for 2–3 min at 22 °C. After cells became loosely attached, trypsin was removed by aspiration before 2 mL of fresh medium was added to the flask to stop the trypsinization. Cells were suspended in the fresh medium and half of the cell suspension (1 mL), containing approximately 3–4 × 10 6 live cells, was transferred into a new T25 flask containing 4 mL of CLG#2 medium. Approximately 4 duplicate subcultures for each cell line were maintained at any given time, with subcultures passaged on a staggered schedule. This approach ensured continuation of the cell line in case some subcultures were lost. Doxycycline stock solution (5 mg/mL), made by dissolving doxycycline hyclate powder (MilliporeSigma, D9891) in ultrapure water, was filter sterilized using a 0.2 µm syringe filter (Fisher Scientific, NC0789382) and stored in aliquots at −20 °C before use. Doxycycline was applied to Dici1 and Dici5 cells at final concentrations of 0.25 or 0.5 µg/mL, as previously described for elimination of Wolbachia from a mosquito cell line 40 . Doxycycline treatment continued for 14 days during which doxycycline was fully replenished every 3–4 days or on subculturing. Growth analysis Dici3 cells at passage 44 (P44) were dissociated as described above and the cell suspension was used to inoculate 24 T25 flasks at a density of 1.15 × 10 6 cells/flask. Flasks were incubated at 28 °C. Cells from three flasks were harvested through trypsinization as described above before being stained with 0.4% trypan blue (Fisher Scientific, 15–250-061) every 48 h and the live cells were counted using a Countess™ 3 automatic cell counter (ThermoFisher Scientific, AMQAX2000). Confirmation of cell line identity, detection of virus and Wolbachia sequences Genomic DNA was extracted from approximately 4 × 10 6 cells for Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 cell lines, and 50 D. citri embryos using a Monarch genomic DNA purification kit (New England Biolabs, T3010S). DNA was eluted in 100 µl of elution buffer and quantified using a NanoDrop™ One spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, ND-ONE-W). Each 20 µl PCR reaction contained 1X DreamTaq Green PCR Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, K1081), 0.25 µM of forward and reverse primers (Table 1 ), 50 ng of genomic DNA, and water. The following thermocycler profile was used: 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C ( cox1 and β-actin )/52 °C ( Wolbachia ftsz )/54 °C ( Wolbachia wsp ) for 30 s, 72 °C for 90 s; and 72 °C for 5 min.

To test the presence of D. citri viruses, total RNA was extracted from approximately 4 × 10 6 cells homogenized in 200 µl of TRI Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, AM9738) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA pellets were dried and dissolved in 50 µl of water and quantified using a NanoDrop™ One spectrophotometer. cDNA was synthesized using 0.5 mg of RNA with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific, 18080093) and 50 ng of random hexamers. The PCRs were performed in a 20 µl reaction containing 1 µl of diluted cDNA (1:10, v/v), 0.25 µM of forward and reverse primers, 1X DreamTaq Green PCR Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, K1081), and water. Partial fragments of the DcACV RNA1 gene (473 bp) and DcRV p8 gene (900 bp) were amplified using virus-specific forward and reverse primers (Table 1 ), as described previously 21 . The following thermocycler profile was used: 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s; and 72 °C for 5 min. The cox1 , Wolbachia ftsz and wsp , DcACV RNA1, and DcRV p8 PCR products were gel-purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced by Azenta/GENEWIZ (Burlington, MA, USA). RNA-seq and transcriptome analysis Cell pellets of Dici1 (P18) and Dici3 (P24) containing approximately 4 × 10 6 cells each were shipped to Azenta/GENEWIZ for RNA extraction, transcriptomic sequencing, and de novo transcriptome assembly. After RNA extraction, rRNA was removed using a QIAseq FastSelect-rRNA Fly Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). cDNA was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (2 × 150 bp). FastQC and Trimmomatic were used to assess read data and trim adapter sequences and low-quality reads, respectively 41 , 42 . A separate de novo assembly was generated for each sample using Trinity v2.5.1 43 , followed by quality assessment using TransRate v1.0.3 44 . The remainder of the analyses were performed on the supercomputer HiPerGator at the University of Florida. A combined de novo assembly was also generated from Dici1 and Dici3 reads using Trinity 43 . Assembly completeness was evaluated using BUSCO v4 45 : transcripts from individual sample assemblies and the combined assembly were aligned to the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs) of the Hemiptera lineage. To investigate the microbial sequence composition of transcriptomes, contiguous sequences (contigs, generated from overlapping reads) from the Dici1 and Dici3 assemblies were mapped to the Diaphorina citri genome (Diaci_v3.0, with endosymbiont sequences removed) from citrusgreening.org 46 using Minimap2 and a divergence allowance of 20% 47 . Similarly, non-host reads were obtained by mapping reads to the D. citri genome using BWA-MEM 48 , 49 . Reads and contigs that did not map to the D. citri genome (non- D. citri, or host-filtered contigs/reads) were extracted from the alignment file with SAMtools 50 . Non- D. citri contigs were used for microbial sequence composition analysis by MMSeqs2 (v14) 51 . Taxonomy assignment against the NCBI nonredundant database 52 was performed using the default algorithm for computing the lowest common ancestor and a minimum open reading frame length of 75 amino acids. Taxonomy results were summarized using the Krona module in MMseqs2 53 . Microbial sequences of interest were verified for further analysis. Dici1 and Dici3 transcriptomes were analyzed for the presence of transcripts of D. citri -associated bacteria that include “ Candidatus Carsonella ruddii” (Gammaproteobacteria: Oceanospirillales), “ Candidatus Profftella armatura” (Betaproteobacteria: Betaproteobacteria incertae sedis), and Wolbachia (Alphaproteobacteria: Rickettsiales) 22 , 23 . Wolbachia (number of orthologs: 364) and Burkholderiales (number of orthologs: 688) lineages are available in BUSCO v4, therefore BUSCO scores were calculated using the non-host contigs from Dici1 or Dici3 as a measure of sequence completeness for these bacteria. For analysis of DcRV sequences, non-host reads were mapped to the D. citri reovirus genome (GenBank: GCA_031538165.1) 33 . Read coverage and read depth were calculated using SAMtools. To quantify the abundance of transcripts in each sample, reads from Dici1 and Dici3 were separately mapped to the combined transcriptome using Salmon (v1.10.1) 54 . The abundance quantification files (containing raw counts) from Salmon were imported into RStudio (v4.3.0) for analysis of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) using NOISeq 55 . Five technical replicates were simulated during NOISeq analysis, and 20% of the total reads were used to simulate each replicate. Additionally, upper quartile normalization and length correction were performed. The DETs with a probability threshold greater than 0.9 (q = 0.9) were extracted. NOISeq generated transcript expression levels in counts per million (CPM) were used for fold enrichment analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of Dici1 and Dici3 transcripts was performed using eggNOG-mapper (v2.1.6) 56 . Fold enrichment analysis was performed on metabolic, developmental, reproductive, and immune system biological process (BP) GO terms on the transcripts of each cell line. No cross-comparisons were made. Fold enrichment analysis was calculated as follows: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{log}}_{2}(fold \\, enrichment)= {\\text{log}}_{2}\\left(\\frac{Unique \\, transcripts \\, for \\, a \\, particular \\, GO \\, term*100}{Total \\, unique \\, transcripts}\\right)$$\\end{document} Fold enrichment analysis was performed on transcripts ≥ 10 CPM. For analysis of tissue-specific marker genes, neuronal and other tissue marker genes were used based on those reported from humans and from insects 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 – 62 . Wolbachia imaging by use of immunofluorescence confocal microscopy Approximately 1 × 10 6 Dici1 (P43) and Dici3 (P49) cells were seeded per well in 2-well cell culture slides (MatTek, Ashland, MA, USA). The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h after being incubated at 28 °C for 24 h. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween20; ThermoFisher Scientific, J61196.AP + 28320), followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X 100 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A16046.AE) in PBS for 30 min. Post permeabilization, cells were washed three times with PBST and blocked with blocking buffer (1.5% BSA in PBS) for three hours and then incubated with 3.5 µg/mL of Wolbachia FtsZ specific polyclonal antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, PA5-117590) in blocking buffer. After three washes with PBST, the cells were incubated for 2 h with 2 µg/mL of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, A31627). Cells were washed with PBST three times before being mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant containing DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific, P36971) and viewed using a Zeiss confocal system LSM800 microscope. D. citri virus preparation Approximately 1000 field-collected psyllids (~ 600 adults and 400 nymphs) were mixed with 10 mL of 0.01 M phosphate buffer in a 50 mL conical tube (Fisher Scientific, 14–432-22). The tube was then placed in liquid nitrogen for 5 min to freeze the psyllid sample. After freezing, the sample was homogenized as it thawed at room temperature using a polytron homogenizer (VWR, PT 2500 E). The lysate was centrifuged at 5000× g for 15 min to remove debris. The supernatant (~ 9 mL) was collected before being treated with 4 µL of Benzonase nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich, E1014) for 45 min on ice to degrade psyllid nucleic acids. The resulting lysate was then centrifuged at 43,590× g for 25 min, and the supernatant was collected. To enrich D. citri viruses, the supernatant was mixed with 2.3% (w/v) NaCl and 7% (w/v) PEG8000 (Sigma-Aldrich, 154660) on a stir plate at 4 °C overnight. The sample was then centrifuged at 17,400× g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of chilled SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5). After incubating on ice for 1 h, the sample was passed through an 18-gauge needle five times to further degrade any remaining psyllid nucleic acids. The sample was then centrifuged at 12,000× g for 15 min, and the virus-enriched supernatant collected. The supernatant (~ 3 mL) was filter-sterilized using a 0.2 µm syringe filter (Fisher Scientific, NC0789382), then mixed with an equal volume of 60% glycerol. Virus samples were stored as 400 µL aliquots at −80 °C. DNA/RNA extraction was performed using 50 µL of the virus stock, following the manufacturer’s protocol, as described above. Results Establishment of D. citri cell lines Eleven promising cell lines were generated from 41 D. citri primary cultures. Eight cell lines either were lost due to cell death after several passages or had slow growth rates (data not shown). The remaining three cell lines with robust growth rates were passaged more than 40 times and were designated as continuous cell lines Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 (Table 2 ). The three lines differ in their ability to reach full confluency and passaging intervals, with Dici3 having the shortest passaging interval of 7 days (Table 2 ). While all Dici3 and Dici5 subcultures were passaged successfully, eleven Dici1 subcultures in 7 passages were lost due to cell death (Table 2 ). Notably, those lost Dici1 subcultures appeared indistinguishable from other subcultures that remained healthy before they crashed. Due to the maintenance of duplicate subcultures that survived, the Dici1 line was maintained for > 40 passages (Table 2 ). As of June 2024, Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 had reached passages, 48, 57, and 42, respectively. Table 2 Overview of continuous Diaphorina citri cell lines.

All three lines consist of adherent cells that are spherical or elongated in shape. These cells show differences in morphology and organization (Fig. 1 ). The vast majority of elongated cells in Dici1 and Dici5 are spindle-shaped or stellate-shaped cells with fine, elongated processes, resembling neurons or fibroblasts. The spherical cells in Dici1 and Dici5 tend to aggregate and form clusters (Fig. 1 A,B,E,F). By comparison, the elongated cells in the Dici3 line possess more diverse morphology. While some of the Dici3 cells have a neuron (or fibroblast)-like morphology, many cells have more rectangular cell bodies and lack elongated processes, suggestive of a different origin (e.g. epithelial). Furthermore, the spherical cells in Dici3 do not tend to form clusters (Fig. 1 C,D). A growth curve was generated for Dici3, the cell line with the shortest passaging interval. The population doubling time was estimated to be approximately 5 days during the exponential growth phase (Supplementary Fig. S1 online). Fig. 1 Photomicrographs of Diaphorina citri cell lines Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5. The morphology and organization of Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 cells remained relatively consistent between different passages. Clusters of spherical cells in Dici1 and Dici5 are indicated (arrows). The passage number (P) at which each photograph was taken is indicated. Cytochrome-c oxidase subunit 1 ( cox1 ) PCR using genomic DNA from Dici1, Dici3, Dici5 cells, and D. citri embryos all produced products of the expected size (Supplementary Fig. S2). An alignment of cox1 PCR amplicon sequences further confirmed that these cell lines were derived from D. citri (Supplementary Fig. S2). Transcriptomic analysis of Dici1 and Dici3 We further characterized Dici1 and Dici3 cells by sequencing their transcriptomes. RNA extracted from the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines had high RNA integrity numbers (RIN) (Supplementary Table S1). Additionally, the sequencing depth, exceeding 100 million reads per sample, was comparable for both samples. Individual transcriptomes for Dici1 and Dici3 contained 271,288 and 272,973 contigs, with an N50 of 1444 and 1414 bp, respectively. The assembly generated from the combined reads from both Dici1 and Dici3 contained approximately 400,000 contigs with an N50 of 1515. The percentage of complete BUSCOs evaluated against the hemipteran lineage was highest for the combined assembly (92.3%), compared to 88.1% and 90.0% for the Dici1 and Dici3 assemblies, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Fold enrichment analysis on metabolic, developmental, reproductive, and immune system Biological Process (BP) Gene Ontology (GO) terms showed that metabolic and developmental were the top 2 BP terms enriched in both cell lines (Supplementary Table S2). A further fold enrichment analysis performed on the BP GO terms associated with the developmental process revealed that nervous system development was the most enriched development process term, which was enriched by 2.86- and threefold in Dici1 and Dici3 transcriptomes, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). Tissue-specific marker gene transcripts Analysis of tissue-specific marker genes showed that most of the neuronal marker gene transcripts (14 out of 16) were detected in Dici1 and Dici3 (Table 3 ). Among the tissue-specific markers, Notch1, a marker for undifferentiated or neurogenic progenitor cells, had the highest transcript levels in Dici1 and Dici3 (Table 3 ). CPM values greater than 10 are considered meaningful for tissue-specific marker transcripts. Most (five out of seven) of the oocyte marker transcripts were also detected in both cell lines, with DDX4 as the most abundant oocyte marker gene (Table 3 ). While seven out of 14 gut marker transcripts were detected, transcripts from only one of seven marker genes were detected for each of hemocytes, and fat body tissue (Table 3 ).

Microbial transcripts Among the bacterial sequences previously identified in D. citri , only those from Wolbachia and Burkholderiales were detected in the Dici1 and Dici3 transcriptomes (Table 4 ). The average query coverage and percent identity of sequences annotated as D. citri -associated Wolbachia were 67.8% and 99.3% for Dici1, and 34.2% and 98.5% for Dici3. The completeness of the Wolbachia genome, as indicated by the BUSCO score, is significantly higher in Dici1 compared to Dici3 (Table 4 ), suggesting that only the former cell line is infected with the bacterium. The BUSCO scores for Burkholderiales in both cell lines are approximately one-fifth those of Wolbachia (Table 4 ). Given these low BUSCO scores, it is likely that these Burkholderiales transcripts represent either integrated sequences or contamination. As expected, no transcripts of Carsonella or Profftella , which are vertically transmitted on the exterior of the egg, were found in the transcriptomes of the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines. These bacteria would have been removed during washing of the eggs prior to establishment of the primary cell cultures 39 . The distribution of all bacterial sequences is illustrated in pie charts (visualized using Krona) in Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 for Dici1 and Dici3, respectively.

Fungi associated with D. citri include Aspergillus niger , Aureobasidium pullulans , Golubevia pallescens , and Acremonium sclerotigenum 63 . While absent in Dici1, a small number of sequences from Aspergillus niger were present in Dici3 (Table 4 ). The identity of all fungal sequences is shown in Supplementary Fig. S5 and S6. Several transcripts originating from D. citri reovirus (DcRV) (NCBI BioProject accession ID PRJNA293863) were identified by BLASTx analysis. For Dici1, the contigs with 100% query cover had 95% or greater amino acid identity to DcRV transcripts from the NCBI database, although the sequences with lower percentage identities (the lowest being 67.8%) also had low query coverage (< 10%). DcRV transcripts in Dici3, most of which had > 99% query cover had percent amino acid identities ranging between 95 and 100%. As there are only seven DcRV amino acid sequences from BioProject PRJNA293863, Dici1 and Dici3 transcripts were mapped against a different, complete DcRV genome (GenBank: GCA_031538165.1). Among known D. citri viruses, only DcRV transcripts were identified in Dici1 and Dici3 transcriptomes. The transcript sequences for all ten segments of DcRV were identified in both transcriptomes, with a greater abundance of transcripts in Dici1 (Table 5 ). The mean read depths for DcRV genes were on average 380-fold (+ /- 14.7) higher in Dici1 than Dici3, suggesting that Dici1, but not Dici3 cells, are likely infected with DcRV (Table 5 ). The identity of all virus sequences identified is shown in Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8. Apart from DcRV, no other D. citri viruses were detected in the transcriptomes of Dici1 and Dici3.

Validation of microbial infection in D. citri cells To test the hypothesis that the Dici1 cell line, but not Dici3, is infected with Wolbachia and DcRV, we performed gene-specific PCR and RT-PCR. Fragments of two Wolbachia -specific genes, ftsz and wsp , were detected in the genomic DNA of Dici1 but not Dici3 (Fig. 2 A). A partial fragment (900 bp) of the p8 gene of DcRV was amplified from the cDNA of Dici1, but not Dici3 (Fig. 3 A), supporting the notion that Dici1, but not Dici3 cells, are infected with DcRV. Sequencing results of these gene-specific PCR products confirmed their identity (Fig. 2 and 3 ). Both Dici1 and Dici3 were negative for other viral sequences (i.e. DcACV, DcFLV, and DcCLV; data not shown) when tested by RT-PCR. Fig. 2 PCR of Wolbachia ftsz and wsp confirms the presence of Wolbachia in Dici1 and Dici5, but not Dici3 cells. ( A ) Partial fragments of Wolbachia ftsz (1043 bp) and wsp (570 bp) were amplified from Dici1 (Passage 27, GenBank: PP894982 for ftsz and PP894984 for wsp ) and Dici5 (Passage 33, GenBank: PP894983 for ftsz and PP894985 for wsp ), but not Dici3 (Passage 46), genomic DNA. NTC: no template control. Arrows indicate PCR products at the expected sizes. GeneRuler 1 kb plus DNA ladder (ThermoFisher Scientific, SM1332) was used as a DNA marker. Two weeks of doxycycline treatment reduced the levels of ftsz and wsp in Dici1 ( B ) and Dici5 ( C ) cells. Fig. 3 Evaluation of viral infection status in Diaphorina citri cell lines. ( A ) DcRV RT-PCR confirms the presence of this reovirus in Dici1, but not Dici3 cells. Partial fragments (900 bp) of the DcRV p8 24 were amplified from the cDNA of Dici1 (P1, GenBank: PP894986), but not Dici3 (P5). ( B ) RT-PCR confirmed the presence of DcACV and DcRV in Dici5 cells. Partial fragments of the DcACV RNA1 (473 bp, GenBank: PP894988) and DcRV p8 (GenBank: PP894987) were amplified from the cDNA of Dici5 (Passage 33). GeneRuler 1 kb plus DNA ladder was used as a DNA marker. + control: cDNA made from purified D. citri viruses. NTC: no template control. Arrows indicate PCR products at the expected sizes. We performed a panel of PCR to determine whether Dici5, a cell line established after Dici1 and Dici3, was infected with Wolbachia or D. citri -associated virus(es). As shown in Figs. 2 A and 3 B, Dici5 was infected with Wolbachia , DcRV, and DcACV. RT-PCR on Dici5 was negative for the detection of DcFLV and DcCLV sequences (data not shown). We assessed whether the Wolbachia levels in Dici1 and Dici5 cells could be reduced by treatment with doxycycline, as shown previously in vivo 28 . As shown in Fig. 2 B,C, doxycycline treatment at either 0.25 or 0.5 µg/mL for 2 weeks appeared to have reduced the levels of Wolbachia in Dici1 and Dici5 cells when compared to the untreated controls. By comparison, the levels of the housekeeping gene β-actin remained consistent in all samples (Supplementary Fig. S9). These results further support the notion that these cells are infected with Wolbachia . We did not observe a significant change in cell morphology or cell division rate (estimated by passaging intervals) between untreated controls and D. citri cells treated with doxycycline (data not shown). The distribution of Wolbachia in Dici1 cells was evaluated by staining with FtsZ antibodies (Fig. 4 ). A punctate staining pattern, primarily in the cytoplasm, was observed in approximately 40% of 85 cells evaluated (Fig. 4 B,C), suggesting that Wolbachia was widely distributed in Dici1 cells. By comparison, no positive signal resulted from the staining of approximately 120 Dici3 cells (Fig. 4 F,G), supporting the conclusion that this cell line is not infected with Wolbachia .

Discussion The motivation for the establishment of continuous D. citri cell lines was to fill an important gap that has curtailed research on D. citri -associated pathogens. We have generated three continuous cell lines derived from D. citri embryos 39 , each of which has been passaged more than 40 times. Dici3 appears to be the most robust of the three lines due to its short passaging interval. Few Wolbachia transcripts were detected in the Dici3 transcriptome. Importantly, no Wolbachia -specific gene fragments were amplified from Dici3 genomic DNA and no Wolbachia FtsZ protein was detected in Dici3 cells by immunohistology. Taken together, these data suggest that Wolbachia is absent from Dici3 cells. Furthermore, Dici3 appears to be free of viral infection. Therefore, of the cell lines generated in this study, Dici3, as a virus- and Wolbachia -free cell line, appears to be best suited for the growth and study of D. citri -associated pathogens such as C Las. As expected, many oocyte marker transcripts were found in the two cell lines (i.e. Dici1 and Dici3) for which transcriptome analysis was conducted. Interestingly, unlike marker genes from other tissues such as gut and hemocyte, most neuronal marker gene transcripts were detected in both transcriptomes with many in high abundance. These results indicate that Dici1 and Dici3 may consist of a large number of neuronal progenitors, which is consistent with the fibroblast-like morphology of many cells in these lines. Dici3 is also comprised of cells with non-fibroblast-like morphology, raising the possibility that sublines containing different types of cells may be generated from this line. The presence of multiple markers with low CPM values, combined with expression of markers such as Notch1, headcase and prospero indicates that Dici1 and Dici3 consist predominantly of non-differentiated or early-stage cells. Expression of elav and vacht for example, which are markers of mature neuronal populations was undetected or detected only at low levels (Table 3 ). It is important to note that Notch1, headcase and prospero are not strict markers for specific cell types, but rather dynamic indicators of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and lineage commitment. Although all three cell lines were generated in a similar manner, the composition of sequences from bacteria and viruses are unique for each cell line. Pathogen infections are dynamic within insect populations with only a subset of individuals typically infected at a given time. This situation is reflected by the presence or absence of pathogens in eggs and the resulting cell lines described herein. In contrast to Dici3, Dici1 and Dici5 cells were infected with Wolbachia . While doxycycline treatment negatively impacted insect fitness levels 28 , no overt effect of doxycycline on the morphology or growth of Dici1 or Dici5 cells was observed during two weeks of treatment. Wolbachia could potentially be eliminated from subcultures of the Dici1 and Dici5 cell lines with prolonged doxycycline treatment for assessment of Wolbachia impacts on D. citri cells and on replication of the viruses present in the respective cell lines. Conversely, a subculture of Dici3 could be infected with Wolbachia as a Wolbachia only treatment, although DcRV may also be present in a Dici1 or Dici5-derived inoculum. The D. citri cell lines described here will be an important asset for study of the six D. citri -associated viruses identified to date and for the production of infectious viral clones for potential use in D. citri management 64 . First, Dici1 and Dici5 have the potential to provide for isolation of DcRV and DcACV separate from other viruses that commonly co-infect D. citri 21 . As these two viruses differ in size, they could potentially be isolated from Dici5 cells by differential centrifugation. Second, Dici3 will allow for the study of replication of individual or mixtures of D. citri viruses in the absence of Wolbachia . Third, the impacts of Wolbachia on D. citri virus replication can be assessed as described above. It is notable that of the three cell lines, Dici3, which is virus- and Wolbachia -free is the most robust with the shortest passaging interval and absence of culture crashes (Table 2 ). Based on maintenance of the Dici1 cell line by three independent researchers at the University of Florida, this was the most difficult line to handle with multiple Dici1 subcultures lost during passaging even though all subcultures of Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5 were maintained in the same manner. Whether these Dici1 crashes occurred due to the replication dynamics of Wolbachia and DcRV in combination with cell type and/or additional stressors remains unknown. In contrast, no subcultures of Dici5, which harbors Wolbachia , DcRV and DcACV have been lost. In summary, we have established three continuous D. citri cell lines thereby providing a valuable resource for research on D. citri- associated pathogens. Future research directions include testing of these cell lines for their ability to support the replication of C Las and of D. citri viruses, and the potential for positive or negative interactions between C Las, viruses, and Wolbachia . Whether the neuron-like characteristics of Dici1 and Dici3 impact the ability of non-neuronal pathogens to replicate is a question of particular interest. In addition to their utility for study of D. citri -associated pathogens, these cell lines may also serve as a platform for studying insecticide mechanisms of action, and psyllid physiology including immunology, development, and signal transduction pathways 65 , 66 – 67 ."
