    "full_text": "Oil glands of citrus peel are known sites for synthesis and deposition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, it is unclear how oil glands and VOCs affect fruit flavor and postharvest disease resistance in vivo. Here, we report characterization of a natural mutant ‘Huapi’ (HP) kumquat ( Fortunella crassifolia Swingle) compared with its wild progenitor ‘Rongan’ (RA). HP fruit decreased in both size and number of oil glands from the onset of fruit development when compared to RA. The total VOCs concentration and the number of individual VOCs in mature HP fruit were lower than that in RA. Limonene, α -pinene and β -myrcene concentrations showed the greatest reduction (30-, 21- and 20-fold). Sensory evaluation showed that flavor of HP fruit was more acceptable to consumers compared to that of RA. Sweeter, less acidic features of HP fruit were likely due to higher soluble sugars content and lower organic acid content, respectively. Changes in HP fruit VOCs likely contribute to its less pungent and better aroma features. HP fruit displayed stronger resistance to the fungal pathogens Penicillium italicum and Geotrichum candidum compared to RA in in vivo inoculation experiments. Transcriptomic analysis and qPCR validation indicated that FcERF096 , FcCHI , FcCXE , FcPi21L1 , FcPi21L2 , FcPIP and FcXYLL potentially involve in enhanced disease resistance of HP fruit. Taken together, these results reveal the potential of oil glands and terpenes in affecting fruit sensory attributes and postharvest disease resistance in planta in kumquat, providing new insights into the technologies improving these important traits in citrus."

          "Secretory structures such as glandular trichomes and oil glands are extracellular spaces allowing the sequestration and storage of secondary metabolites at high concentrations. These secretory structures enable the plant to respond to interactions with the external environment e.g. herbivore attack or pathogen infection, without the need to upregulate metabolite biosynthesis ( Tissier et al., 2017 ). In contrast to glandular trichomes that are exposed outside the epidermis, oil glands are embedded in the epidermis and are constructed of several layers of external sheath cells and epithelial cells, as well as an internal secretory cavity ( Liang et al., 2006, Rodrigues and Machado, 2012 ). Oil glands are found in the leaves of numerous species, such as Eucalyptus polybractea , Dictamnus dasycarpus and Myrtus communis ( Kalachanis and Psaras, 2005, King et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2014 ), and citrus fruit ( Liang et al., 2006 ). The formation of oil glands is generally accepted as a lysigenous process resulting from programmed cell death ( Zhou et al., 2014, Huai et al., 2021 ).",
          "Oil gland is a vital place for housing essential oil ( Liang et al., 2006 ). The oil within its extracellular lumina is comprised of a complex mixture of secondary metabolites including terpenoids, non-terpenoid ester and aldehyde compounds ( Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019 ). Of note, volatile compounds, especially volatile terpenes often dominate these metabolites ( Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019 ), with the composition and content varying between and within different species. For example, the major constituents of the essential oil of cultivars of the evergreen herb thyme ( Thymus vulgaris L.) are thymol (23–60%), γ -terpinene (18–50%) and p -cymene (8–44%) ( Satyal et al., 2016 ), whilst α -pinene, β -pinene and germacrene D compose the essential oil of pine needles ( Ioannou et al., 2014 ). Essential oil composition also varies between different tissues. In rhizomes of the genus Curcuma , the most abundant compounds are typically 1, 8-cineole, camphor and camphene ( Angel et al., 2014 ), and in the dried flower buds of clove the major component essential oils are eugenol, β -caryophyllene and eugenyl acetate ( Razafimamonjison et al., 2014 ). In citrus fruit, D-limonene, α -pinene and myrcene are the main essential oil components ( Guo et al., 2018 ). In addition to their role in storing essential oils, oil glands have also been shown to be the site of volatile terpene biosynthesis, especially monoterpenes. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of oil gland epithelial cells from citrus fruit peels revealed that the main volatile terpenoids (mostly monoterpenes) and non-volatile phenylpropanoids (mainly isopentenyl coumarins and polymethoxyflavonoids) were synthesized in oil gland epithelial cells ( Voo et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, the leucoplasts in the oil gland epithelial cells of peppermint leaves and citrus peel have been demonstrated to be the site of monoterpene synthesis such as D-limonene ( Gleizes et al., 1983, Turner et al., 1999, Zhu et al., 2018 ).",
          "Volatile terpenes often have a distinct aroma, which can be an important dimension of fruit flavor perceived by human consumers ( Bönisch et al., 2014, Feng et al., 2021, Zeng et al., 2020 ). In grapes, monoterpenes are one major class of positive aroma compounds that impart floral and citrus notes to some white wines. For example, the characteristic aroma of Muscat is primarily determined by a combination of just three terpenoid alcohols: geraniol, linalool, and nerol, while the varietal aroma of Riesling requires not only the same terpenes but also α -terpineol, 3 S -citronellol, and 3 S -hotrienol ( Bönisch et al., 2014 ). In kiwifruit, sensory descriptive and discriminant analysis showed that 1,8-cineole contributed a key floral/eucalyptus note to the aroma of ripe ‘Hort16A’ kiwifruit ( Actinidia chinensis ) ( Zeng et al., 2020 ). In citrus, an analysis of volatiles from 108 accessions, showed that all citrus germplasm had similar volatile compounds, with the predominant compounds being D-limonene, α -pinene, and β -myrcene ( Zhang et al., 2017 ), all of which were described to exhibit unique notes, with D-limonene exhibiting a mint, lemon, citrus flavor, while α-pinene a peppery, spicy flavor, and myrcene a harsh, turpentine and minty flavor in FlavorDB ( http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/ffavordb ) ( Garg et al., 2018 ). In addition, using a flavoromics approach, esters and aldehydes were associated with citrusy attributes; while linalool, and citronellol were associated with fruity/floral attributes ( Feng et al., 2021 ). However, the exact contribution of individual terpene compounds to citrus flavor is not clear.",
          "In addition to the function of exhibiting complex aroma, volatile terpenes are also known to have antifungal activities ( Jing et al., 2014, Yu et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021 ). For example, α -terpineol and terpene-4-ol exert antifungal activities in vitro and in vivo against Aspergillus niger in grapes ( An et al., 2019 ), and carvone and linalool showed antifungal activity against A. flavus ( Lasram et al., 2019 ). Extracted citrus volatile essential oils have shown an antifungal effect in vitro, with linalool, citral and γ -terpinene exerting antifungal activity against both Penicillium italicum and P. digitatum , and D-limonene exerting antifungal activity against P. digitatum ( Jing et al., 2014, Tao et al., 2014 ). However, D-limonene content of citrus fruit is negatively correlated with its resistance to P. digitatum in planta in transgenic fruit downregulated for limonene synthase ( Rodríguez et al., 2011 ). Similarly, transgenic downregulation of ( E , E )- α -farnesene, the predominant terpene in apple fruit, was associated with decreased disease initiation rates of three pathogens, Colletotrichum acutatum , P. expansum and Neofabraea alba ( Souleyre et al., 2019 ). The mechanisms by which reduced terpene accumulation increases disease resistance is unclear.",
          "Kumquats ( Fortunella spp.) are a small orange-like fruit with a refreshing flavor that are commonly eaten whole. They are commercially marketed as citrus fruit and are classified into the economically important true citrus fruit tree group of the Rutaceae family ( Wu et al., 2018, Chai et al., 2022 ). In this study, a natural mutant kumquat ‘Huapi’ was compared with its progenitor ‘Rongan’, an important commercial F. crassifolia cultivar grown in the south of China. ‘Huapi’ is a spontaneous seedling mutant of ‘Rongan’ ( Wei et al., 2021 ), which has many attractive features including glossy peel, fewer seeds, and good flavor. Although some aspects of ‘Huapi’ fruit quality have been investigated previously ( Goh et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2021 ), here we present a comprehensive study investigating the relationship between oil gland development and changes in VOC production between the two cultivars. In turn we use sensory analysis, in vivo inoculation experiments with fungal pathogens, and transcriptomic analysis, to reveal how oil glands and VOCs influence the flavor of kumquat fruit and resistance to postharvest diseases. Our results suggest new opportunities for developing new technologies improving these important traits in citrus."

For each stage, 45 fruit were used in total for three replicates, with 15 fruit for each replicate. After snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, samples were stored at − 80 °C for further analysis. VOCs were extracted using the method as follows. Finely ground frozen citrus exocarp (0.25 g) was mixed with 2 mL of aqueous 22% CaCl 2 , followed by addition of 10 mL dichloromethane (DCM) and stirring. The mixture was frozen at − 20 °C overnight. The middle DCM layer was collected and added into a small amount of water-free MgSO 4 , the mixture was then filtered using glass wool. The filtrates were collected and dried under a stream of nitrogen. An aliquot of 0.5 mL DCM ( containing 43.75 μg/mL methyl nonanoate as internal standard) was added to dissolve the sample, which was then filtered through a 0.22 µm pore size Millipore membrane filter prior to GC-MS. VOCs were analyzed by GC-MS on a Shimadzu TQ8050 GC-MS. Splitless injections of 1 μL samples over 30 s were made at 240 °C onto a DB-Wax® capillary column (20 m × 0.18 mm i.d. × 0.18 µm film thickness, Agilent) with a He flow of 15 μL s −1 .

            "paragraphs": [
              "The exocarp of citrus fruit are rich in oil glands that are critical sites for deposition of essential oils. Occasionally, plants with fruit exhibiting abnormal oil glands are produced by spontaneous mutations. In this study, fruit of ‘Rongan’ (RA) kumquat ( Fig. 1 A) and its natural seedling mutant ‘Huapi’ (HP) ( Fig. 1 B) were compared for oil gland development. The morphology was first analyzed using fruit at the fully mature (FM) stage. Fewer and smaller oil glands were unevenly distributed in the exocarp of HP fruit when compared to that in RA ( Fig. 1 C–G). On average 2366 oil glands per fruit were formed in RA kumquat, which was 5.3 times higher than that in HP kumquat (446) ( Fig. 1 H). Furthermore, the average diameter size of oil glands in RA kumquat is 1.26 mm, which was 2.5x that observed in HP (0.50 mm) ( Fig. 1 I). The effect of these differences in oil gland number and morphology on the thickness of exocarp in kumquat fruit was then investigated. Exocarp thickness was 0.32 mm in mutant HP kumquat, which was only approximately 1/6 of that in RA kumquat (1.88 mm) ( Fig. 1 J).",
              "To understand whether abnormal oil glands are produced at the onset of fruit development or later in fruit development, optical microscopy was used to examine the morphology of oil glands at four different fruit developmental stages ( Fig. S1A ). Results showed that there were round oil glands in both RA and mutant HP fruit from the earliest developmental stage of IM1 ( Fig. S1B ). However, oil glands of HP were sparsely and unevenly distributed in the peel at all four stages, whilst in RA oil glands were densely distributed throughout fruit development ( Fig. S1B ). Oil gland size of HP kumquat increased throughout fruit development, from an average diameter of 0.09 mm at the IM1 stage to 0.20 mm at MG stage ( Fig. S1C ). However, the size of oil glands in HP kumquat was smaller than that of RA from an early stage, with the average diameter being 68.4% and 33.0% of that in RA kumquat at IM1 stage (0.14 mm) and MG stage (0.60 mm), respectively ( Fig. S1C ). These data indicate that oil glands in HP show a slower expansion rate than those of RA kumquat during fruit development. To examine the ultrastructure of oil glands, SEM was used to examine oil glands at the MG stage in RA and HP. In RA fruit, secretory cavities were intact，large and clearly visible inside in the oil glands, whilst in HP the oil glands were smaller and without secretory cavities inside ( Fig. S1D )."

              "To test if the presence of abnormal oil glands affected volatile accumulation, the VOC profiles of RA and HP fruit at IM1, IM3 and FM stage were examined by GC-MS. Thirty VOCs were identified in HP kumquat, which was seven less than in RA ( Table S2 ). The number of volatiles identified in HP fruit gradually increased as the fruit developed, with fifteen, nineteen and twenty-nine VOCs identified in HP fruit at the IM1, IM3 and FM stages, respectively. In RA fruit more VOCs were identified (38, 37 and 36, at the IM1, IM3 and FM stages, respectively; Table S2 ), but the number of VOCs did not change as the fruit developed.",
              "Total VOC content increased throughout fruit development in HP fruit, with total concentrations being 10.8, 33.8 and 91.5 mg kg −1 at IM1, IM3 and FM stage, respectively ( Table S2 ). VOC content in RA fruit also increased during development, and total VOC concentrations were higher than HP kumquat at all developmental stages (337.7, 333.69 and 2336.4 mg kg −1 at IM1, IM3 and FM stages, respectively; Table S2 ). To determine the dominant components that resulted in VOC variation between HP and RA kumquat, a PCA analysis of VOC profiles was performed. HP and RA were clearly separated in the PCA plot ( Fig. 2 A). PC1 (F1), explaining 56.3% of the variation, separated immature HP kumquat from immature RA (IM1 and IM3), while PC2 (F2), explaining an additional 26.6% of the variation, separated fully mature HP kumquat from fully mature RA kumquat ( Fig. 2 A).",
              "Compounds with factor values > 0.90 were selected as the main components for both PC1 and PC2. As a result, seventeen main components separating immature HP kumquat from immature RA kumquat were defined, including ten sesquiterpenes, five monoterpene derivatives and two sesquiterpene derivatives ( Table S3 ). Among them, germacrene D was present at the highest concentrations, followed by germacrene B, δ -elemene and bicyclogermacrene ( Table S2 , Fig. S2 ). The amount of germacrene D increased from 1.7 mg kg −1 (IM1) to 4.2 mg kg −1 (FM) as HP kumquat developed, whilst it decreased from 17.1 mg kg −1 (IM1) to 8.4 mg kg −1 (FM) in RA ( Table S2 , Fig. S2 ).",
              "Seven main compounds separated fully mature HP kumquat from fully mature RA, with all seven being monoterpenes: limonene, β -myrcene, α -pinene, sabinene, β -phellandrene, α -terpinolene, and camphene ( Table S3 ). Limonene was the most abundant compound in both cultivars, with concentrations of 4.2, 24.6 and 75.0 mg kg −1 in HP kumquat at IM1, IM3 and FM stage, respectively, accounting for 38.4%, 72.7% and 82.0% of total VOCs ( Fig. 2 B; Table S2 ). Of note, higher limonene content was observed in RA kumquat, with concentrations of 265.7, 281.6, and 2271.2 mg kg −1 at IM1, IM3 and FM stage, respectively, accounting for 78.7%, 84.4% and 97.2% of total VOCs ( Fig. 2 B; Table S2 ). Besides, β -myrcene, α -pinene and camphene were present at 20-, 21- and 3-fold lower concentrations in fully mature HP kumquat compared to RA, respectively ( Fig. 2 B; Table S2 ). Sabinene, β -phellandrene and α -terpinolene were not detected in HP kumquat, but were detected at 1.8, 3.8 and 0.2 mg kg −1 in fully mature RA kumquat, respectively ( Fig. 2 B; Table S2 )."

              "Flavor is perceived as a combination of taste and aroma, thus it is an essential factor affecting consumer preference of fruit. A sensory panel analysis was used to evaluate the difference in consumer acceptability between mature fruit of RA and mutant HP kumquat based on five sensory attributes (sweetness, aroma, pungency, sourness and overall acceptability). First, the acceptability of flavor of whole kumquat fruit was evaluated, with the panelists scoring samples from 0 (the lowest acceptance) to 100 (the highest acceptance). Results showed that scores for all five indices were higher in mutant HP kumquat than in RA ( Fig. 3 A). The acceptability score of sweetness was 78.1 in HP kumquat, which was 26.4 points higher than in RA. The acceptability of aroma was 61.4 in HP kumquat, which was 17.5 points higher than in RA. In addition, as negative flavor indices, acceptability of pungency and sourness was 76.1 and 86.9 points respectively in HP kumquat, which was 25.2 and 19.2 points higher than in RA respectively. The overall consumer acceptability of mutant HP kumquat was 78.7, which was 26.3 points higher than in RA kumquat.",
              "As the peel of kumquat is edible, the respective contribution of peel and pulp to fruit flavor and consumer acceptability was explored by presenting sensory panelists with individual peel and pulp samples to taste. The mean acceptability score of sweetness was 77.3 in the pulp of HP kumquat, which was similar to that of the whole fruit, but higher than the score of 64.3 for peel ( Fig. 3 B). In RA kumquat, mean acceptability of sweetness was 48.0 in pulp, similar to that in whole fruit, but a lower score of 37.3 was measured in its peel compared with that of whole fruit ( Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that consumer perception of sweetness in whole fruit of both cultivars is mainly from the pulp, and less from the peel. The mean acceptability score of aroma was 55.1 in the pulp of HP kumquat, similar to that in whole fruit, but a lower score of 48.7 were measured in its peel compared with whole fruit (61.4), indicating that acceptability of aroma in HP fruit was mainly contributed by pulp ( Fig. 3 C). However, the mean acceptability score of aroma in the pulp and peel of RA were both similar to that of whole fruit ( Fig. 3 C). The mean acceptability score for pungency was 87.3 in pulp of mutant HP kumquat, which was higher than that in whole fruit (76.1) ( Fig. 3 D). Acceptability of pungency for peel of HP showed no significant difference with that of whole fruit (67.3). In RA, similar trends were observed. Mean acceptability of pungency was 70.6 in pulp, which was higher than that in whole fruit (50.9) and peel (42.9), with the score in whole fruit and peel showing no significant difference ( Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that it is peel that mainly contributes to acceptability of pungency in both mutant HP kumquat and RA. Mean acceptability for sourness in both pulp (87.9) and peel (80.0) of HP kumquat showed no significant difference to that in whole fruit (86.9), indicating that sourness of whole HP might be contributed by both pulp and peel ( Fig. 3 E). In RA, mean acceptability of sourness scores showed similar trends (70.4 in pulp, 67.7 in whole fruit and 64.6 in peel).",
              "Mean overall acceptance in HP kumquat had a score of 81.1, which was similar to that in whole fruit (78.7) and higher than that in peel (69.1) ( Fig. 3 F). In RA, the mean score of overall acceptance of whole fruit (52.4) showed no significant difference to both pulp (54.1) and peel (48.7) ( Fig. 3 F). These results indicate that overall acceptance is mainly driven by pulp for HP kumquat, but both pulp and peel contribute to overall acceptance for RA kumquat. Another independent replicate was conducted for these evaluations with similar results ( Fig. S3 ).",
              "Sugar and organic acid contents are likely to contribute to flavor acceptability scores measured in the sensory panel evaluation. Therefore, total soluble solids (TSS) and titratable acidity (TA) were measured in whole fruit samples from HP and RA. Results showed that TSS of HP kumquat was 19.3%, which was higher than 12.3% in RA ( Fig. 3 G). HP fruit had a lower TA of 0.47% compared with that of 0.61% in RA ( Fig. 3 H). The major sugar components were then measured in both pulp and peel. Results showed that sucrose and fructose were the most abundant in both pulp and peel of kumquat, followed by glucose. The concentration of sucrose was 136.0 g kg −1 and 87.5 g kg −1 in the pulp and peel of HP, respectively, which was 1.9- and 1.4-fold higher than that in the pulp and peel of RA (72.5 g kg −1 and 61.7 g kg −1 ), respectively ( Fig. 3 I-J). Fructose content was 141.6 g kg −1 and 95.8 g kg −1 in the pulp and peel of HP, respectively, higher than that in the corresponding tissue of RA (68.6 g kg −1 and 63.2 g kg −1 ) as well ( Fig. 3 I-J). Glucose content were also higher in the pulp of HP kumquat (38.0 g kg −1 ) than in RA (31.1 g kg −1 ), but lower in the peel of HP kumquat (19.7 g kg −1 ) than in RA (32.6 g kg −1 ) ( Fig. 3 I–J).",
              "For organic acids, no significant differences were observed between HP and RA kumquat for malic acid, the most abundant organic acid in pulp ( Fig. 3 K–L). However, citric acid content was lower (∼ 70% decrease) in HP kumquat than in RA, especially in pulp ( Fig. 3 K). Citric acid content was also 30% lower in peel of HP (1.5 g kg −1 ) than in RA (2.2 g kg −1 ) ( Fig. 3 L). Quinic acid was the most abundant organic acid in peel and was higher in HP kumquat than in RA ( Fig. 3 K–L)."

              "To understand if the presence of abnormal oil glands and changes in VOC production affected infection of citrus fruit by postharvest pathogens, RA and HP fruit were challenged with P. italicum and G. candidum , two of the most serious postharvest fungal pathogens in citrus. After inoculation with P. italicum , water-soaked lesions were clearly observed by 24 h after inoculation with 1.0 × 10 6 CFU mL −1 P. italicum in RA fruit ( Fig. 4 A). After 48 h, disease lesions with ∼7.0 mm diameter were observed on RA fruit ( Fig. 4 A), whereas smaller sized (∼4.0 mm) lesions occurred on HP fruit ( Fig. 4 B). The greater resistance of HP fruit to P. italicum infection continued throughout the infection period ( Fig. 4 C). By 96 h post inoculation, disease lesions in HP fruit were only ∼60% of the size of lesions in RA fruit. The disease lesions were inhibited in HP fruit compared with RA fruit, however, the disease incidences of RA and HP fruit were identical after inoculating with P. italicum at each parallel period ( Table S4 ). Results showed that disease incidence was 10% by 24 h and 36 h after inoculation for both HP and RA fruit, and sharply increased to 100% by 48 h after inoculation.",
              "To investigate the relationships between disease resistance and oil gland development as well as VOC biosynthesis, total VOC content was firstly calculated for HP and RA kumquat at 0 d and 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after inoculation with P. italicum . Results showed that total VOC content increased in HP kumquat at 48 h and 72 h after inoculation, then return to pre-infection level at 96 h after inoculation ( Fig. 4 D). However, total VOC content continued to decline in RA kumquat from 48 h after inoculation ( Fig. 4 D). The correlation between lesion diameter and oil gland size as well as total VOC content were then calculated by integrating data of HP and RA kumquat 48 h after inoculation . Results showed that after P. italicum invasion, lesion diameter displayed a strongly positive correlation with both oil gland diameter (r = 0.701, P = 0.001) and total VOC content of kumquat fruit (r = 0.852, P = 0.031) ( Fig. 4 E-F). Additionally, an extra verification of correlation between lesion diameter and total VOC content was conducted using data at 96 h after inoculation, a strongly positive correlation was also showed in the results, with r = 0.879, P = 0.021( Fig. 4 G).",
              "At 24 h after inoculation with 1.0 × 10 6 CFU mL −1 G. candidum , slight water-soaked lesions appeared on both HP kumquat and RA fruit ( Fig. S4A –B). Stronger resistance to G. candidum infection in HP fruit was observed as early as 36 h after inoculation. At this time, disease lesions were ∼8.0 mm in diameter in RA fruit, but smaller size (∼1.0 mm) in HP ( Fig. S4C ). Resistance of HP fruit to G. candidum continued through the time course ( Fig. S4C ). By 96 h post-inoculation, disease lesions in HP fruit were ∼65% of the size of lesions in RA fruit. In addition, disease incidence of RA fruit increased faster than HP fruit after inoculating with G. candidum ( Table S4 ). It took only 12 h for RA fruit to get the disease incidence rising from 20% (24 h after inoculation) to 100% (36 h after inoculation), but a longer 36 h was taken for HP fruit.",
              "The relationships between disease resistance and oil gland development as well as VOC biosynthesis were also verified for G. candidum invasion. Total VOC content in HP kumquat showed an sharp increase at 48 h after inoculation, then returned to pre-infection levels from 72 h after inoculation ( Fig. S4D ). However, total VOC content in RA kumquat was unchanged at 48 h after inoculation, then decreased from 72 h after inoculation ( Fig. S4D ). Results of correlation analysis showed that after G. candidum invasion, lesion diameter displayed a strongly positive correlation with both oil gland diameter (r = 0.786, P < 0.001) and total VOC content of kumquat fruit (r = 0.983, P < 0.001) ( Fig. S4E -F).

              "To identify genes potentially associated with stronger resistance of HP kumquat to fungal infection, fruit peel of HP and RA at 0 d and 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum were subjected to RNA-seq. Treatment group consisted of three biological replicates for each cultivar. In total, more than 6.54 Gb of clean reads were generated for each sample. Of the clean reads, the percentage of bases with a quality value greater than 30 (Q30) was over 94.64%. Among all the libraries, the average ratios of the clean reads uniquely mapped to the reference genome ranged from 93.15% to 94.08%. These results indicated that the quality of the sequencing results was acceptable ( Table S5 ). Pearson correlation analysis of total expression profiles revealed that there was a high correlation within each group, supporting the reliability of the biological replicates ( Fig. 5 A). PCA revealed that HP had distinct expression profiles vs. those of RA, both before and after inoculation ( Fig. 5 B). Differential expression analysis in HP between the 0 d vs 48 h samples revealed 2429 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 1181 (48.6%) were upregulated ( Fig. S5A ). For RA, 3402 DEGs were identified between 0 d vs 48 h, of which 1973 were upregulated. GO analysis was then performed to determine the functional distribution of the DEGs. Fig. S5B shows the distribution of DEGs when placed into the three GO categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. The primary changes in these three categories were similar in both HP and RA kumquat when comparing 0 d vs 48 h samples. For the biological process category, the GO terms enriched with DEGs included ‘cellular process’ and ‘metabolic process’. In the cellular component category, the top two subcategories were ‘cell part’ and ‘membrane part’. For molecular function, the top two subcategories were ‘catalytic activity’ and ‘binding’.",
              "Go enrichment analysis of DEGs in the biological process category associated with defense response were then analyzed in more detail. The scatterplots in Fig. 5 C and Fig. S5C illustrated that DEGs were enriched in many functional pathways. A total of 138 defense related DEGs between 0 d and 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum were identified. Of these, 31 DEGs were identified specifically in HP kumquat ( Table S6 ), 75 DEGs specifically in RA ( Table S7 ), and 32 DEGs in both of HP and RA ( Fig. 5 D). Thirty-one defense response genes which were specific to HP might contribute to the stronger resistance of this cultivar to fungal infection. Among them, eleven genes were upregulated in HP after inoculation ( Fig. 5 E), including chitinase (CHI, sjg016680), carboxylesterase (CXE, sjg236800), Pyricularia oryzae resistance 21-like protein (Pi21L1, sjg122860; Pi21L2, sjg123990), proline iminopeptidase (PIP, sjg146880), D-xylose-proton symporter-like (XYLL, sjg249100), ERF transcription factors (ERF096, sjg198000; ERF, sjg215290), enhanced disease resistance 4 like-protein (EDR4, sjg238140), thaumatin-like protein (TLP, sjg189580) and disease resistance protein ( DRL, sjg094820)."

The results were generally consistent with the RNA-seq, with all the nine defense response genes upregulated in HP kumquat 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum ( Fig. 6 ). Of note, at 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum , the expression levels of FcERF096 , FcCHI , FcCXE , FcPi21L1 , FcPi21L2 , FcPIP and FcXYLL in HP kumquat were significantly higher than that in RA kumquat， indicating that these genes might involve in the enhanced disease resistance of HP kumquat ( Fig. 6 ). Among these genes, the expression of FcERF096 was increased to the highest by up to about 30 folds in HP kumquat 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum , suggesting the initiation of ethylene-mediated Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR). Therefore, the expression level of the ISR marker gene FcPDF1.2 was further analyzed. Result showed that FcPDF1.2 gene expression was significantly higher in HP kumquat both before and after P. italicum invasion than that in RA kumquat ( Fig. 6 ), indicating that ethylene-mediated ISR might involve in the enhanced disease resistance of HP kumquat.",
              "According to the VOC profiles of RA and HP fruit, limonene and germacrene D were respectively the most abundant monoterpene and sesquiterpene in both cultivars, and at FM stage, the concentration of limonene and germacrene D in RA fruit were significantly higher than that in HP fruit. In order to analyze the relationship between VOCs and their impact on disease resistance, we further analyzed the expression levels of limonene synthase gene ( FcLS ) and germacrene D synthase gene ( FcGER ). The results revealed that the expression level of FcLS was significantly lower in HP kumquat than in RA kumquat both before and after P. italicum invasion, whereas the expression level of FcGER was significantly lower in HP kumquat than in RA kumquat only before P. italicum invasion. Moreover, FcLS gene was downregulated in RA kumquat but upregulated in HP kumquat after P. italicum invasion, whereas FcGER gene was only downregulated in RA kumquat after P. italicum invasion ( Fig. 6 )."

          "Oil glands are closely associated with the synthesis and accumulation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially volatile terpenes in citrus fruit ( Liang et al., 2006, Voo et al., 2012, Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019 ). In this study, we undertook a comprehensive analysis to compare oil gland development and VOCs accumulation in a natural mutant kumquat variety ‘Huapi’ and its wild type progenitor ‘Rongan’. Smaller and lower number of oil glands were showed in HP kumquat in comparison with RA kumquat of the parallel stages, accompanied by lower content of VOCs but similar VOC components. These results were in consistence with the previous studies that proving oil glands’ function in the VOCs accumulation and metabolism ( Liang et al., 2006, Voo et al., 2012, Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019 ), and further demonstrated that the difference in oil gland morphology between the two varieties mainly affected the VOC content rather than the composition. Our results indicated that oil glands are present in both RA and mutant HP fruit from the earliest developmental stage. However, oil glands of HP kumquat were sparsely and unevenly distributed in the peel at all developmental stages, whilst in RA kumquat oil glands were densely distributed throughout the fruit development. This result suggested that any changes in VOCs accumulation in HP kumquat resulting from the difference in oil glands were likely to be quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. This hypothesis was supported initially by VOC analysis, which indicated that the sparsely distributed small oil glands in HP fruit supported lower essential oil accumulation throughout development. The main components separating HP kumquat from RA were defined, with most being monoterpenes at the FM stage and sesquiterpenes at IM stages (IM1 and IM3). In nearly all cases the separation was driven by lower accumulation of the compounds in HP vs RA fruit. The differences in VOC accumulation between HP and RA indicates that fruit metabolism was likely to be disturbed by the presence of abnormal oil glands.",
          "Sensory panel analysis was used to evaluate the difference in consumer acceptability between fully mature fruit of RA and mutant HP kumquat. Phenotypic data for VOCs, sugars and organic acids was collected for the same samples, allowing a direct and powerful comparison of the two datasets. Mean acceptability scores for sweetness, aroma, pungency, sourness and overall acceptance of mutant HP kumquat were all higher than for RA. In HP, the higher mean sweetness acceptability likely due to the higher TSS and concentrations of sucrose and fructose (since glucose was lower in the peel of HP kumquat). The higher mean sourness acceptability score is likely related to the lower TA and reduced citric acid content (since malic acid did not change between the two cultivars). In addition, the mean aroma acceptability scores in HP were higher than in RA. GC-MS analysis indicated that concentrations of most monoterpenes were greatly reduced in HP compared to RA. This suggests that monoterpenes, despite their high concentration in RA fruit, might not contribute strongly to fruit aroma. Our results are supported by a previous study in transgenic orange showing that a 50-fold decrease in D-limonene concentrations was neutral for odor perception ( Rodríguez et al., 2017 ). The increased aroma acceptability in HP fruit might instead be due to unmasking of pleasant smelling sesquiterpenes and other compounds.",
          "Mean pungency acceptability scores were higher in HP. As pungency is ‘the unpleasant perception of irritation in the mouth’, it could be made up of a variety of negative flavor notes. The reduction in some monoterpene components may contribute to this difference. Of note, myrcene is peppery and spicy, which were negative flavor descriptors ( http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/ffavordb ). Other terpenes reduced in HP fruit also have a number of negative flavor descriptors. α -pinene to be harsh and minty; and camphene to be woody, herbal, and camphor ( http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/ffavordb ). Lower levels of these monoterpenes of negative flavor notes in HP fruit may decrease the perceived pungency recorded by panelists. Overall, the strong increase in mean acceptability for whole HP fruit will almost certainly be driven by a combination of all the sensory attributes measured.",
          "To understand if the presence of abnormal oil glands and reduced VOC content affected infection by postharvest pathogens, RA and HP kumquat fruit were challenged with two common fungal pathogens infecting citrus fruit during postharvest. Our results indicated that the presence of abnormal developed oil glands and reduced VOC accumulation in mature HP kumquat was positively correlated with enhanced resistance to both P. italicum and G. candidum in planta. For P. italicum infection, the lower expression level of limonene synthase gene ( FcLS ) in HP kumquat both before and after P. italicum invasion further implied the negative role of limonene in enhanced resistance of HP kumquat to P. italicum. This result does not fit with the dogma that essential oils in citrus are required for pathogen defense, based on many previous studies showing that essential oils and the terpene compounds within them demonstrate antifungal activity when tested via in vitro methods ( Jing et al., 2014, Tao et al., 2014 ). However, our results are consistent with previous studies in transgenic orange, which showed that downregulation of a D-limonene synthase gene reduced D-limonene (the predominant terpene in orange peel) accumulation in orange fruit and led to enhanced resistance of the fruit to the fungal pathogen P. digitatum ( Rodríguez et al., 2011 ). Similarly in apple, downregulation of the ( E , E )-α-farnesene synthase gene reduced the accumulation of ( E , E )-α-farnesene (the predominant terpene in apple skin) in transgenic apple fruit which was associated with decreased disease initiation rates for three pathogens, Colletotrichum acutatum , P. expansum and Neofabraea alba ( Souleyre et al., 2019 ). The mechanism by which a reduction in terpene accumulation increases disease resistance is unclear. Rodríguez et al. (2014) performed a global gene expression analysis of limonene-synthase downregulated versus empty vector control transgenic fruit and showed that reducing D-limonene content upregulated genes involved in the innate immune response. Basal levels of jasmonic acid were higher in the controls compared with limonene-synthase downregulated oranges. Upon fungal challenge, jasmonic acid metabolism and signaling drastically increased in the limonene-synthase downregulated oranges. Souleyre et al. (2019) also suggested that upregulation of genes involved in defense responses might be occurring in apples when ( E , E )-α-farnesene levels were reduced. However, which genes related to defense response that were involved was not described.",
          "According to transcriptome and qRT-PCR data, six defense response genes (including FcCHI , FcCXE , FcPi21L1 , FcPi21L2 , FcPIP and FcXYLL ) were upregulated in HP kumquat and their expression levels were significantly higher than that in RA kumquat at 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum , indicating that transcriptional regulation is likely to be at least one of the multiple mechanisms for regulating fungal resistance in HP kumquat. Among the six defense response genes, chitinases (CHI) could degrade the fungal cell wall chitin ( Malik, 2019 ) and have been reported to exhibit resistance against postharvest fungal pathogens in transgenic lemon fruit ( Oliveri et al., 2015 ). Carboxylesterases (CXE) have been shown to break down the outer layer of the fungal cell wall and have been reported to exhibit antifungal activity in plants such as pepper and lemon fruit ( Seo et al., 2018 ). Pyricularia oryzae resistance 21 protein (Pi21) is a proline-rich protein and deletion in its proline-rich motif confers durable Pyricularia oryzae resistance in rice ( Fukuoka et al., 2009, Fukuoka and Okuno, 2019 ). Proline iminopeptidase (PIP) is an exopeptidase that specifically removes proline from the N-terminus of peptides or proteins ( Dong et al., 2022 ), which might result in proline accumulation. Proline accumulation was usually linked to abiotic stress. One recent study revealed that the accumulation of L-proline and the expression of proline iminopeptidase gene increased in both fls2 and robed/f double mutants under salt conditions ( Yu et al., 2023 ). There were few direct studies on PIP and XYLL (D-xylose-proton symporter-like) involving in disease resistance. However, a previous study revealed that L-proline and D-xylose were significantly elevated as potential biocontrol in stress-tolerant Tricho-fusants interacting with phytopathogen Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc ( Hirpara, Gajera, 2023 ). Transcription factors are also reported to be critical in regulation of plant fungal defense resistance, especially ERFs ( Thirugnanasambantham et al., 2015, Li et al., 2020 ). AaORA , an AP2/ERF transcription factor from Artemisia annua , was reported to be a positive regulator in disease resistance to Botrytis cinerea and to induce expression of genes including BASIC CHITINASE ( Lu et al., 2013 ). In this study, the expression of FcERF096 , FcPDF1.2 (ISR marker gene) and FcCHI (encodes chitinase) were significantly higher in HP kumquat after P. italicum invasion than that in RA kumquat, suggesting the initiation of ethylene-mediated Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR) and they may be members of a network in which ERF regulates the enhancement of disease resistance in HP kumquat. The fungal resistance mechanism underlying in the genes mentioned above of HP kumquat need to further characterize."

          "In conclusion, this study revealed superior sensory attributes and better fungal disease resistance of mutant HP kumquat compared with its progenitor RA kumquat. All of the detected sensory attributes, containing sweetness, aroma, pungency, sourness and overall acceptability, were of greater acceptability in HP kumquat. Moreover, lesion diameter of HP kumquat infected with P. italicum or G. candidum was smaller than that of RA kumquat. Oil gland size and VOCs content showed strongly negative correlation with disease resistance. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that FcERF096 , FcCHI , FcCXE , FcPi21L1 , FcPi21L2 , FcPIP and FcXYLL potentially involve in the enhanced disease resistance of HP fruit. Our results indicate that mutant HP kumquat with abnormal oil glands has superior sensory attributes and better fungal disease resistance than its progenitor RA kumquat, which were contributed at least in part to its abnormal oil glands and less VOCs content. Therefore, RA and HP kumquat has potential to be a pair of good materials for creating new technologies for improving fruit quality and agronomic traits."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Secretory structures such as glandular trichomes and oil glands are extracellular spaces allowing the sequestration and storage of secondary metabolites at high concentrations. These secretory structures enable the plant to respond to interactions with the external environment e.g. herbivore attack or pathogen infection, without the need to upregulate metabolite biosynthesis ( Tissier et al., 2017 ). In contrast to glandular trichomes that are exposed outside the epidermis, oil glands are embedded in the epidermis and are constructed of several layers of external sheath cells and epithelial cells, as well as an internal secretory cavity ( Liang et al., 2006, Rodrigues and Machado, 2012 ). Oil glands are found in the leaves of numerous species, such as Eucalyptus polybractea , Dictamnus dasycarpus and Myrtus communis ( Kalachanis and Psaras, 2005, King et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2014 ), and citrus fruit ( Liang et al., 2006 ). The formation of oil glands is generally accepted as a lysigenous process resulting from programmed cell death ( Zhou et al., 2014, Huai et al., 2021 ). Oil gland is a vital place for housing essential oil ( Liang et al., 2006 ). The oil within its extracellular lumina is comprised of a complex mixture of secondary metabolites including terpenoids, non-terpenoid ester and aldehyde compounds ( Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019 ). Of note, volatile compounds, especially volatile terpenes often dominate these metabolites ( Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019 ), with the composition and content varying between and within different species. For example, the major constituents of the essential oil of cultivars of the evergreen herb thyme ( Thymus vulgaris L.) are thymol (23–60%), γ -terpinene (18–50%) and p -cymene (8–44%) ( Satyal et al., 2016 ), whilst α -pinene, β -pinene and germacrene D compose the essential oil of pine needles ( Ioannou et al., 2014 ). Essential oil composition also varies between different tissues. In rhizomes of the genus Curcuma , the most abundant compounds are typically 1, 8-cineole, camphor and camphene ( Angel et al., 2014 ), and in the dried flower buds of clove the major component essential oils are eugenol, β -caryophyllene and eugenyl acetate ( Razafimamonjison et al., 2014 ). In citrus fruit, D-limonene, α -pinene and myrcene are the main essential oil components ( Guo et al., 2018 ). In addition to their role in storing essential oils, oil glands have also been shown to be the site of volatile terpene biosynthesis, especially monoterpenes. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of oil gland epithelial cells from citrus fruit peels revealed that the main volatile terpenoids (mostly monoterpenes) and non-volatile phenylpropanoids (mainly isopentenyl coumarins and polymethoxyflavonoids) were synthesized in oil gland epithelial cells ( Voo et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, the leucoplasts in the oil gland epithelial cells of peppermint leaves and citrus peel have been demonstrated to be the site of monoterpene synthesis such as D-limonene ( Gleizes et al., 1983, Turner et al., 1999, Zhu et al., 2018 ). Volatile terpenes often have a distinct aroma, which can be an important dimension of fruit flavor perceived by human consumers ( Bönisch et al., 2014, Feng et al., 2021, Zeng et al., 2020 ). In grapes, monoterpenes are one major class of positive aroma compounds that impart floral and citrus notes to some white wines. For example, the characteristic aroma of Muscat is primarily determined by a combination of just three terpenoid alcohols: geraniol, linalool, and nerol, while the varietal aroma of Riesling requires not only the same terpenes but also α -terpineol, 3 S -citronellol, and 3 S -hotrienol ( Bönisch et al., 2014 ). In kiwifruit, sensory descriptive and discriminant analysis showed that 1,8-cineole contributed a key floral/eucalyptus note to the aroma of ripe ‘Hort16A’ kiwifruit ( Actinidia chinensis ) ( Zeng et al., 2020 ). In citrus, an analysis of volatiles from 108 accessions, showed that all citrus germplasm had similar volatile compounds, with the predominant compounds being D-limonene, α -pinene, and β -myrcene ( Zhang et al., 2017 ), all of which were described to exhibit unique notes, with D-limonene exhibiting a mint, lemon, citrus flavor, while α-pinene a peppery, spicy flavor, and myrcene a harsh, turpentine and minty flavor in FlavorDB ( http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/ffavordb ) ( Garg et al., 2018 ). In addition, using a flavoromics approach, esters and aldehydes were associated with citrusy attributes; while linalool, and citronellol were associated with fruity/floral attributes ( Feng et al., 2021 ). However, the exact contribution of individual terpene compounds to citrus flavor is not clear. In addition to the function of exhibiting complex aroma, volatile terpenes are also known to have antifungal activities ( Jing et al., 2014, Yu et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021 ). For example, α -terpineol and terpene-4-ol exert antifungal activities in vitro and in vivo against Aspergillus niger in grapes ( An et al., 2019 ), and carvone and linalool showed antifungal activity against A. flavus ( Lasram et al., 2019 ). Extracted citrus volatile essential oils have shown an antifungal effect in vitro, with linalool, citral and γ -terpinene exerting antifungal activity against both Penicillium italicum and P. digitatum , and D-limonene exerting antifungal activity against P. digitatum ( Jing et al., 2014, Tao et al., 2014 ). However, D-limonene content of citrus fruit is negatively correlated with its resistance to P. digitatum in planta in transgenic fruit downregulated for limonene synthase ( Rodríguez et al., 2011 ). Similarly, transgenic downregulation of ( E , E )- α -farnesene, the predominant terpene in apple fruit, was associated with decreased disease initiation rates of three pathogens, Colletotrichum acutatum , P. expansum and Neofabraea alba ( Souleyre et al., 2019 ). The mechanisms by which reduced terpene accumulation increases disease resistance is unclear. Kumquats ( Fortunella spp.) are a small orange-like fruit with a refreshing flavor that are commonly eaten whole. They are commercially marketed as citrus fruit and are classified into the economically important true citrus fruit tree group of the Rutaceae family ( Wu et al., 2018, Chai et al., 2022 ). In this study, a natural mutant kumquat ‘Huapi’ was compared with its progenitor ‘Rongan’, an important commercial F. crassifolia cultivar grown in the south of China. ‘Huapi’ is a spontaneous seedling mutant of ‘Rongan’ ( Wei et al., 2021 ), which has many attractive features including glossy peel, fewer seeds, and good flavor. Although some aspects of ‘Huapi’ fruit quality have been investigated previously ( Goh et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2021 ), here we present a comprehensive study investigating the relationship between oil gland development and changes in VOC production between the two cultivars. In turn we use sensory analysis, in vivo inoculation experiments with fungal pathogens, and transcriptomic analysis, to reveal how oil glands and VOCs influence the flavor of kumquat fruit and resistance to postharvest diseases. Our results suggest new opportunities for developing new technologies improving these important traits in citrus. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant material Fruit of RA and mutant HP kumquat were harvested at orchards located at Guilin County, Guangxi Province, China. Fruit were collected at five developmental stages after careful selection: (1) IM1 (15 d after flowering; 15 DAF), when fruit had just started to enlarge and had a lateral diameter of 0.4–0.6 cm; (2) IM2 (40 DAF), rapid fruit enlargement with a lateral diameter of 1.1–1.3 cm; (3) IM3 (70–80 DAF), rapid fruit enlargement with a lateral diameter of 1.8–2.0 cm; (4) MG (100–120 DAF), fruit enlargement slowing, a lateral diameter of 2.8–3.2 cm; (5) FM (220 DAF), fully mature fruit at their largest size with orange color in the whole exocarp. Fruit were selected with uniform shape and size and without any mechanical damage or disease at each stage. Fruit were used for oil gland observation, metabolite analysis and fungi inoculation, respectively. The number of fruit used for different experiments was described separately in the corresponding method sections. 2.2 Comparison of oil gland number, size and morphology between RA and HP kumquat Thirty fruit were selected randomly for RA and HP kumquat at FM stage, respectively, for counting oil gland number. For RA kumquat, one quarter of the pericarp of each fruit was photographed by camera, oil gland number of each photo was then counted by ImageJ. The counted oil gland number was then multiplied by four to get oil gland number of a whole RA kumquat fruit. For HP kumquat, the pericarp of whole fruit was photographed by camera, the counted oil gland number of each photo by ImageJ was oil gland number for a whole HP kumquat fruit. For measuring oil gland size (diameter), six fruit were randomly selected for both RA kumquat and HP kumquat at each stage (IM1, IM2, IM3, MG, FM). Pericarp fractions from four randomly selected regions of each fruit were photographed using an optical microscope. Ten oil glands of each fruit at each stage were randomly selected for oil gland size determination. The size of each oil gland was determined by taking an average of transverse diameter and vertical diameter using ImageJ. Exocarp samples of RA and HP kumquat at MG and FM stage for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were prepared by cutting pieces of ∼ 2 mm × 2 mm from the equatorial zone and putting them immediately into 2.5% glutaraldehyde fixative. SEM examination was conducted as described previously ( Wang et al., 2016 ) to compare the oil gland morphology between RA and HP kumquat. 2.3 Analysis of volatile organic compounds The peel samples collected from fruit at IM1, IM3 and FM stages were employed to analyze volatile organic compounds. For each stage, 45 fruit were used in total for three replicates, with 15 fruit for each replicate. After snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, samples were stored at − 80 °C for further analysis. VOCs were extracted using the method as follows. Finely ground frozen citrus exocarp (0.25 g) was mixed with 2 mL of aqueous 22% CaCl 2 , followed by addition of 10 mL dichloromethane (DCM) and stirring. The mixture was frozen at − 20 °C overnight. The middle DCM layer was collected and added into a small amount of water-free MgSO 4 , the mixture was then filtered using glass wool. The filtrates were collected and dried under a stream of nitrogen. An aliquot of 0.5 mL DCM ( containing 43.75 μg/mL methyl nonanoate as internal standard) was added to dissolve the sample, which was then filtered through a 0.22 µm pore size Millipore membrane filter prior to GC-MS. VOCs were analyzed by GC-MS on a Shimadzu TQ8050 GC-MS. Splitless injections of 1 μL samples over 30 s were made at 240 °C onto a DB-Wax® capillary column (20 m × 0.18 mm i.d. × 0.18 µm film thickness, Agilent) with a He flow of 15 μL s −1 . The oven temperature program was 2 min at 35 °C, followed by 3 °C min −1 to 110 °C, then 6 °C min −1 to 170 °C, followed by 8 °C min −1 to 250 °C, and then held for 3 min. Compounds were identified and quantified by comparison to commercially available standards. For compounds without a commercial standard, the quantification was conducted based on a compound of similar structure. Results are expressed on a fresh weight basis. 2.4 Sensory evaluation Sensory quality was evaluated by means of consumer-acceptance as described previously ( Goldenberg et al., 2015 ) with minor modifications. The tasters consisted of 35 randomly selected graduate students with ages ranging from 22 to 28 years old. They were recruited to conduct the sensory evaluation experiment at the Sensory Evaluation Platform of Horticultural Products at Huazhong Agricultural University in China. Participants were provided with a scale that ranged from score 0 (totally unacceptable) to score 10 (totally acceptable) to evaluate five sensory attributes, namely sweetness, aroma, sourness, pungency, and overall acceptability. Aroma was defined as the pleasant aromatic perception when chewing, and pungency as ‘the unpleasant perception of irritation in the mouth’. Fruit with uniform shape and size at FM stage were selected for sensory evaluation. Fresh harvested fruit of both kumquat cultivars were served as three different sample types: whole fruit, separated peel and separated pulp. At the beginning of the experiment, staff members marked number ‘1′ in 35 disposable cups and number ‘2′ in another 35 disposable cups, and then cut each fruit into two halves, one half was served as ‘whole fruit’ sample, and the other half was separated into peel and pulp and served as ‘peel sample’ and ‘pulp sample’. The whole fruit sample, peel sample and pulp sample of each HP kumquat fruit were put into the same disposable cup marked ‘1′, and the whole fruit sample, peel sample and pulp sample of each RA kumquat were put into the same disposable cup marked ‘2′, and immediately served to a participant. Each participant received one cup marked ‘1′ and one cup marked ‘2′. Participants were reminded in advance not to deliberately distinguish the samples by appearance. Participants were asked to write down a score for each attribute immediately after eating each sample type. The average score of the 35 participants for each attribute was determined as the final score. Between the interval of two sample evaluation, participants cleansed the palate with water for 5 s. Two independent experiments were conducted for the sensory evaluation by the same 35 participants. 2.5 Measurement of soluble sugar and organic acid content The peel and pulp were collected separately for fruit at FM stage, fruit number and sampling method refer to Method Section 2.3 . Soluble sugars and organic acids were detected with the approach of GC analysis as described previously ( Yu et al., 2012 ) with minor modifications. 1 g of fine ground sample was suspended in chilled 5 mL 80% methanol and then held in a 75 °C water bath for 30 min. After a 90 min ultrasonic extraction and centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and 200 μL internal standard (25 g L –1 methyl-α-D-glucopyranoside) was added. The solution was made up to 10 mL with 80% methanol, and a 2 mL aliquot was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min. A 0.5 mL aliquot of this final supernatant was vacuum-dried and derivatized, exactly 1 μL of each sample was analyzed using GC as described previously ( Yu et al., 2012 ). Sugars and organic acids were identified through a comparison of retention times using standard compounds from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and quantified based on standard curves. Results are expressed on a fresh weight basis. 2.6 Pathogen preparation and inoculation P. italicum and G. candidum strains were previously isolated from rotten citrus and kept for use after identification at Huazhong Agricultural University. Both strains were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (20% potato extract, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar) at 25 °C for 7 d before use. Spore suspensions were adjusted to 1 × 10 6 CFU mL −1 by using a hemocytometer. Eighty fruit of RA and HP kumquat at FM stage were respectively used for fungi inoculation as described previously ( Chen et al., 2018 ) with minor modifications. After being disinfected with 2% NaClO, fruit were washed with distilled water and then air dried for use. One wound with a diameter of 2 mm and at a 2 mm depth was made at the equator of each kumquat fruit using a sterile bodkin. An aliquot of 2 μL of the prepared 1 × 10 6 CFU mL −1 spore suspension was inoculated into the wound of each fruit using micropipette, which was then air-dried under sterile conditions. Fruit were stored in plastic fresh-keeping boxes (10 fruit per box) at 25 °C with a relative humidity of ∼90%. Boxes were kept undisturbed and lesions were analyzed every 12 h for fruit in a randomly chosen box. Lesion diameters were measured by a Vernier caliper and disease incidence was calculated for each period. One batch of 10 fruit in the box was selected for calculation at each period. The average value of lateral diameter and longitudinal diameter of each lesion was considered the final lesion diameter. The experiment was carried out using two independent replicates with similar results. 2.7 RNA isolation, cDNA library construction and transcriptome sequencing Peel samples of RA and HP kumquat at 0 h and 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum were collected for transcriptome analysis. Total RNA was extracted from peel sample using TRIzol® Reagent according the manufacturer’s instructions. Then RNA quality was determined by 5300 Bioanalyser (Agilent) and quantified using the ND-2000 (NanoDrop Technologies). Only high-quality RNA samples (OD260/280 = 1.8–2.2, OD260/230 ≥2.0, RIN ≥6.5, 28 S:18 S ≥1.0, >1 μg) were used to construct sequencing libraries. RNA purification, reverse transcription, library construction and sequencing were performed at Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). In brief, mRNA was isolated from 1 μg of total RNA by polyA selection using oligo(dT) beads and then fragmented in fragmentation buffer. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, CA) with random hexamer primers (Illumina). The synthesized cDNA was subjected to end-repair, phosphorylation and ‘A′ base addition according to Illumina’s library construction protocol. Libraries were size selected for cDNA target fragments of 300 bp on 2% Low Range Ultra Agarose followed by PCR amplification using Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) for 15 cycles. After quantification by Qubit 4.0, paired-end RNA-seq sequencing libraries were sequenced with a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (2 × 150 bp paired-end read length). 2.8 Gene expression quantification Raw paired-end reads were trimmed and quality controlled by fastp ( https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp ) with default parameters. Clean reads were separately aligned to the reference Hongkong kumquat ( Fortunella hindsii ) genome ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/orange/index.php ) with orientation mode using HISAT2 software. The mapped reads of each sample were assembled by StringTie in a reference-based approach. The RNA-seq raw data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under accession number PRJNA1000751 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA1000751 ). To identify DEGs between two different samples, the expression level of each transcript was calculated according to the transcripts per million reads (TPM) method. RSEM was used to quantify gene abundances. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2. DEGs with |log2FC |≧ 1 and FDR ≦ 0.05 were considered to be significant DEGs. GO enrichment analysis was performed using Goatools to identify which DEGs were significantly enriched in GO terms at a Bonferroni-corrected P-value ≤ 0.05 compared with the whole-transcriptome background. 2.9 Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation of differentially expressed genes Some DEGs were chosen to validate the accuracy of RNA-Seq result by qRT-PCR. Total RNA of all samples for qRT-PCR analysis was same as those for RNA-seq. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR) was performed with a Roche LightCycler® 480 II system using 2 × LightCycler 480 SYBR Green master mix (Roche, Germany) and a three-step program, as described previously ( Gong et al., 2021 ). All analyses were done in duplicate using three biological replicates. The primers were designed using Geneious software, except for ACTIN , PDF1.2 , LS and GER as described previously ( Rodríguez et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2021 ) ( Table S1 ). The RT-qPCR data were normalized to the expression of ACTIN and analyzed using LightCycler 480 software release 1.5.0 (Roche). 2.10 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and/or Excel 2013. Continuous variables were compared by independent t -test (two groups) and one-way ANOVA followed by LSD's post hoc tests (more than two groups). A p -value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 3 Results 3.1 Characterization of oil gland development in ‘Rongan’ and mutant ‘Huapi’ kumquat fruit The exocarp of citrus fruit are rich in oil glands that are critical sites for deposition of essential oils. Occasionally, plants with fruit exhibiting abnormal oil glands are produced by spontaneous mutations. In this study, fruit of ‘Rongan’ (RA) kumquat ( Fig. 1 A) and its natural seedling mutant ‘Huapi’ (HP) ( Fig. 1 B) were compared for oil gland development. The morphology was first analyzed using fruit at the fully mature (FM) stage. Fewer and smaller oil glands were unevenly distributed in the exocarp of HP fruit when compared to that in RA ( Fig. 1 C–G). On average 2366 oil glands per fruit were formed in RA kumquat, which was 5.3 times higher than that in HP kumquat (446) ( Fig. 1 H). Furthermore, the average diameter size of oil glands in RA kumquat is 1.26 mm, which was 2.5x that observed in HP (0.50 mm) ( Fig. 1 I). The effect of these differences in oil gland number and morphology on the thickness of exocarp in kumquat fruit was then investigated. Exocarp thickness was 0.32 mm in mutant HP kumquat, which was only approximately 1/6 of that in RA kumquat (1.88 mm) ( Fig. 1 J). To understand whether abnormal oil glands are produced at the onset of fruit development or later in fruit development, optical microscopy was used to examine the morphology of oil glands at four different fruit developmental stages ( Fig. S1A ). Results showed that there were round oil glands in both RA and mutant HP fruit from the earliest developmental stage of IM1 ( Fig. S1B ). However, oil glands of HP were sparsely and unevenly distributed in the peel at all four stages, whilst in RA oil glands were densely distributed throughout fruit development ( Fig. S1B ). Oil gland size of HP kumquat increased throughout fruit development, from an average diameter of 0.09 mm at the IM1 stage to 0.20 mm at MG stage ( Fig. S1C ). However, the size of oil glands in HP kumquat was smaller than that of RA from an early stage, with the average diameter being 68.4% and 33.0% of that in RA kumquat at IM1 stage (0.14 mm) and MG stage (0.60 mm), respectively ( Fig. S1C ). These data indicate that oil glands in HP show a slower expansion rate than those of RA kumquat during fruit development. To examine the ultrastructure of oil glands, SEM was used to examine oil glands at the MG stage in RA and HP. In RA fruit, secretory cavities were intact，large and clearly visible inside in the oil glands, whilst in HP the oil glands were smaller and without secretory cavities inside ( Fig. S1D ). 3.2 Comparison of volatile profiles in ‘Rongan’ and mutant ‘Huapi’ kumquat fruit To test if the presence of abnormal oil glands affected volatile accumulation, the VOC profiles of RA and HP fruit at IM1, IM3 and FM stage were examined by GC-MS. Thirty VOCs were identified in HP kumquat, which was seven less than in RA ( Table S2 ). The number of volatiles identified in HP fruit gradually increased as the fruit developed, with fifteen, nineteen and twenty-nine VOCs identified in HP fruit at the IM1, IM3 and FM stages, respectively. In RA fruit more VOCs were identified (38, 37 and 36, at the IM1, IM3 and FM stages, respectively; Table S2 ), but the number of VOCs did not change as the fruit developed. Total VOC content increased throughout fruit development in HP fruit, with total concentrations being 10.8, 33.8 and 91.5 mg kg −1 at IM1, IM3 and FM stage, respectively ( Table S2 ). VOC content in RA fruit also increased during development, and total VOC concentrations were higher than HP kumquat at all developmental stages (337.7, 333.69 and 2336.4 mg kg −1 at IM1, IM3 and FM stages, respectively; Table S2 ). To determine the dominant components that resulted in VOC variation between HP and RA kumquat, a PCA analysis of VOC profiles was performed. HP and RA were clearly separated in the PCA plot ( Fig. 2 A). PC1 (F1), explaining 56.3% of the variation, separated immature HP kumquat from immature RA (IM1 and IM3), while PC2 (F2), explaining an additional 26.6% of the variation, separated fully mature HP kumquat from fully mature RA kumquat ( Fig. 2 A). Compounds with factor values > 0.90 were selected as the main components for both PC1 and PC2. As a result, seventeen main components separating immature HP kumquat from immature RA kumquat were defined, including ten sesquiterpenes, five monoterpene derivatives and two sesquiterpene derivatives ( Table S3 ). Among them, germacrene D was present at the highest concentrations, followed by germacrene B, δ -elemene and bicyclogermacrene ( Table S2 , Fig. S2 ). The amount of germacrene D increased from 1.7 mg kg −1 (IM1) to 4.2 mg kg −1 (FM) as HP kumquat developed, whilst it decreased from 17.1 mg kg −1 (IM1) to 8.4 mg kg −1 (FM) in RA ( Table S2 , Fig. S2 ). Seven main compounds separated fully mature HP kumquat from fully mature RA, with all seven being monoterpenes: limonene, β -myrcene, α -pinene, sabinene, β -phellandrene, α -terpinolene, and camphene ( Table S3 ). Limonene was the most abundant compound in both cultivars, with concentrations of 4.2, 24.6 and 75.0 mg kg −1 in HP kumquat at IM1, IM3 and FM stage, respectively, accounting for 38.4%, 72.7% and 82.0% of total VOCs ( Fig. 2 B; Table S2 ). Of note, higher limonene content was observed in RA kumquat, with concentrations of 265.7, 281.6, and 2271.2 mg kg −1 at IM1, IM3 and FM stage, respectively, accounting for 78.7%, 84.4% and 97.2% of total VOCs ( Fig. 2 B; Table S2 ). Besides, β -myrcene, α -pinene and camphene were present at 20-, 21- and 3-fold lower concentrations in fully mature HP kumquat compared to RA, respectively ( Fig. 2 B; Table S2 ). Sabinene, β -phellandrene and α -terpinolene were not detected in HP kumquat, but were detected at 1.8, 3.8 and 0.2 mg kg −1 in fully mature RA kumquat, respectively ( Fig. 2 B; Table S2 ). 3.3 Sensory evaluation of mature fruit of ‘Rongan’ and mutant ‘Huapi’ kumquat Flavor is perceived as a combination of taste and aroma, thus it is an essential factor affecting consumer preference of fruit. A sensory panel analysis was used to evaluate the difference in consumer acceptability between mature fruit of RA and mutant HP kumquat based on five sensory attributes (sweetness, aroma, pungency, sourness and overall acceptability). First, the acceptability of flavor of whole kumquat fruit was evaluated, with the panelists scoring samples from 0 (the lowest acceptance) to 100 (the highest acceptance). Results showed that scores for all five indices were higher in mutant HP kumquat than in RA ( Fig. 3 A). The acceptability score of sweetness was 78.1 in HP kumquat, which was 26.4 points higher than in RA. The acceptability of aroma was 61.4 in HP kumquat, which was 17.5 points higher than in RA. In addition, as negative flavor indices, acceptability of pungency and sourness was 76.1 and 86.9 points respectively in HP kumquat, which was 25.2 and 19.2 points higher than in RA respectively. The overall consumer acceptability of mutant HP kumquat was 78.7, which was 26.3 points higher than in RA kumquat. As the peel of kumquat is edible, the respective contribution of peel and pulp to fruit flavor and consumer acceptability was explored by presenting sensory panelists with individual peel and pulp samples to taste. The mean acceptability score of sweetness was 77.3 in the pulp of HP kumquat, which was similar to that of the whole fruit, but higher than the score of 64.3 for peel ( Fig. 3 B). In RA kumquat, mean acceptability of sweetness was 48.0 in pulp, similar to that in whole fruit, but a lower score of 37.3 was measured in its peel compared with that of whole fruit ( Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that consumer perception of sweetness in whole fruit of both cultivars is mainly from the pulp, and less from the peel. The mean acceptability score of aroma was 55.1 in the pulp of HP kumquat, similar to that in whole fruit, but a lower score of 48.7 were measured in its peel compared with whole fruit (61.4), indicating that acceptability of aroma in HP fruit was mainly contributed by pulp ( Fig. 3 C). However, the mean acceptability score of aroma in the pulp and peel of RA were both similar to that of whole fruit ( Fig. 3 C). The mean acceptability score for pungency was 87.3 in pulp of mutant HP kumquat, which was higher than that in whole fruit (76.1) ( Fig. 3 D). Acceptability of pungency for peel of HP showed no significant difference with that of whole fruit (67.3). In RA, similar trends were observed. Mean acceptability of pungency was 70.6 in pulp, which was higher than that in whole fruit (50.9) and peel (42.9), with the score in whole fruit and peel showing no significant difference ( Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that it is peel that mainly contributes to acceptability of pungency in both mutant HP kumquat and RA. Mean acceptability for sourness in both pulp (87.9) and peel (80.0) of HP kumquat showed no significant difference to that in whole fruit (86.9), indicating that sourness of whole HP might be contributed by both pulp and peel ( Fig. 3 E). In RA, mean acceptability of sourness scores showed similar trends (70.4 in pulp, 67.7 in whole fruit and 64.6 in peel). Mean overall acceptance in HP kumquat had a score of 81.1, which was similar to that in whole fruit (78.7) and higher than that in peel (69.1) ( Fig. 3 F). In RA, the mean score of overall acceptance of whole fruit (52.4) showed no significant difference to both pulp (54.1) and peel (48.7) ( Fig. 3 F). These results indicate that overall acceptance is mainly driven by pulp for HP kumquat, but both pulp and peel contribute to overall acceptance for RA kumquat. Another independent replicate was conducted for these evaluations with similar results ( Fig. S3 ). Sugar and organic acid contents are likely to contribute to flavor acceptability scores measured in the sensory panel evaluation. Therefore, total soluble solids (TSS) and titratable acidity (TA) were measured in whole fruit samples from HP and RA. Results showed that TSS of HP kumquat was 19.3%, which was higher than 12.3% in RA ( Fig. 3 G). HP fruit had a lower TA of 0.47% compared with that of 0.61% in RA ( Fig. 3 H). The major sugar components were then measured in both pulp and peel. Results showed that sucrose and fructose were the most abundant in both pulp and peel of kumquat, followed by glucose. The concentration of sucrose was 136.0 g kg −1 and 87.5 g kg −1 in the pulp and peel of HP, respectively, which was 1.9- and 1.4-fold higher than that in the pulp and peel of RA (72.5 g kg −1 and 61.7 g kg −1 ), respectively ( Fig. 3 I-J). Fructose content was 141.6 g kg −1 and 95.8 g kg −1 in the pulp and peel of HP, respectively, higher than that in the corresponding tissue of RA (68.6 g kg −1 and 63.2 g kg −1 ) as well ( Fig. 3 I-J). Glucose content were also higher in the pulp of HP kumquat (38.0 g kg −1 ) than in RA (31.1 g kg −1 ), but lower in the peel of HP kumquat (19.7 g kg −1 ) than in RA (32.6 g kg −1 ) ( Fig. 3 I–J). For organic acids, no significant differences were observed between HP and RA kumquat for malic acid, the most abundant organic acid in pulp ( Fig. 3 K–L). However, citric acid content was lower (∼ 70% decrease) in HP kumquat than in RA, especially in pulp ( Fig. 3 K). Citric acid content was also 30% lower in peel of HP (1.5 g kg −1 ) than in RA (2.2 g kg −1 ) ( Fig. 3 L). Quinic acid was the most abundant organic acid in peel and was higher in HP kumquat than in RA ( Fig. 3 K–L). 3.4 Infection of mature ‘Rongan’ and mutant ‘Huapi’ fruit by the postharvest pathogens P. italicum and G. candidum To understand if the presence of abnormal oil glands and changes in VOC production affected infection of citrus fruit by postharvest pathogens, RA and HP fruit were challenged with P. italicum and G. candidum , two of the most serious postharvest fungal pathogens in citrus. After inoculation with P. italicum , water-soaked lesions were clearly observed by 24 h after inoculation with 1.0 × 10 6 CFU mL −1 P. italicum in RA fruit ( Fig. 4 A). After 48 h, disease lesions with ∼7.0 mm diameter were observed on RA fruit ( Fig. 4 A), whereas smaller sized (∼4.0 mm) lesions occurred on HP fruit ( Fig. 4 B). The greater resistance of HP fruit to P. italicum infection continued throughout the infection period ( Fig. 4 C). By 96 h post inoculation, disease lesions in HP fruit were only ∼60% of the size of lesions in RA fruit. The disease lesions were inhibited in HP fruit compared with RA fruit, however, the disease incidences of RA and HP fruit were identical after inoculating with P. italicum at each parallel period ( Table S4 ). Results showed that disease incidence was 10% by 24 h and 36 h after inoculation for both HP and RA fruit, and sharply increased to 100% by 48 h after inoculation. To investigate the relationships between disease resistance and oil gland development as well as VOC biosynthesis, total VOC content was firstly calculated for HP and RA kumquat at 0 d and 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after inoculation with P. italicum . Results showed that total VOC content increased in HP kumquat at 48 h and 72 h after inoculation, then return to pre-infection level at 96 h after inoculation ( Fig. 4 D). However, total VOC content continued to decline in RA kumquat from 48 h after inoculation ( Fig. 4 D). The correlation between lesion diameter and oil gland size as well as total VOC content were then calculated by integrating data of HP and RA kumquat 48 h after inoculation . Results showed that after P. italicum invasion, lesion diameter displayed a strongly positive correlation with both oil gland diameter (r = 0.701, P = 0.001) and total VOC content of kumquat fruit (r = 0.852, P = 0.031) ( Fig. 4 E-F). Additionally, an extra verification of correlation between lesion diameter and total VOC content was conducted using data at 96 h after inoculation, a strongly positive correlation was also showed in the results, with r = 0.879, P = 0.021( Fig. 4 G). At 24 h after inoculation with 1.0 × 10 6 CFU mL −1 G. candidum , slight water-soaked lesions appeared on both HP kumquat and RA fruit ( Fig. S4A –B). Stronger resistance to G. candidum infection in HP fruit was observed as early as 36 h after inoculation. At this time, disease lesions were ∼8.0 mm in diameter in RA fruit, but smaller size (∼1.0 mm) in HP ( Fig. S4C ). Resistance of HP fruit to G. candidum continued through the time course ( Fig. S4C ). By 96 h post-inoculation, disease lesions in HP fruit were ∼65% of the size of lesions in RA fruit. In addition, disease incidence of RA fruit increased faster than HP fruit after inoculating with G. candidum ( Table S4 ). It took only 12 h for RA fruit to get the disease incidence rising from 20% (24 h after inoculation) to 100% (36 h after inoculation), but a longer 36 h was taken for HP fruit. The relationships between disease resistance and oil gland development as well as VOC biosynthesis were also verified for G. candidum invasion. Total VOC content in HP kumquat showed an sharp increase at 48 h after inoculation, then returned to pre-infection levels from 72 h after inoculation ( Fig. S4D ). However, total VOC content in RA kumquat was unchanged at 48 h after inoculation, then decreased from 72 h after inoculation ( Fig. S4D ). Results of correlation analysis showed that after G. candidum invasion, lesion diameter displayed a strongly positive correlation with both oil gland diameter (r = 0.786, P < 0.001) and total VOC content of kumquat fruit (r = 0.983, P < 0.001) ( Fig. S4E -F). Additionally, an extra verification of correlation between lesion diameter and total VOC content was conducted using data at 96 h after inoculation, a strongly positive correlation was also showed in the results, with r = 0.967, P = 0.002( Fig. S4G ). In summary, both lower total VOC content and smaller oil gland size of HP kumquat were associated with its increased disease resistance against postharvest fungi pathogens P. italicum and G. candidum . 3.5 Defense response genes in response to fungal infection in kumquat fruit revealed by RNA-seq To identify genes potentially associated with stronger resistance of HP kumquat to fungal infection, fruit peel of HP and RA at 0 d and 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum were subjected to RNA-seq. Treatment group consisted of three biological replicates for each cultivar. In total, more than 6.54 Gb of clean reads were generated for each sample. Of the clean reads, the percentage of bases with a quality value greater than 30 (Q30) was over 94.64%. Among all the libraries, the average ratios of the clean reads uniquely mapped to the reference genome ranged from 93.15% to 94.08%. These results indicated that the quality of the sequencing results was acceptable ( Table S5 ). Pearson correlation analysis of total expression profiles revealed that there was a high correlation within each group, supporting the reliability of the biological replicates ( Fig. 5 A). PCA revealed that HP had distinct expression profiles vs. those of RA, both before and after inoculation ( Fig. 5 B). Differential expression analysis in HP between the 0 d vs 48 h samples revealed 2429 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 1181 (48.6%) were upregulated ( Fig. S5A ). For RA, 3402 DEGs were identified between 0 d vs 48 h, of which 1973 were upregulated. GO analysis was then performed to determine the functional distribution of the DEGs. Fig. S5B shows the distribution of DEGs when placed into the three GO categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. The primary changes in these three categories were similar in both HP and RA kumquat when comparing 0 d vs 48 h samples. For the biological process category, the GO terms enriched with DEGs included ‘cellular process’ and ‘metabolic process’. In the cellular component category, the top two subcategories were ‘cell part’ and ‘membrane part’. For molecular function, the top two subcategories were ‘catalytic activity’ and ‘binding’. Go enrichment analysis of DEGs in the biological process category associated with defense response were then analyzed in more detail. The scatterplots in Fig. 5 C and Fig. S5C illustrated that DEGs were enriched in many functional pathways. A total of 138 defense related DEGs between 0 d and 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum were identified. Of these, 31 DEGs were identified specifically in HP kumquat ( Table S6 ), 75 DEGs specifically in RA ( Table S7 ), and 32 DEGs in both of HP and RA ( Fig. 5 D). Thirty-one defense response genes which were specific to HP might contribute to the stronger resistance of this cultivar to fungal infection. Among them, eleven genes were upregulated in HP after inoculation ( Fig. 5 E), including chitinase (CHI, sjg016680), carboxylesterase (CXE, sjg236800), Pyricularia oryzae resistance 21-like protein (Pi21L1, sjg122860; Pi21L2, sjg123990), proline iminopeptidase (PIP, sjg146880), D-xylose-proton symporter-like (XYLL, sjg249100), ERF transcription factors (ERF096, sjg198000; ERF, sjg215290), enhanced disease resistance 4 like-protein (EDR4, sjg238140), thaumatin-like protein (TLP, sjg189580) and disease resistance protein ( DRL, sjg094820). 3.6 Comparison of candidate DEGs in response to fungal infection in RA and HP kumquat fruit by qRT-PCR Expression levels of nine of the above-mentioned defense response genes were further verified by qRT-PCR. The results were generally consistent with the RNA-seq, with all the nine defense response genes upregulated in HP kumquat 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum ( Fig. 6 ). Of note, at 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum , the expression levels of FcERF096 , FcCHI , FcCXE , FcPi21L1 , FcPi21L2 , FcPIP and FcXYLL in HP kumquat were significantly higher than that in RA kumquat， indicating that these genes might involve in the enhanced disease resistance of HP kumquat ( Fig. 6 ). Among these genes, the expression of FcERF096 was increased to the highest by up to about 30 folds in HP kumquat 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum , suggesting the initiation of ethylene-mediated Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR). Therefore, the expression level of the ISR marker gene FcPDF1.2 was further analyzed. Result showed that FcPDF1.2 gene expression was significantly higher in HP kumquat both before and after P. italicum invasion than that in RA kumquat ( Fig. 6 ), indicating that ethylene-mediated ISR might involve in the enhanced disease resistance of HP kumquat. According to the VOC profiles of RA and HP fruit, limonene and germacrene D were respectively the most abundant monoterpene and sesquiterpene in both cultivars, and at FM stage, the concentration of limonene and germacrene D in RA fruit were significantly higher than that in HP fruit. In order to analyze the relationship between VOCs and their impact on disease resistance, we further analyzed the expression levels of limonene synthase gene ( FcLS ) and germacrene D synthase gene ( FcGER ). The results revealed that the expression level of FcLS was significantly lower in HP kumquat than in RA kumquat both before and after P. italicum invasion, whereas the expression level of FcGER was significantly lower in HP kumquat than in RA kumquat only before P. italicum invasion. Moreover, FcLS gene was downregulated in RA kumquat but upregulated in HP kumquat after P. italicum invasion, whereas FcGER gene was only downregulated in RA kumquat after P. italicum invasion ( Fig. 6 ). 4 Discussion Oil glands are closely associated with the synthesis and accumulation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially volatile terpenes in citrus fruit ( Liang et al., 2006, Voo et al., 2012, Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019 ). In this study, we undertook a comprehensive analysis to compare oil gland development and VOCs accumulation in a natural mutant kumquat variety ‘Huapi’ and its wild type progenitor ‘Rongan’. Smaller and lower number of oil glands were showed in HP kumquat in comparison with RA kumquat of the parallel stages, accompanied by lower content of VOCs but similar VOC components. These results were in consistence with the previous studies that proving oil glands’ function in the VOCs accumulation and metabolism ( Liang et al., 2006, Voo et al., 2012, Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019 ), and further demonstrated that the difference in oil gland morphology between the two varieties mainly affected the VOC content rather than the composition. Our results indicated that oil glands are present in both RA and mutant HP fruit from the earliest developmental stage. However, oil glands of HP kumquat were sparsely and unevenly distributed in the peel at all developmental stages, whilst in RA kumquat oil glands were densely distributed throughout the fruit development. This result suggested that any changes in VOCs accumulation in HP kumquat resulting from the difference in oil glands were likely to be quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. This hypothesis was supported initially by VOC analysis, which indicated that the sparsely distributed small oil glands in HP fruit supported lower essential oil accumulation throughout development. The main components separating HP kumquat from RA were defined, with most being monoterpenes at the FM stage and sesquiterpenes at IM stages (IM1 and IM3). In nearly all cases the separation was driven by lower accumulation of the compounds in HP vs RA fruit. The differences in VOC accumulation between HP and RA indicates that fruit metabolism was likely to be disturbed by the presence of abnormal oil glands. Sensory panel analysis was used to evaluate the difference in consumer acceptability between fully mature fruit of RA and mutant HP kumquat. Phenotypic data for VOCs, sugars and organic acids was collected for the same samples, allowing a direct and powerful comparison of the two datasets. Mean acceptability scores for sweetness, aroma, pungency, sourness and overall acceptance of mutant HP kumquat were all higher than for RA. In HP, the higher mean sweetness acceptability likely due to the higher TSS and concentrations of sucrose and fructose (since glucose was lower in the peel of HP kumquat). The higher mean sourness acceptability score is likely related to the lower TA and reduced citric acid content (since malic acid did not change between the two cultivars). In addition, the mean aroma acceptability scores in HP were higher than in RA. GC-MS analysis indicated that concentrations of most monoterpenes were greatly reduced in HP compared to RA. This suggests that monoterpenes, despite their high concentration in RA fruit, might not contribute strongly to fruit aroma. Our results are supported by a previous study in transgenic orange showing that a 50-fold decrease in D-limonene concentrations was neutral for odor perception ( Rodríguez et al., 2017 ). The increased aroma acceptability in HP fruit might instead be due to unmasking of pleasant smelling sesquiterpenes and other compounds. Mean pungency acceptability scores were higher in HP. As pungency is ‘the unpleasant perception of irritation in the mouth’, it could be made up of a variety of negative flavor notes. The reduction in some monoterpene components may contribute to this difference. Of note, myrcene is peppery and spicy, which were negative flavor descriptors ( http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/ffavordb ). Other terpenes reduced in HP fruit also have a number of negative flavor descriptors. α -pinene to be harsh and minty; and camphene to be woody, herbal, and camphor ( http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/ffavordb ). Lower levels of these monoterpenes of negative flavor notes in HP fruit may decrease the perceived pungency recorded by panelists. Overall, the strong increase in mean acceptability for whole HP fruit will almost certainly be driven by a combination of all the sensory attributes measured. To understand if the presence of abnormal oil glands and reduced VOC content affected infection by postharvest pathogens, RA and HP kumquat fruit were challenged with two common fungal pathogens infecting citrus fruit during postharvest. Our results indicated that the presence of abnormal developed oil glands and reduced VOC accumulation in mature HP kumquat was positively correlated with enhanced resistance to both P. italicum and G. candidum in planta. For P. italicum infection, the lower expression level of limonene synthase gene ( FcLS ) in HP kumquat both before and after P. italicum invasion further implied the negative role of limonene in enhanced resistance of HP kumquat to P. italicum. This result does not fit with the dogma that essential oils in citrus are required for pathogen defense, based on many previous studies showing that essential oils and the terpene compounds within them demonstrate antifungal activity when tested via in vitro methods ( Jing et al., 2014, Tao et al., 2014 ). However, our results are consistent with previous studies in transgenic orange, which showed that downregulation of a D-limonene synthase gene reduced D-limonene (the predominant terpene in orange peel) accumulation in orange fruit and led to enhanced resistance of the fruit to the fungal pathogen P. digitatum ( Rodríguez et al., 2011 ). Similarly in apple, downregulation of the ( E , E )-α-farnesene synthase gene reduced the accumulation of ( E , E )-α-farnesene (the predominant terpene in apple skin) in transgenic apple fruit which was associated with decreased disease initiation rates for three pathogens, Colletotrichum acutatum , P. expansum and Neofabraea alba ( Souleyre et al., 2019 ). The mechanism by which a reduction in terpene accumulation increases disease resistance is unclear. Rodríguez et al. (2014) performed a global gene expression analysis of limonene-synthase downregulated versus empty vector control transgenic fruit and showed that reducing D-limonene content upregulated genes involved in the innate immune response. Basal levels of jasmonic acid were higher in the controls compared with limonene-synthase downregulated oranges. Upon fungal challenge, jasmonic acid metabolism and signaling drastically increased in the limonene-synthase downregulated oranges. Souleyre et al. (2019) also suggested that upregulation of genes involved in defense responses might be occurring in apples when ( E , E )-α-farnesene levels were reduced. However, which genes related to defense response that were involved was not described. According to transcriptome and qRT-PCR data, six defense response genes (including FcCHI , FcCXE , FcPi21L1 , FcPi21L2 , FcPIP and FcXYLL ) were upregulated in HP kumquat and their expression levels were significantly higher than that in RA kumquat at 48 h after inoculation with P. italicum , indicating that transcriptional regulation is likely to be at least one of the multiple mechanisms for regulating fungal resistance in HP kumquat. Among the six defense response genes, chitinases (CHI) could degrade the fungal cell wall chitin ( Malik, 2019 ) and have been reported to exhibit resistance against postharvest fungal pathogens in transgenic lemon fruit ( Oliveri et al., 2015 ). Carboxylesterases (CXE) have been shown to break down the outer layer of the fungal cell wall and have been reported to exhibit antifungal activity in plants such as pepper and lemon fruit ( Seo et al., 2018 ). Pyricularia oryzae resistance 21 protein (Pi21) is a proline-rich protein and deletion in its proline-rich motif confers durable Pyricularia oryzae resistance in rice ( Fukuoka et al., 2009, Fukuoka and Okuno, 2019 ). Proline iminopeptidase (PIP) is an exopeptidase that specifically removes proline from the N-terminus of peptides or proteins ( Dong et al., 2022 ), which might result in proline accumulation. Proline accumulation was usually linked to abiotic stress. One recent study revealed that the accumulation of L-proline and the expression of proline iminopeptidase gene increased in both fls2 and robed/f double mutants under salt conditions ( Yu et al., 2023 ). There were few direct studies on PIP and XYLL (D-xylose-proton symporter-like) involving in disease resistance. However, a previous study revealed that L-proline and D-xylose were significantly elevated as potential biocontrol in stress-tolerant Tricho-fusants interacting with phytopathogen Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc ( Hirpara, Gajera, 2023 ). Transcription factors are also reported to be critical in regulation of plant fungal defense resistance, especially ERFs ( Thirugnanasambantham et al., 2015, Li et al., 2020 ). AaORA , an AP2/ERF transcription factor from Artemisia annua , was reported to be a positive regulator in disease resistance to Botrytis cinerea and to induce expression of genes including BASIC CHITINASE ( Lu et al., 2013 ). In this study, the expression of FcERF096 , FcPDF1.2 (ISR marker gene) and FcCHI (encodes chitinase) were significantly higher in HP kumquat after P. italicum invasion than that in RA kumquat, suggesting the initiation of ethylene-mediated Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR) and they may be members of a network in which ERF regulates the enhancement of disease resistance in HP kumquat. The fungal resistance mechanism underlying in the genes mentioned above of HP kumquat need to further characterize. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, this study revealed superior sensory attributes and better fungal disease resistance of mutant HP kumquat compared with its progenitor RA kumquat. All of the detected sensory attributes, containing sweetness, aroma, pungency, sourness and overall acceptability, were of greater acceptability in HP kumquat. Moreover, lesion diameter of HP kumquat infected with P. italicum or G. candidum was smaller than that of RA kumquat. Oil gland size and VOCs content showed strongly negative correlation with disease resistance. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that FcERF096 , FcCHI , FcCXE , FcPi21L1 , FcPi21L2 , FcPIP and FcXYLL potentially involve in the enhanced disease resistance of HP fruit. Our results indicate that mutant HP kumquat with abnormal oil glands has superior sensory attributes and better fungal disease resistance than its progenitor RA kumquat, which were contributed at least in part to its abnormal oil glands and less VOCs content. Therefore, RA and HP kumquat has potential to be a pair of good materials for creating new technologies for improving fruit quality and agronomic traits.
