In this study, a high-quality genome sequence of G. citri-aurantii was obtained by Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing (SMRT). Approximately 5.43 Gb of clean data were obtained and a total of 27.94-Mb genomic sequence was mapped to 10 chromosome groups after high-through chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) assembly. In addition, three polygalacturonase genes which were related to pathogenicity in G. citri-aurantii genome were discovered. And transcriptome data of guazatine-resistance had been analyzed, the results showed that the guazatine-resistance of G. citri-aurantii was related to two ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family genes, six major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter family genes and two multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporter family genes. In summary, our research may provide novel insights into the effective control of this pathogen."

          "Sour rot, caused by Geotrichum citri-aurantii (Ferraris), is one of the most important fungal diseases of citrus fruit, affecting all species and cultivars in the world [ 1 ]. After being first reported in 1917, this disease has been frequently reported around the world [ 2 ]. During the period of harvest, storage, transport and handling, citrus fruits are exposed to G. citri-aurantii pathogen and can be infected through wounds [ 3 ], especially during rainy seasons.",
          "Despite the severe damage caused by G. citri-aurantii , its infection mechanism and genetic information have not been thoroughly elucidated. Many researchers have tried to inhibition citrus sour rot by cistus aqueous extracts, thyme oil, sodium dehydroacetate of chemical control and yeasts of biological control [ 4–7 ]. However, no suitable methods have been found effectively controlling the occurrence and spread of sour rot disease and the genome of G. citri-aurantii is not yet released. Thus, obtaining genome information is one of the main strategies to elucidate pathogen infection mechanisms.",
          "It is known that pathogens can secrete a variety of cell wall degrading enzymes when they interact with plants, and Polygalacturonase (PG) is a phytopathogenic factor among the first enzymes degrading plant cell wall secreted by phytopathogenic fungi [ 8 ].Extraordinary, PG could promote infection by some pathogens according to transforming the mechanical strength and rheological properties of the cell wall [ 9 ]. In this study, the change of PG drawn our attention during the interaction between G. citri-aurantii and citrus. And we would explore the PG related genes in the G. citri-aurantii genome.",
          "Furthermore, guazatine is the only chemical fungicide that can control sour rot effectively [ 10 ]. As a broad-spectrum bactericidal agent, guazatine plays an important role in the biosynthesis of fungal esters, cell membrane function, and inhibiting spore germination [ 11 ], germ tube elongation and adherent cells and hyphae formation. In recent years, the incidence of sour rot has increased in many citrus-producing areas of China. Simultaneously, the resistance of G. citri-aurantii in citrus-producing areas has increased annually. The above-mentioned reports imply that G. citri-aurantii could adapt to the changing environment flexibly. Therefore, the G. citri-aurantii genome may be helpful for understanding the anti-drug mechanism of G. citri-aurantii , and it is more conducive to finding an effective method to control sour rot instead of traditional fungicides.",
          "In previous studies, ATP-binding cassette (ABC), major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporter family genes play a crucial role in the process of fungal resistance. Two ABC transporter family genes, PMR1 and PMR5, mediate 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) fungicide efflux [ 12 ]. The MFS transporter family genes also contributes to fungicide resistance in Penicillium digitatum [ 12 ]. The toxic efflux system consisting of PMR1 is directly involved in DMI resistance of fungi [ 13 ]. Multidrug efflux transporters play important roles in the regulation of fungal resistance to many DMI drugs. At present, in terms of the primary structure and special energy coupling mode, multidrug efflux transporters are categorized into five families. The MATE family is one of these families [ 14 ].",
          "It is reported that ABC transporter family genes, MFS transporter family genes and MATE family genes were proved to evolve resistance to guazatine in P. digitatum genome [ 10 ]. In this study, sequencing of G. citri-aurantii genome and guazatine- treatment transcriptome open the possibility to identify genes that are related to guazatine-resistance mechanism. And the purpose of this study was to get these genes in G. citri-aurantii genome associated with guazatine-resistance."

              "To identify genes related to the responses of G. citri-aurantii to the antifungal drug guazatine and the high resistance of G. citri-aurantii , differentially expressed genes of the ABC transporter family and MFS transporter family were further analyzed. In G2 transcriptome data, the expression of the two genes (EVM0003677, EVM0005437) from the ABC transporter family and six transporter genes (EVM0000087, EVM0000766, EVM0001093, EVM0003101, EVM0004095, EVM0005235) from the MFS transporter family made a big difference ( Table 2 ). In this study, RT-qPCR was used to validate the expression levels of eight transporter genes and the results were the same as the G2 transcriptome data ( Fig. 6 A, C ). The expression levels of five genes (EVM0003677, EVM0000087, EVM0003101, EVM0004095 and EVM0005235) were upregulated instead of the expression levels of five genes (EVM0005437, EVM0000766 and EVM0001093) were downregulated. These consequences indicate that overexpression of these genes may enhance the drug resistance of G. citri-aurantii .",
              "The G1 transcriptome data analysis revealed that six MATE transporters (EVM0000063, EVM0002368, EVM0001080, EVM0003579, EVM0005976, EVM6710) were related to drug resistance, and these transporter genes were not reported before this study. In the guazatine-resistant strain AY1-68, the expression levels of two MATE genes (EVM0000063, EVM0002368, seeing Table 2 ) were upregulated compared with the guazatine-susceptible strain AY-1 ( Fig. 6 B). The other five MATE genes had decreased expression. Notably, these MATE transporters were normal in AY1-68 after guazatine treatment. These results indicate that two ABC genes and six MFS genes of G. citri-aurantii were activated after guazatine treatment. However, two MATE genes may play a decisive role in enhancing drug resistance."

          "In postharvest diseases of citrus, the incidence of sour rot caused by G. citri-aurantii has increased annually in various producing areas of China [ 9 ]. Due to the large-scale use of the fungicide guazatine, the proportion of G. citri-aurantii -resistant mutant strains has also increased significantly. To further analyze G. citri-aurantii -resistant mechanism, the G. citri-aurantii genome of the economically important fungi was sequenced by SMRT in our study. The genome size is 28.10 Mb, and 17.93% of the genome is composed of repeat sequences. In particular, ~10 Mb consisted of repetitive sequences and the sequencing amount of a single sequencing cell reached 1 Gb. After Hi-C assembly, the sequence length and direction can be determined to be 27.58 Mb in the sequence mapped to the chromosome, accounting for 98.63% of the total length of the sequence located on the chromosome. In the genome structure, the number of repeats reached 11,476. Interestingly, Rest of genome were the most repeating sequence (82.17%). Notably, LINE and LTR account for 5.1 and 2.31%, respectively.",
          "Epigenetics is currently at the forefront in the identification of pathogen-induced modifications within host plants [ 45 ]. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark associated with plant immunity, but little is known about its roles in fungi infection of citrus [ 46 ]. The most studied type of DNA methylation in fungi is m5C, while in prokaryotic cells, it is m4C and m6A. Recently, 171,915 m4C (4-methyl-cytosine) and 11,784 m6A (6-methyl- adenosine) ( Fig. 2 B) in the G. citri-aurantii genome were identified by SMRT for the first time. Surprisingly, large numbers of m4C were observed in G. citri-aurantii . The m4C modification occurs with a higher frequency in the region of repetitive elements in the G. citri-aurantii genome ( Fig. 2 C and D), and the results indicate that m4C may be involved in the transposition of the transposons [ 45 ]. Methylation is one of the major factors to influences the transcription level in mutation. The possible relationship that candidate gene and methylation may be analyzed and explored in mutation AY1-68. Our results also suggest that m4C may be the focus of future research on sour rot.",
          "The transcripts were analyzed in accordance to the G. citri-aurantii genome. And all the functions in the genome were also identified in the transcriptome. From the total amount of genes, 3 PGs genes were related to pathogenesis and 814 genes encoded guazatine resistance-related genes.",
          "PG was first obtained from pectinase produced by pathogenic fungi by Cooper [ 46 ]. PG is thought to act by degrading homologous polygalactonic acid regions in plant cell walls [ 47 ]. PG is associated with fungal pathogenicity and toxicity by causing tissue degradation and protoplast death [ 48 ]. We found three PG genes in the G. citri-aurantii genome, and RT-qPCR results verified that the expression of three PG genes increased. These data further support the hypothesis that PG can promote G. citri-aurantii to cause citrus disease. The relation of the G. citri-aurantii strong pathogenicity and PG secretion is worth further studying. In a word, we predict that the pathogenicity of G. citri-aurantii will reduce if PGs are deleted, which will provide a new idea to control the sour rot for the future research.",
          "In drug resistance research of P. digitatum , further research provided evidence that transporter genes from the ABC transporter family and the MFS transporter family have also contributed to fungicide resistance. Two ABC transporter family genes, PMR1 and PMR5, mediate DMI fungicide efflux [ 49 ]. MATE is a multidrug efflux transporter that plays important roles in intrinsic and acquired resistance in many bacteria and in the regulation of fungi resistance to many DMI drugs [ 50 ]. In the study of G. citri-aurantii resistance, the expression of two genes from the ABC transporter family, six genes from the MFS transporter family and two genes from the MATE transporter family had changed a lot by RT-qPCR. These results attracted our attention to study the resistance of G. citri-aurantii to guazatine. In addition, most of the differentially expressed genes identified were transporter activity, so we speculated that the reason why G. citri-aurantii enhance resistance to guazatine may be mutations in genes related to transportation. This result may indicate the direction for our future research.",
          "In summary, we report a complete genome sequence of G. citri-aurantii using the SMRT sequencing method. Then the genome was assembled and annotated. These data could not only assist us in finding 17.93% repetitive elements but also in discovering 171,915 m4C and 11,784 m6A. Using genomic component analysis, gene function annotation and classification, we predicted CAZymes, PHI and TCDB associated with the pathogenicity of citrus sour rot. Additionally, we identified three PG genes related to pathogenesis of G. citri-aurantii and some ABC, MFS and MATE genes related to guazatine resistance. Our work also lays the foundation for future research on this important citrus postharvest disease."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Sour rot, caused by Geotrichum citri-aurantii (Ferraris), is one of the most important fungal diseases of citrus fruit, affecting all species and cultivars in the world [ 1 ]. After being first reported in 1917, this disease has been frequently reported around the world [ 2 ]. During the period of harvest, storage, transport and handling, citrus fruits are exposed to G. citri-aurantii pathogen and can be infected through wounds [ 3 ], especially during rainy seasons. Despite the severe damage caused by G. citri-aurantii , its infection mechanism and genetic information have not been thoroughly elucidated. Many researchers have tried to inhibition citrus sour rot by cistus aqueous extracts, thyme oil, sodium dehydroacetate of chemical control and yeasts of biological control [ 4–7 ]. However, no suitable methods have been found effectively controlling the occurrence and spread of sour rot disease and the genome of G. citri-aurantii is not yet released. Thus, obtaining genome information is one of the main strategies to elucidate pathogen infection mechanisms. It is known that pathogens can secrete a variety of cell wall degrading enzymes when they interact with plants, and Polygalacturonase (PG) is a phytopathogenic factor among the first enzymes degrading plant cell wall secreted by phytopathogenic fungi [ 8 ].Extraordinary, PG could promote infection by some pathogens according to transforming the mechanical strength and rheological properties of the cell wall [ 9 ]. In this study, the change of PG drawn our attention during the interaction between G. citri-aurantii and citrus. And we would explore the PG related genes in the G. citri-aurantii genome. Furthermore, guazatine is the only chemical fungicide that can control sour rot effectively [ 10 ]. As a broad-spectrum bactericidal agent, guazatine plays an important role in the biosynthesis of fungal esters, cell membrane function, and inhibiting spore germination [ 11 ], germ tube elongation and adherent cells and hyphae formation. In recent years, the incidence of sour rot has increased in many citrus-producing areas of China. Simultaneously, the resistance of G. citri-aurantii in citrus-producing areas has increased annually. The above-mentioned reports imply that G. citri-aurantii could adapt to the changing environment flexibly. Therefore, the G. citri-aurantii genome may be helpful for understanding the anti-drug mechanism of G. citri-aurantii , and it is more conducive to finding an effective method to control sour rot instead of traditional fungicides. In previous studies, ATP-binding cassette (ABC), major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporter family genes play a crucial role in the process of fungal resistance. Two ABC transporter family genes, PMR1 and PMR5, mediate 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) fungicide efflux [ 12 ]. The MFS transporter family genes also contributes to fungicide resistance in Penicillium digitatum [ 12 ]. The toxic efflux system consisting of PMR1 is directly involved in DMI resistance of fungi [ 13 ]. Multidrug efflux transporters play important roles in the regulation of fungal resistance to many DMI drugs. At present, in terms of the primary structure and special energy coupling mode, multidrug efflux transporters are categorized into five families. The MATE family is one of these families [ 14 ]. It is reported that ABC transporter family genes, MFS transporter family genes and MATE family genes were proved to evolve resistance to guazatine in P. digitatum genome [ 10 ]. In this study, sequencing of G. citri-aurantii genome and guazatine- treatment transcriptome open the possibility to identify genes that are related to guazatine-resistance mechanism. And the purpose of this study was to get these genes in G. citri-aurantii genome associated with guazatine-resistance. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Fungal strains, culture conditions and DNA extraction A wild-type strain of G. citri-aurantii (AY-1) was isolated from Newhall navel orange in Anyuan city, Jiangxi Province of China. The single spore of G. citri-aurantii was obtained by separation and purification. Finally, the obtained fungus was formulated into a spore suspension and inoculated onto healthy Newhall navel oranges according to the Koch postulate [ 15 ]. The strain was identified as G. citri-aurantii based on the molecular identification of the ITS universal primer (JQ425848.1) and the Blast alignment on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). To obtain the purer mycelia, G. citri-aurantii was cultured on PDA media with a layer of clear cellophane at 25 °C for 5d. Genomic DNA of G. citri-aurantii was extracted by using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method [ 16 ]. 2.2 Genome sequencing, assembly and chromosomal localization by Hi-C The genome of G. citri-aurantii was sequenced by SMRT sequencing method with P6-C4 of the latest upgraded chemical reagents and was assembled using de novo assembly in Biomarker Technologies ( www.biomarker.com.cn ). Then, after a BUSCO analysis, the relationship between the whole chromatin DNA in the whole genome was studied by high-throughput sequencing technology with the Illumina HiSeq platform and Hi-C, which was combined with the biological information analysis method in Biomarker Technologies (Beijing, China). The sequencing read length is up to PE150. 2.3 Genomic component analysis A repetitive sequence library of G. citri-aurantii was constructed based on LTR_FINDER [ 17 ], MITE-Hunter [ 18 ], RepeatScout [ 19 ] and PILER-DF [ 20 ] software. Finally, the repeated sequence prediction of the sequencing data was performed based on the constructed repetitive sequence database using RepeatMasker [ 21 ] software. Gene prediction was performed using de novo prediction, homologous species prediction, and reference-based transcript-based assembly. An increasing number of studies have found that noncoding RNA plays a significant role in the process of microbial infection. Blastn [ 22 ] was used for genome-wide alignment to identify rRNA based on the Rfam [ 23 ] database. tRNAscan-SE [ 24 ] was used to identify tRNA. The functional pseudogenes can be recombined by gene conversion into the respective expression site to create a new variant of each gene. Therefore, the study of pseudogenes is particularly important when gene function is studied. Through BLAST [ 25 ] alignment, a homologous gene sequence (possible gene) is searched for in the genome. GeneWise [ 26 ] is used to find immature stop codons and frameshift mutations in the gene sequence to obtain pseudogenes. 2.4 Genomic function annotation To obtain gene function annotation, the predicted gene sequences were BLAST-matched [ 27 ] with functional databases, such as KOG [ 28 ], KEGG [ 29 ], Swiss-Prot [ 30 ], TrEMBL [ 30 ], and Nr [ 31 ] according to the results of the Nr database comparison, the functional annotation of the GO [ 32 ] database is performed using the software Blast2GO [ 33 ]. Protein-encoding genes were annotated by a combination of three databases: The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) [ 34 ], Pathogen Host Interactions (PHI) [ 35 ] and CAZyme [ 36 ]. 2.5 Whole-genome DNA methylation analysis Based on the results of the de novo assembly, the IPD ratio (the primary metric for kinetic information) was calculated based on the raw data obtained by SMRT sequencing to identify DNA methylation sites [ 37 ]. 2.6 Linearization analysis and phylogenetic analysis The relevant reference sequences of the ITS sequences of strain AY-1 were downloaded in GenBank using ClustalX 2.0.10 software. Sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE, and the phylogenetic tree was generated by MEGA 5.0 using a UPGMA method G. citri-aurantii (PRJNA578961) and G. candidum (PRJNA268631) were analyzed using GATA. 2.7 Extraction and activity determination of the cell wall degrading enzyme in vivo Five microliters of the spore suspension (1.0 × 10 6 spores/mL) of G. citri-aurantii was cultured on PDA medium (potato 200 g, sucrose 20 g, agar powder 15 g, distilled water 1 L) at 25 °C for 3d. The inoculating needle was used to pick the mycelial lump of the colony into the modified Marcus culture medium (KNO 3 2.0 g, KCl 0.5 g, FeSO 4 0.01 g, K 2 HPO 4 1.0 g, MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O 0.5 g, VB1 0.1 mg, L-asparagine 0.5 g, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt 10.0 g, distilled water 1 L, pH 5.0) to be grown at 25 °C and 150 rpm shaking (cellulase culture for 10 d, other enzyme culture for 6 d). This step also induces enzyme production. The hyphae and impurities in the Marcus medium were filtered off by two layers of gauze, and the filtrate was centrifuged twice at 10000 g for 15 min. Then, the supernatant was combined. Next, (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 was gradually added to the supernatant enzyme solution, slightly vortexed to dissolve, and finally brought to 60% saturation (25 °C). The mixture was allowed to sit at 4°Cfor 5 h or overnight. The precipitate was obtained by centrifugation at 12000 g for 15 min. Polygalacturonase (PG), polymethylgalacturonase (PMG) and cellulase (Cx) were dissolved in 20 mL of 50 mmol/L acetic acid‑sodium acetate buffer (pH = 5.0) and dialyzed in the buffer. Polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminating enzyme (PGTE) and Pectin methyl trans-eliminase (PMTE) were treated with 20 mL of 50 mmol/L glycine-NaOH buffer (pH =9.0), and the precipitate was dissolved and dialyzed in the buffer. The dialysate was changed once every 12 h for a total of 3 dialysis cycles, and the enzyme purified by dialysis was stored at −20 °C. The spore suspension (1.0 × 10 6 spores/mL) of G. citri-aurantii was inoculated into mature Newhall navel orange ( Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) (and stored for 72 h at 25 °C and 95% RH. The peel sample was taken down with a scalpel around the diseased part of the fruit. In the same way, five cell wall degrading enzymes were extracted and purified. According to the absorbance value (OD value) of the reducing sugar released by the enzyme reaction, the activity of polygalacturonase (PG), polymethylgalacturonase (PMG), Cellulase (Cx), polygalacturonic acid transeliminase (PGTE) and pectinmethyltranseliminase (PMTE) were measured by a UV2450 spectrophotometer in vitro and in vivo. However, in vivo, the sampling time points were set to 36 h, 48 h, 60 h, 72 h, 84 h and 96 h. 2.8 Transcriptome analysis and quantitative RT-PCR The spores and hyphae of the wild G. citri-aurantii (AY-1) were used as a control group for drug resistance transcriptome analysis. G. citri-aurantii (AY1-68) is a guazatine-resistant strain with an EC 50 value of 6.3793 mg/L. However, the wild G. citri-aurantii is sensitive to guazatine with an EC 50 value of 0.0487 mg/L. G. citri-aurantii and the strain AY1-68 were cultured on PDA medium at 25 °C. Then, 20 μl of a conidial suspension (10 6 spores/mL) of G. citri-aurantii and strain AY1-68 were cultured in 100 mL PDB medium (extract of 200 g potato boiled water and 20 g dextrose) at 25 °C for 72 h, respectively. Then, guazatine (6.3793 mg/L) was added to PDB with shaking for an additional 6 h after being cultured at 25 °C for 48 h. Other groups were added with the same volume of sterile water as a control. The experiment was repeated three times. The samples were as follows: G0 (AY-1 VS AY-1 after the guazatine treatment); G1 (AY-1 VS AY1-68); G2 (AY1-68 VS AY1-68 after the guazatine treatment). The mycelia were filtered and washed several times using double distilled water. All samples were frozen at −80 °C before transcriptome sequencing. Each treatment had three biological replicates. The downloaded data from instrument were filtered to obtain clean data, sequence alignment with the specified reference genome [38], the obtained mapping data, insert length test, randomness test and the other library quality evaluation [ 38 ]. Structural level analysis of alternative splicing analysis, new gene discovery, and genetic structure optimization were performed on the base of the clean data. The differential expression levels of genes were found in different samples or different sample groups, then they were annotated and enriched using GO, KEGG and KOG websites [ 39 ]. Three PG genes, two ABC genes, six MFS genes and two MATE genes were explored in the transcriptome data. RT-PCR was used to compare with the expression of thirteen genes changes in the transcriptome. Total RNA was extracted using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa Biotech. Co., Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was prepared by NovoScript Plus All-in-one 1st strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (gDNA Purge) (Novoprotein, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer's protocol. qRT-PCR was performed using a BIO-RAD CFX96 q-PCR system with SYBR Green I fluorescent dye detection. The mRNA abundance was normalized with the housekeeping gene β-actin, and the relative expression levels were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCt method. 3 Results 3.1 The G. citri-aurantii genome sequencing, assembly and annotation The genome of G. citri-aurantii was sequenced by SMRT. A 20-Kb library was constructed for genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and they were uploaded on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (PRJNA578961). After filtering the original data, a total of 2.54 Gb of high-quality sequencing data was obtained (Supplementary S1A). Assembly led to a genome size of 28.10 Mb (28,101,572 bp) with approximately 90× coverage (Supplementary S1B), and they were divided into 29 scaffolds with a minimum size of 1 Mb after a Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis, as well as an overall G + C content of 38.6% ( Table 1 ). And an overall repeat content of 17.93% of the genome was discovered through RepeatMasker analysis and PASTEClassifier classification. Some characteristics of G. citri-aurantii genome are shown in Table 1 . 6783 genes were predicted by BRAKER software, with an average length of 2058 bp, a gene density of 241 genes/Mb and a total of 46.8% of the genome covered by protein-coding genes. There was an average exon and intron length of 1203 bp and 111 bp. Ten chromosome groups could be clearly distinguished according to the evaluation of Hi-C assembly results ( Fig. 1 B ) and they were displayed by circus plot ( Fig. 1 A). Within each group, the intensity of the interaction at the diagonal position was higher than the position of the nondiagonal line, and the results indicated that the interaction between adjacent sequences (diagonal positions) was higher in the Hi-C assembled chromosome but not in nonadjacent sequences (nondiagonal position), which was consistent with the principle of Hi-C helper genome assembly. After Hi-C assembly, the genome sequence length of 27.94 Mb with 193× coverage was mapped to the 10 chromosome, accounting for 99.43% of the previously measured G. citri-aurantii genome ( Table 1 ). In the genome structure, TEs and repetitive DNA sequences played important roles in the evolution of fungi [ 40 ]. The total repeat sequences of 5,039,960 bp (5 M) were identified, accounting for 17.93% of the G. citri-aurantii total genome, including LTR retrotransposon, DNA transposon, transposon tandem and other unclassified repeat sequences ( Fig. 2 A ). Recently, DNA methylation had also been reported in the class Dothideomycetes [ 41 ]. In G. citri-aurantii genome, 171,537 m4C (4-methyl-cytosine) and 11,765 m6A (6-methyl-adenosine) were identified ( Fig. 2 B). Most of the categorized DNA methylations were m4C. However, m6A DNA methylations occurred with high frequency in the regions of repetitive elements compared with m4C ( Fig. 2 C). Using the predicted protein sequence of the gene to perform BLAST alignment with functional databases, such as the TCDB database and the PHI database, 170 TCDB and 1933 PHI were predicted. Then, 196 CAZyme and 1270 Transmembrane proteins were found through analysis of protein sequences of all predicted genes ( Fig. 2 D). In G. citri-aurantii genome, the protein containing the transmembrane helix was removed from the predicted 339 proteins containing the signal peptide, and the remaining 158 proteins were secreted proteins. Through domain calling analysis, PF14295.4 ( n = 6) is the most abundant domain, which mediates protein/protein interactions. 3.2 Comparative genomic analysis On the one hand, the homology distribution of G. citri-aurantii and Yarrowia Lipolytica reached 36.33% through sequence alignment in the NCBI RefSeq (Nr) database (Supplementary S1C). On the other hand, the evolutionary relationship of G. citri-aurantii and other fungi species was analyzed using a group of phylogenetic backbone genes of the fungi. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that G. citri-aurantii was evolutionarily close to Galactomyces citri-aurantii , a plant pathogen that had been found on citrus fruit or in the soil of citric fruit orchards ( Fig. 3 A ). In addition, G. citri-aurantii was also close to the other two fungi of Dipodascaceae sp. and Geotrichum candidum ( Fig. 3 A). To date, in all fungi in the phylogenetic tree of G. citri-aurantii , only the genome of G. candidum had been published. Synteny analysis of the G. citri-aurantii genome and G. candidum genome revealed that the G. citri-aurantii genome displayed different synteny from G. candidum ( Fig. 3 B, C). 3.3 The analysis of PG genes in G. citri-aurantii genome The plant cell wall was the first barrier of defense against pathogens. Nearly all fungi, particularly necrotrophic pathogens, must initially secrete PGs to dissolve pectin and related components of plant cell wall [ 42–44 ]. In vitro, G. citri-aurantii was induced to produce five cell wall-degrading enzymes, polygalacturonase (PG), polymethylgalacturonase (PMG), cellulase (Cx), polygalacturonic acid transeliminase (PGTE) and pectinmethyltranseliminase (PMTE) ( Fig. 4 A ). PG and PMG have higher activity, and both PGTE and PMTE enzyme activities are less than 1 U/mg in healthy citrus ( Fig. 4 A). However, in the fruit wounds after culturing G. citri-aurantii for 72 h, the activities of only four enzymes of PG, PMG, PGTE and PMTE, were detected. The activity of Cx was zero ( Fig. 4 B). Importantly, the PG activity of the fruit pathological site was significantly higher than that of the healthy part, which is 6.8 times that of the healthy part, and the PMG activity is 1.6 times that of the healthy part. In G. citri-aurantii genome, three PG enzymes had been discovered, and we had identified these genes that produced three proteins: EVM0005942, EVM0004416 and EVM0002276 ( Table 2 ) . After the citrus was infected by G. citri-aurantii , the results showed that the expression levels of these three genes increased greatly through the transcriptome data and the quantitative RT-PCR of the strain AY1-68 with guazatine treatment ( Fig. 4 C), which indicating that these three enzymes played a critical role in the process of G. citri-aurantii infection citrus. 3.4 Transcriptome on the guazatine-resistance of G. citri-aurantii Due to the correlation was greater than 90% between twelve samples ( Fig. 5 A ), the guazatine- resistance transcriptome data (PRJNA578961) was repeatable (Supplementary S2A, B). There were 760 DEGs between the strain AY-1 and AY1-68 before guazatine treatment, and they were used as cutoff values ( Fig. 5 B). Among these genes, 451 genes were upregulated, and 309 genes were downregulated. The results indicated that the gene expression pattern was changed significantly in the resistant strains. After the strain AY1-68 was treated with guazatine, there were 240 DE genes that contained 48 downregulated and 192 upregulated DE genes. To our surprise, there was one co-expressed gene of EVM0003749 between G0 and G2. Therefore, we supposed that EVM0003749 played an important role to the drug response of guazatine. 124 DE genes belonging to the strain AY1-68 were uniquely associated with the resistance of the strain AY1-68 to guazatine, and they were associated with the resistance of the strain AY1-68. All 1005 DE genes were classified by Gene ontology (GO) consortium analysis ( Fig. 5 C). Compared with the wild strain AY-1, the drug-resistant strain AY1-68 could increase its resistance several hundredfold. It is suspected that some of the cellular component organization of this strain had changed to some extent. Simultaneous sequencing revealed that 80% of these genes had increased expression levels of the transcriptome data. These results revealed that the cellular component of the drug-resistant strain AY1-68 changed a lot. To identify genes related to the responses of G. citri-aurantii to the antifungal drug guazatine and the high resistance of G. citri-aurantii , differentially expressed genes of the ABC transporter family and MFS transporter family were further analyzed. In G2 transcriptome data, the expression of the two genes (EVM0003677, EVM0005437) from the ABC transporter family and six transporter genes (EVM0000087, EVM0000766, EVM0001093, EVM0003101, EVM0004095, EVM0005235) from the MFS transporter family made a big difference ( Table 2 ). In this study, RT-qPCR was used to validate the expression levels of eight transporter genes and the results were the same as the G2 transcriptome data ( Fig. 6 A, C ). The expression levels of five genes (EVM0003677, EVM0000087, EVM0003101, EVM0004095 and EVM0005235) were upregulated instead of the expression levels of five genes (EVM0005437, EVM0000766 and EVM0001093) were downregulated. These consequences indicate that overexpression of these genes may enhance the drug resistance of G. citri-aurantii . The G1 transcriptome data analysis revealed that six MATE transporters (EVM0000063, EVM0002368, EVM0001080, EVM0003579, EVM0005976, EVM6710) were related to drug resistance, and these transporter genes were not reported before this study. In the guazatine-resistant strain AY1-68, the expression levels of two MATE genes (EVM0000063, EVM0002368, seeing Table 2 ) were upregulated compared with the guazatine-susceptible strain AY-1 ( Fig. 6 B). The other five MATE genes had decreased expression. Notably, these MATE transporters were normal in AY1-68 after guazatine treatment. These results indicate that two ABC genes and six MFS genes of G. citri-aurantii were activated after guazatine treatment. However, two MATE genes may play a decisive role in enhancing drug resistance. 4 Discussion In postharvest diseases of citrus, the incidence of sour rot caused by G. citri-aurantii has increased annually in various producing areas of China [ 9 ]. Due to the large-scale use of the fungicide guazatine, the proportion of G. citri-aurantii -resistant mutant strains has also increased significantly. To further analyze G. citri-aurantii -resistant mechanism, the G. citri-aurantii genome of the economically important fungi was sequenced by SMRT in our study. The genome size is 28.10 Mb, and 17.93% of the genome is composed of repeat sequences. In particular, ~10 Mb consisted of repetitive sequences and the sequencing amount of a single sequencing cell reached 1 Gb. After Hi-C assembly, the sequence length and direction can be determined to be 27.58 Mb in the sequence mapped to the chromosome, accounting for 98.63% of the total length of the sequence located on the chromosome. In the genome structure, the number of repeats reached 11,476. Interestingly, Rest of genome were the most repeating sequence (82.17%). Notably, LINE and LTR account for 5.1 and 2.31%, respectively. Epigenetics is currently at the forefront in the identification of pathogen-induced modifications within host plants [ 45 ]. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark associated with plant immunity, but little is known about its roles in fungi infection of citrus [ 46 ]. The most studied type of DNA methylation in fungi is m5C, while in prokaryotic cells, it is m4C and m6A. Recently, 171,915 m4C (4-methyl-cytosine) and 11,784 m6A (6-methyl- adenosine) ( Fig. 2 B) in the G. citri-aurantii genome were identified by SMRT for the first time. Surprisingly, large numbers of m4C were observed in G. citri-aurantii . The m4C modification occurs with a higher frequency in the region of repetitive elements in the G. citri-aurantii genome ( Fig. 2 C and D), and the results indicate that m4C may be involved in the transposition of the transposons [ 45 ]. Methylation is one of the major factors to influences the transcription level in mutation. The possible relationship that candidate gene and methylation may be analyzed and explored in mutation AY1-68. Our results also suggest that m4C may be the focus of future research on sour rot. The transcripts were analyzed in accordance to the G. citri-aurantii genome. And all the functions in the genome were also identified in the transcriptome. From the total amount of genes, 3 PGs genes were related to pathogenesis and 814 genes encoded guazatine resistance-related genes. PG was first obtained from pectinase produced by pathogenic fungi by Cooper [ 46 ]. PG is thought to act by degrading homologous polygalactonic acid regions in plant cell walls [ 47 ]. PG is associated with fungal pathogenicity and toxicity by causing tissue degradation and protoplast death [ 48 ]. We found three PG genes in the G. citri-aurantii genome, and RT-qPCR results verified that the expression of three PG genes increased. These data further support the hypothesis that PG can promote G. citri-aurantii to cause citrus disease. The relation of the G. citri-aurantii strong pathogenicity and PG secretion is worth further studying. In a word, we predict that the pathogenicity of G. citri-aurantii will reduce if PGs are deleted, which will provide a new idea to control the sour rot for the future research. In drug resistance research of P. digitatum , further research provided evidence that transporter genes from the ABC transporter family and the MFS transporter family have also contributed to fungicide resistance. Two ABC transporter family genes, PMR1 and PMR5, mediate DMI fungicide efflux [ 49 ]. MATE is a multidrug efflux transporter that plays important roles in intrinsic and acquired resistance in many bacteria and in the regulation of fungi resistance to many DMI drugs [ 50 ]. In the study of G. citri-aurantii resistance, the expression of two genes from the ABC transporter family, six genes from the MFS transporter family and two genes from the MATE transporter family had changed a lot by RT-qPCR. These results attracted our attention to study the resistance of G. citri-aurantii to guazatine. In addition, most of the differentially expressed genes identified were transporter activity, so we speculated that the reason why G. citri-aurantii enhance resistance to guazatine may be mutations in genes related to transportation. This result may indicate the direction for our future research. In summary, we report a complete genome sequence of G. citri-aurantii using the SMRT sequencing method. Then the genome was assembled and annotated. These data could not only assist us in finding 17.93% repetitive elements but also in discovering 171,915 m4C and 11,784 m6A. Using genomic component analysis, gene function annotation and classification, we predicted CAZymes, PHI and TCDB associated with the pathogenicity of citrus sour rot. Additionally, we identified three PG genes related to pathogenesis of G. citri-aurantii and some ABC, MFS and MATE genes related to guazatine resistance. Our work also lays the foundation for future research on this important citrus postharvest disease. 5 Conclusions In summary, a high-quality genome sequence of G. citri-aurantii was obtained. We found 3 PGs genes were related to pathogenesis and 814 genes encoded guazatine resistance-related genes. In all guazatine resistance-related genes, two ABC transporter family genes, six MFS transporter family genes and two MATE transporter family genes play an important role in enhancing resistance. They would serve as potential candidate genes for further studies of pathogenicity and resistance to guazatine.
