    "full_text": "Now-a-days, the isolation and identification of fungi from different natural sources are modern trends for utilizing fungi and fungal products for human welfare. For utilization of the isolated fungi in multifaced area like biocontrol of plant pathogens and pests, anti-cancerous, anti- cholesterol, anti-hyper glycaemic agent or compound isolation, industrial enzyme production, plastic degradation, etc. The proper identification, whole genome sequence, assembly and genome annotation of isolated fungi are now essential task. Our objectives of this present work include isolation of fungus from plastic waste and the proper identification, genome sequence, assembly and annotation including microsatellites analysis of this fungus. A strain of fungus was isolated and purified from plastic wastage and it was molecularly identified as Lasiodiplodia theobromae strain RAH19. Whole genome sequence of our isolated Lasiodiplodia theobromae showed that its genome size was 52.89 Mb consisting of 3476 scaffolds with N 50 length of 778,169 and N 90 length of 5059. The percentages of GC content and repetitive element of our strain were 55.21 % and 0.94 % respectively. The comparative analysis of genome sequence of this strain with other strains of this fungus exhibited that its genomes size was to be larger than other strains like L. theobromae JMB122 (46.93 Mb), L. theobromae LA-SOL3 (43.9 Mb), L. theobromae AM2As (43.7 Mb), L. theobromae CITRA15 (43.3 Mb) and L. theobromae CSS-01S (43.3 Mb). In our strain, the numbers of predicted protein coding genes or total genes were 20,376 but annotated genes were 12,186 and numbers of CAzymes (carbohydrate active enzymes) were 267. Non-CAZyme Transmembrane transporters protein coding genes were annotated and they were 979 and among them MFS transporter was highest (456) followed by ABC transporter (149), amino acid (148), peptide (124), sugar transporters (93), etc. and non-transporter genes were also annotated in the genome of this strain. Microsatellite (SSRs) analysis showed that in our L. theobromae strain RAH19, hexanucleotide repeat was longest bearing average length 35.90 bp, followed by penta- (24.41 bp), di- (19.83 bp), tetra – (18.55 bp), tri – (18.25 bp) and mononucleotide repeats (13.91 bp). Furthermore, we have calculated the total relative abundance (RA) (loci /Mp) and total relative density (RD) (bp/Mb) of perfect SSR of this fungus and have found highest RA in trinucleotide followed by mono-, di-, tetra- and hexanucleotide but lowest was recorded in pentanucleotides. In conclusion, the isolated fungus growing on waste plastic, was one strain of Lasiodiplodia theobromae RAH19 having 52.89 Mb of genome size, 55.21 % of GC content and 0.94 % of repeat nucleotide content. In SSRs of this fungus longest size of nucleotide repeat was hexanucleotide, highest RA of nucleotide was trinucleotide. This draft genome data may be a good source for further research on fungi that are plastic degraders."

          "The first global unicellular eukaryotic genome sequencing was started and completed with fungal sample, Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996 ( Goffeau et al., 1996 ). Subsequently, mycelial multicellular fungal sample like Neurospora crassa ( Galagan et al., 2003 ) and other fungal genomes have been sequenced and annotated, and some are still on the way of sequencing by the advancement of genome sequencing tools and technology. At present, whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing and assembly technologies are applied for fungal genome sequences with unique perfection, accuracy and long-range and short -range contiguity at low cost. These methods represent modern and advanced technology ( Galagan et al., 2005 ). Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a fungus which belongs to the family Botryosphaeriaceae and phylum Ascomycota. The habit of this fungus is either pathogenic to a wide range of host for disease causing like apple ring rot, grapevine canker, Citrus gummosis, peach gummosis and mango dieback ( Zheng et al., 2021 ; Meng et al., 2022 ) or endophyte ( Galsurker et al., 2018 ) or opportunistic pathogen as in Citrus fruit ( Galsurker et al., 2018 ). So, it's important lies on the fact that it is plant destroyer causing several plant diseases. During conduction of a work for isolation of different fungi from different plastic wastes of Khardah municipality, West Bengal for getting a promising plastic degrading fungi, we isolated this fungus from plastic waste (Polyethylene type) and surprising to note that it could grow in polyethylene plastic waste and could also degrade polyethylene plastic for carbon source but in this study we mainly presented the whole genome sequence, assembly, annotation of this fungus along with microsatellite analysis and mentioned the annotated genes that were responsible for plastic degradation.",
          "Till now the genomic information of a few strains of L. theobromae has been reported and they were L. theobromae JMB122 (46.93 Mb) isolated from peach ( Meng et al., 2022 ), L. theobromae AM2As (43.7 Mb) isolated from cacao ( Ali et al., 2020 ), and L. theobromae CITRA15 (43.3 Mb) from Citrus ( Zheng et al., 2021 ) and L. theobromae CSS-01S (43.3 Mb) and L. theobromae LA-SOL3 (43.9 Mb) from grape vine ( Yan et al., 2018 ; Félix et al., 2019 ), and also the related species like Diplodia seriata F98.1 ( Robert-Siegwald et al., 2017 ), D. seriata 86 DS831 ( Morales-Cruz et al., 2015 ), and D. corticola CBS112549 isolated from cork oak ( Fernandes et al., 2014 ). These literatures indicated that the genome of L. theobromae varied among different strains or isolates of this fungus. So, the significance of our regional data of this fungal strain could not be undermined. Here we may cite one example of Fusarium graminearum that have 60 different isolates in North America and can be differentiated by different genes with signatures of selection and accessary genes, advocating that the populations can be adapted with different traits in the agroecosystem ( Emms and Kelly, 2019 ). Now new trends of perfect microsatellite (SSR) type, length and density analysis of different organisms are going on but on fungal species on whole genome scale are very few. The study of SSRs in genomic sequence of this fungus was first time attempted in this article. In our study, the strain of L. theobromae inhabiting in plastic waste is first time reported and its whole genome sequencing and assemble and annotation, and SSR analysis are completely new. Therefore, our objectives of this work include sequencing, assemble and gene annotation of whole genome and SSR analysis of isolated fungus from plastic waste with advanced genome sequencing technology. It will provide further information regarding this fungus for its disease control or its genes responsible for plastic degradation."

              "For whole-genome sequencing, the fungal strain was cultured for 7 days at 28 °C in PDA medium and approximately 60 mg of fresh growing mycelium were harvested. DNA was extracted by CTAB method ( Doyle and Doyle, 1987 ) from the harvested mycelium. DNA QC (quality check) was done where extracted DNA from the samples were subjected to Nano Drop and GEL Check before being taken for further steps. The Nano Drop reading of 260/280 at an ~ value of 1.8 to 2 was used to determine the DNA's quality. The DNA extracted samples were fragmented into fragments into 600 bp length using KAPPA fragmentation method. The fragmented samples were processed for end repair and A-tailing with Hypa peep plus ERAT enzyme mixture. Immediately, after the end repair and A-tailing, the adapter was added and ligated to the end repaired DNA fragments using DNA ligase. Trimming of low-quality bases and adapter removal were performed by Trimgalore 0.6.4. The quality control was done by FastQC v0.11.9 ( Wingett and Andrews, 2018 ). A sliding window of size 4 was fitted to filter the reads. SOAPdenovo2 is a design for short-read assembly which can prepare a de novo draft assembly of genomes. The program is specially produced to assemble Illumina GA short reads. Then, the trimmed and filtered reads were assembled using Soapdenovo2 ( Luo et al., 2012 ). The condition for amplification included i). 40 ng of extracted DNA was used for amplification along with 10pM of each primer, ii). Initial denaturation of DNA was done at 98 °C, iii) 4 Cycles were taken by the following condition, denaturation @ 98 °C for 15 s, annealing @ 60 °C for 30 s, extension @ 72 °C for 30 s and final extension at 72 °C for 1 min and it was hold at 4 °C. Library amplification was done by Illumina primer. Libraries were rectified utilizing Ampure beads and quantified applying Qubit dsDNA High sensitivity assay kit. Sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq 4000. The choice of size of product for the sequencing was on the basis of 0.7× (>450 bp). To decrease this in SOAPdenovo2, a sparse de Bruijn graph method was applied ( Ye et al., 2012 ), where reads were fragmented into k-mers (<63/ <127 bp) and many linear unique k-mers were clubbed as a group but not kept independently. So, SOAPdenovo2 could cover near about 94.5 % of the reference genome. The assembled reads were mapped against the reference genome for gap closing using Ragtag V2.1.0 ( Alonge et al., 2021 ), https://github.com/malonge/RagTag ). Secondary assembly statistics was tabulated."

Cultural characteristics in PDA medium and microscopical characteristics including scanning electron microscopical features were displayed in the Fig. 1 . The data of phenotypical characters were not shown here. The fasta file of nucleotide sequence was submitted in NCBI data base and published (accession No: PP035149). The whole genome sequence of raw data (fastq file format) of Lasiodiplodia theobromae RAH19 was submitted in SRA database (NCBI) and its accession number was PRJNA1071518 (Bioproject ID: PRJNA1071518 and Biosample accession No SAMN39692340) ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA1071518 ).",
          "Approximately 71 million Illumina reads (with depth of 1916.91×) were used for assembly in SOAPdenovo software, resulting in a genome size of 52.89 Mb. The current genome assembly of L. theobromae strain RAH19 consists of 3476 scaffolds with N 50 length of 778,169, N 90 length of 5059, GC content of 55.21 % and repeat content of 0.94 %. For qualitative assessment of genome completeness, BUSCO analysis was conducted that indicated our strain of L. theobromae contained 99.20 % of examined loci (95.2 % complete genes and 0.1 % fragmented genes). The gene density was 0.561 which indicated that the coding regions of these predicted genes made up 56.1 % of the whole genome ( Table 1 ). We have made a comparative genome analysis where our stain genome was compared with other strains of this fungus which were down loaded from genome data base and literature published so far ( Table 2 ). The present results indicated that genome size of this strain was found to be larger than other strains like L. theobromae JMB122 (46.93 Mb) ( Meng et al., 2022 ), L. theobromae LA-SOL3 (43.9 Mb) ( Félix et al., 2019 ), L. theobromae AM2As (43.7 Mb) ( Ali et al., 2020 ), and L. theobromae CITRA15 (43.3 Mb) ( Zheng et al., 2021 ) and L. theobromae CSS-01S (43.3 Mb) ( Yan et al., 2018 ). GC content of the L. theobromae AM2As genome was 54.73 % ( Ali et al., 2020 ), while our strain had GC content of 55.21 %. Very recently, Meng et al. (2022) reported that L. theobromae MB122 had 6.3 M scaffold size and 4.65 MB of N 50 value while our strain showed scaffold 3476 bp and 0.77 Mb of N 50 length, on the other hand Ali et al. (2020) reported that N 50 length of L. theobromae AM2As was 0.87 Mb. The gene density was calculated and it was 0.561 which indicated the coding regions of these predicted genes covered 56.1 % of the whole genome.",
          "The annotation exhibited that total numbers of genes or predicted protein coding genes in our strain were 20,376, annotated gene numbers were 12,186, unannotated gene numbers were 8190, and CAzymes (carbohydrate active enzymes) were 267 ( Table 1 ). It was striking to note that predicted protein coding genes (20376) of this strain were more than other strains like L. theobromae AM2As ( Ali et al., 2020 ) (13,061) , L. theobromae CSS-01S ( Yan et al., 2018 ) (12,902), L. theobromae LA-SOL3 ( Félix et al., 2019 ) (12785), L. theobromae JMB122 ( Meng et al., 2022 ) (12, 289) and L. theobromae ( Zheng et al., 2021 ) (10, 496) ( Table 2 ).",
          "GO (Gene ontogeny) analysis showed that 43 % of genes were engaged for molecular function, while 31 % and 26 % were for cellular components and biological processes respectively ( Fig. 2 ). It also exhibited that total 14,362 (70.48 %) genes ( Table 1 ) were annotated by GO, and the top four categories of GO with the highest number were binding, catalytic activity, metabolic process and cellular process. In this study COG functional classification was done by COGclassifier. There were 26 categories of COG functional class along with other sub-categories as well ( Fig. 3 ). There were 11,875 genes annotated by COG analysis, and out of 11,875, maximum genes were involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism (1397) and ammino acid transport and metabolism (1069) followed by translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (877), lipid transport and metabolism (819), energy production and conversion (802), etc. but functions of 334 genes were unknown ( Fig. 3 ). KEGG analysis annotated 5006 genes, out of them maximum genes were involved in metabolism ( Fig. 4 ). Meng et al. (2022) reported 7450 genes (60.62 %) by GO analysis and 3666 genes (29.83 %) by KEGG analysis, 9696 genes (78.90 %) by COG analysis in their strain of L. theobromae . Similarly, functional annotation of L. theobromae CSS-01 s exhibited that among the 12,902 predicted genes, 7149 (55.4 %) genes were annotated by GO and 5520 genes were annotated by the KEGG pathway database ( Yan et al., 2018 ).",
          "CAZymes (Carbohydrate active enzymes) of fungi have a significant function in the decomposition of organic substances and also degradation of plant cell walls, or modification of oligo- and polysaccharides during infection to host ( Morales-Cruz et al., 2015 ; Chethana et al., 2016 ). In general, CAZymes are categorized into five families like glycoside hydrolases (GH), glycosyl transferases (GT), polysaccharide lyases (PL); carbohydrate esterases (CE), and auxiliary activities (AA) and an associated module (carbohydrate-binding modules, CBMs). From our work, a total of 267 CAZyme genes/ proteins were annotated in the genome of L. theobromae RAH19 which contained 101 glycosyl transferases (GTs), 140 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 06 carbohydrate esterases (CEs), 5 polysaccharide lyase (PLs), 8 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and 5 auxiliary activities enzyme (AAs) ( Fig. 5 ). Other workers reported CAzymes including family of GT, GH, AA, CBM, PL, CEs, etc. In other strains of this fungus ( L. theobromae JMB122), the numbers of CAZymes were 525 ( Meng et al., 2022 ). Some members of GH families (like GH5, GH6 and GH7) were reported to be for digestion of cellulose and similarly some such as GH3, GH10 and GH43 were recorded for hemicellulose digestion and they were noted in the genome of our strain of L. theobromae . In case of Lasiodiplodia theobromae LA-SOL3 genome encoded 667 extracellular proteins. The enzymes were oxidoreductase, transferase or hydrolase functions, and secreted enzymes were mainly hydrolases. Other enzymes were also detected, such as lyases, isomerases and ligases ( Félix et al., 2019 ). Near about 157 secreted proteins of our strain were predicted (Supplementary Table S1). Transferase activity (70) was found to be most abundant molecular function of the secretome, other GO terms over-represented among the secreted proteins include aspartic type endopeptidase activity (25), phosphatase activity (23), isomerase activity (12), triglyceride lipase activity (7), hydrolase activity, acting on glycosyl bonds (6), hydrolase activity (4), carboxylic ester hydrolase activity (4), lysophospholipase activity (4), oxidoreductase activity acting on a sulphur group of donors (1), and UDP-glycosyltransferase activity (1) (Supplementary Table S1). For host- pathogen interaction, microbes usually produce a number of proteins, enzymes, toxins, hormones, and antimicrobial peptides and the secretory proteins are of importance for pathogenicity ( Lo Presti et al., 2015 ).",
          "Repetitive elements present in the genomes of the family Botryosphaeriaceae ranged from 3.02 to 3.84 %. Among the different strains of this L. theobromae , the repetitive elements ranged from 0.05 to 3.02 % and it was 0.94 % in our strain that indicated that it also restored within this range ( Table 2 ). Literature survey exhibited that the percentages of repetitive element of other fungal pathogens were more than this strain. For examples, Ustilago virens had 25 % ( Zhang et al., 2014 ), N. crassa had 12.72 % ( Galagan et al., 2003 ) and Magnaporthe oryzae had 11.75 % ( Xue et al., 2012 ; Yan et al., 2018 ).",
          "ABC Transporter family and MFS (the major facilitator super) family transporters were abundant among membrane transporter ( Beseli et al., 2015 ). In our strain of L. theobromae , MFS and ABC transporters were 456 and 149 in number respectively and other transporters were also noted (Supplementary Table S2). According to Yan et al. (2018) , L. theobromae genome encoded 917 numbers of membrane transporters and had the largest number of membrane transporters compared with the other taxa ( Yan et al., 2018 ) but interesting to note that in our strain total membrane transporters were 979 which exceeded previous reports (917, Yan et al., 2018 ). Similarly, Ali et al. (2020) reported that L. theobromae contained 827 membrane transporter proteins but MFS transporters being the largest group. In our strain total membrane transporters were 979 where MFS were highest in numbers (456) (Supplementary Table S2). Other membrane transporters in the L. theobromae genome were sugar porters, amino acid/choline transporters, drug: Hþ antiporter-2, multidrug resistance exporters and the PDR (pleiotropic drug resistance) transporters, anion: cation symporters ( Yan et al., 2018 ). It has been noted that after host interaction, some membrane transporters of fungi like sugar transporters, PDRs, amino acid transporters, and triose-phosphate transporters, were significantly up-regulated. The multidrug resistance proteins in the PDR family gave resistance to antifungal chemicals (e.g., azole) and cycloheximide ( Vankuyk et al., 2004 ), and they became up-regulated. It was noted that sugar transporters permit the fungus to grow at different pH situation ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). Membrane transporter (ABC and MFS transporters) of pathogenic fungi has been reported to have a great role for pathogenecity and survival and to protect from host defense mechanism ( Perlin et al., 2014 ). They uptake host-derived resources like carbohydrates or peptides by membrane transporters. Fungi also constantly eliminated phytotoxins or xenobiotics by use of some transmembrane, otherwise they failed to survive or grow in critical condition ( Ali et al., 2020 ).",
          "The notable proteins were recorded like peptidases, oxido-reductase, cell wall proteins, necrosis inducing proteins (NPPs/ NLPs), esterase, pathogenesis associated (PR) proteins, fungal hydrophobins, cytochrome P450s, and chitin synthesis and genes with putative role in phenolic, melanin, protein metabolism ( Paolinelli-Alfonso et al., 2016 ; Meinhardt et al., 2014 ; Bailey et al., 2014 ) were also noted. Whole-genome analysis of our fungal strain exhibited that its genome encoded a wide range of genes like cytochrome P450s (157), catalase (11), cutinase (10), peptidase (495), protease (44), amidase (70), oxidoreductase (dehydrogenase, 66, peroxidase, 51, p450, 363, dioxygenase, 108, monooxygenase, 43), esterase (208), tannase (24), CFEM domain-containing protein (2), lipase (101), cell wall proteins (6), Gpi anchored cell wall organization ccm 33 (3), chitin binding protein (2), NLPs or NPPs (13), etc. (Supplementary Table S3). For adaptation of plastic biodegradation, our strain RAH19 have some genes like cytochrome P450s, catalase, cutinase, dehydrogenase, peroxidase, monooxygenase, esterase, etc. which have a great role in plastic biodegradation ( Vaishnav et al., 2024 ; Ghosh and Pal, 2021 ; Bach et al., 2013 ). Four hydrophobin genes that encoded hydrophobin proteins which help to attach mycelium or spore on host surface or hydrophobic surface (like waxy leaf, plastic, etc) have been found in this genome. In addition, 15 pr1 genes have been recorded in our strain of fungus and PR1 protein has also role in attachment to hydrophobic surface ( Ghosh et al., 2021 ) (Supplementary Table S3).",
          "In addition, other researchers who isolated this fungus from host plants, searched effector proteins. For example, Ali et al. (2020) predicted 115 effector proteins. But in our strain, effector proteins were two in number as our strain was isolated from plastic waste. It was lesser than other strains which were isolated from plant host. Infection expresses effector gene that bears a NPP1 domain. Necrosis inducing proteins (NPPs) were triggered at the time of infection and were related with plant cell death ( Fellbrich et al., 2002 ). Moreover, infection expresses CFEM (Common in Fungal Extracellular Membrane). In our strain, CFEM (2) domains were also noted in our strain as like other strain of this fungus ( Ali et al., 2020 ).",
          "Ali et al. (2020) reported the non-CAZyme and non-effector secreted protein coding genes of L. theobromae like proteases/peptidases (78 genes), oxidases/reductases (60 genes), tannase feruloyl esterase genes (4 genes), etc. These genes have a role in sterol biosynthesis, degradation of lignin and breakdown of environmental contaminants ( van den Brink et al., 1998 ). Similarly, tannase feruloyl esterase has a function in lignin degradation ( Dilokpimol et al., 2016 ). Besides these genes with known putative functions, some genes encoded hypothetical proteins (14), have been found in our strain L. theobromae RAH19. Similarly, Ali et al. (2020) also noted hypothetical proteins / genes (240) but their detail study was not done by these workers.",
          "Simple sequence repeat (SSR) or microsatellite signifies the repeats of base pairs having 1–6 bp in length of DNA. The use of SSR in genetic diversity, population genetics, and genetic markers of many organisms has been noted. However, a few works have been performed on individual fungal SSRs at WGS level ( Wöstemeyer and Kreibich, 2002 ). Most probably, the cause of it may be due to the lack of genomic DNA sequence of fungi in databases. In addition, SSR is significant for study of gene expression, and that polymorphism of SSR loci has important function in the analysis of gene regulation ( Meloni et al., 1998 ; Croager et al., 2000 ; Li et al., 2009 ). We have tried to estimate the SSRs by taking 1 Mb length of each set of sequences meant as a reference. As per literature survey, our work on SSRs of this fungus L. theobromae was first time work. The total perfect SSR count across genome sequences of our strain of the fungus was 4134. Total length of perfect SSR was 72,158. The relative density (RD) and relative abundance (RA) of perfect SSRs were 1373.56 and 78.69 respectively. The percentage of perfect SSRs over the genome was 0.14 % (Supplementary Table S4).",
          "In general, mono- and dinucleotide repeats were longer SSRs in maximum genome sequence, and pentanucleotide repeats were the shortest ones ( Li et al., 2009 ). In our L. theobromae , hexanucleotide repeat was longest bearing average length 35.9, followed by penta- (24.41), di- (19,83), tetra –(18.55), tri –(18.25) and mononucleotide repeats (13.91) (Supplementary Table S5). If we go through other fungi, we found that hexanucleotide repeats were longest in C. cinereus but in Fusarium graminearum, Magnaporthe grisea and Ustilago maydis , dinucleotide repeats were the longest SSR, while mononucleotide repeats were longest in Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa , and tetranucleotide repeats were longest in C. neoformans ( Li et al., 2009 ). Regarding the percentage (%) of type of SSR, trinucleotide repeat was highest (47.94 %) followed by mono-(35.37 %), di-(7,26 %), tetra-(4.79 %) and hexa-(2.81 %), and lowest percentage (1.84 %) was in case of pentanucleotide (Supplementary Table S5). According to Mahfooz et al. (2017) , in A. nidulans and A. terreus , tri-nucleotide repeats exhibited the maximum percentages of SSRs and they were 38.25 and 42.15 % respectively while percentages of tetra-nucleotide repeats were 32.0 and 30.7 % respectively. In their results, percentages of dinucleotide repeats of those two fungi were 6.3 and 8.1 %; respectively. SSR length distribution of each type was calculated and presented in pie chart ( Fig. 6 ) where trinucleotide percentage was maximum (50.1 %) followed by mono-(28.2 %), di-(8,24 %) and lowest was Penta (2.57 %). Similarly, SSRs count distribution of each type was calculated and data were presented in Fig. 7 . Same trend was found here. The graphical presentation of SSR length distribution for each SSR type was also shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 .",

          "Furthermore, we have calculated the total relative abundance (RA) (loci /Mp) and total relative density (RD) (bp/Mb) of perfect SSR of this fungus. We have found highest RA in trinucleotide (37.73) followed by mono-(27.83), di-(5.71), tetra- (3.77) and hexa-(2.21) but lowest was recorded in pentanucleotides (1.45) (Supplementary Table S5).

    "full_text": "1 Introduction The first global unicellular eukaryotic genome sequencing was started and completed with fungal sample, Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996 ( Goffeau et al., 1996 ). Subsequently, mycelial multicellular fungal sample like Neurospora crassa ( Galagan et al., 2003 ) and other fungal genomes have been sequenced and annotated, and some are still on the way of sequencing by the advancement of genome sequencing tools and technology. At present, whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing and assembly technologies are applied for fungal genome sequences with unique perfection, accuracy and long-range and short -range contiguity at low cost. These methods represent modern and advanced technology ( Galagan et al., 2005 ). Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a fungus which belongs to the family Botryosphaeriaceae and phylum Ascomycota. The habit of this fungus is either pathogenic to a wide range of host for disease causing like apple ring rot, grapevine canker, Citrus gummosis, peach gummosis and mango dieback ( Zheng et al., 2021 ; Meng et al., 2022 ) or endophyte ( Galsurker et al., 2018 ) or opportunistic pathogen as in Citrus fruit ( Galsurker et al., 2018 ). So, it's important lies on the fact that it is plant destroyer causing several plant diseases. During conduction of a work for isolation of different fungi from different plastic wastes of Khardah municipality, West Bengal for getting a promising plastic degrading fungi, we isolated this fungus from plastic waste (Polyethylene type) and surprising to note that it could grow in polyethylene plastic waste and could also degrade polyethylene plastic for carbon source but in this study we mainly presented the whole genome sequence, assembly, annotation of this fungus along with microsatellite analysis and mentioned the annotated genes that were responsible for plastic degradation. Till now the genomic information of a few strains of L. theobromae has been reported and they were L. theobromae JMB122 (46.93 Mb) isolated from peach ( Meng et al., 2022 ), L. theobromae AM2As (43.7 Mb) isolated from cacao ( Ali et al., 2020 ), and L. theobromae CITRA15 (43.3 Mb) from Citrus ( Zheng et al., 2021 ) and L. theobromae CSS-01S (43.3 Mb) and L. theobromae LA-SOL3 (43.9 Mb) from grape vine ( Yan et al., 2018 ; Félix et al., 2019 ), and also the related species like Diplodia seriata F98.1 ( Robert-Siegwald et al., 2017 ), D. seriata 86 DS831 ( Morales-Cruz et al., 2015 ), and D. corticola CBS112549 isolated from cork oak ( Fernandes et al., 2014 ). These literatures indicated that the genome of L. theobromae varied among different strains or isolates of this fungus. So, the significance of our regional data of this fungal strain could not be undermined. Here we may cite one example of Fusarium graminearum that have 60 different isolates in North America and can be differentiated by different genes with signatures of selection and accessary genes, advocating that the populations can be adapted with different traits in the agroecosystem ( Emms and Kelly, 2019 ). Now new trends of perfect microsatellite (SSR) type, length and density analysis of different organisms are going on but on fungal species on whole genome scale are very few. The study of SSRs in genomic sequence of this fungus was first time attempted in this article. In our study, the strain of L. theobromae inhabiting in plastic waste is first time reported and its whole genome sequencing and assemble and annotation, and SSR analysis are completely new. Therefore, our objectives of this work include sequencing, assemble and gene annotation of whole genome and SSR analysis of isolated fungus from plastic waste with advanced genome sequencing technology. It will provide further information regarding this fungus for its disease control or its genes responsible for plastic degradation. 2 Methods 2.1 Fungal strain isolation, purification and phenotypically characterization and identification The fungal strain was isolated in PDA (potato dextrose agar) medium at 28 °C temperature in a BOD incubator from surface of plastic waste collected from dumping ground of Khardah, 24-Parganas (N), West Bengal. This fungus was phenotypically (morphologically and microscopically) identified consulting with published keys and manuals ( Goura et al., 2022 ; Nagamani et al., 2006 ; Davet and Rouxel, 2000 ; Domsch et al., 1980 ). 2.2 Molecular characterization and identification Genomic DNA (gDNA) of the fungal strain was extracted by CTAB method (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) ( Doyle and Doyle, 1987 ). gDNA extracted from this fungal strain was subjected to amplify specific marker gene ITSs , applying the primers ITS1 and ITS 4 ( Ghosh et al., 2022 ), This PCR product was visualized in gel electrophoresis and their purity was checked and sent for sequencing to Biokart lab., Bangalore, and FASTA file was obtained and loaded on NCBI data base for BLASTn and its alignment was matched with the sequence (100 % similarity and >90 % quarry coverage) in databases and it was taken for identification of the fungal species. After identification of this fungus, the nucleotide sequence of ITSs of r DNA was submitted in NCBI nucleotide data bank and published with accession no. 2.3 Whole genome sequencing and assembly For whole-genome sequencing, the fungal strain was cultured for 7 days at 28 °C in PDA medium and approximately 60 mg of fresh growing mycelium were harvested. DNA was extracted by CTAB method ( Doyle and Doyle, 1987 ) from the harvested mycelium. DNA QC (quality check) was done where extracted DNA from the samples were subjected to Nano Drop and GEL Check before being taken for further steps. The Nano Drop reading of 260/280 at an ~ value of 1.8 to 2 was used to determine the DNA's quality. The DNA extracted samples were fragmented into fragments into 600 bp length using KAPPA fragmentation method. The fragmented samples were processed for end repair and A-tailing with Hypa peep plus ERAT enzyme mixture. Immediately, after the end repair and A-tailing, the adapter was added and ligated to the end repaired DNA fragments using DNA ligase. Trimming of low-quality bases and adapter removal were performed by Trimgalore 0.6.4. The quality control was done by FastQC v0.11.9 ( Wingett and Andrews, 2018 ). A sliding window of size 4 was fitted to filter the reads. SOAPdenovo2 is a design for short-read assembly which can prepare a de novo draft assembly of genomes. The program is specially produced to assemble Illumina GA short reads. Then, the trimmed and filtered reads were assembled using Soapdenovo2 ( Luo et al., 2012 ). The condition for amplification included i). 40 ng of extracted DNA was used for amplification along with 10pM of each primer, ii). Initial denaturation of DNA was done at 98 °C, iii) 4 Cycles were taken by the following condition, denaturation @ 98 °C for 15 s, annealing @ 60 °C for 30 s, extension @ 72 °C for 30 s and final extension at 72 °C for 1 min and it was hold at 4 °C. Library amplification was done by Illumina primer. Libraries were rectified utilizing Ampure beads and quantified applying Qubit dsDNA High sensitivity assay kit. Sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq 4000. The choice of size of product for the sequencing was on the basis of 0.7× (>450 bp). To decrease this in SOAPdenovo2, a sparse de Bruijn graph method was applied ( Ye et al., 2012 ), where reads were fragmented into k-mers (<63/ <127 bp) and many linear unique k-mers were clubbed as a group but not kept independently. So, SOAPdenovo2 could cover near about 94.5 % of the reference genome. The assembled reads were mapped against the reference genome for gap closing using Ragtag V2.1.0 ( Alonge et al., 2021 ), https://github.com/malonge/RagTag ). Secondary assembly statistics was tabulated. 2.4 Gene annotation The quality of genome was determined utilizing BUSCO version v4.0.2 based on lineage-specific profile library eurotiomycetes_odb10 ( Simão et al., 2015 ). Genome annotation was done utilizing the based on GeneMarkES v 4.48 ( Borodovsky et al., 2003 ). The resulting GTF file was further used to extract the individual gene sequence. The Blast annotation was performed against all the known gene sequences of species Lasiodiplodia theobromae. RepeatMasker version 4.1.5 ( Smit et al., 2013 ), default mode run with rmblastn version 2.13.0+ FamDB: CONS-Dfam_3.7 was used to predict repeats. BLASTKOALA tool ( El-Gebali et al., 2019 ; Huerta-Cepas et al., 2017 ) was used to perform the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis). COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins) functional classification was done by COGclassifier1.0.5 ( https://pypi.org/project/cogclassifier/ ). We performed GO analyses directly from the GOC website ( https://gene ontology.org /) or Uniport Gene Ontology database. This service connected to the analysis tool from the PANTHER Classification System, which was up- graded to date with GO annotations ( https://geneontology.org/ ). The annotation for carbohydrate-active enzymes was performed by the web-based dbCAN2 meta server (supported by ≥2 tools) ( Zhang et al., 2018 ). The clustering of Protein orthogroups was done applying the OrthoFinder software along with an all-versus-all protein BLAST search (e-value < 1e-20, identity > 60 %) ( Emms and Kelly, 2019 ). The program EffectorP 2.0458 ( Sperschneider et al., 2018 ) was used to predict effector proteins. 2.5 SSRs (simple sequence repeats) mining The minimum repeats for each perfect SSR type were set to 12 for Mono-, 7 for Di-, 5 for Tri, 4 for Tetra-, 4 for Penta-, 4 for Hexa-, and motif standardization level was set to Level 3. The frequency or occurrence, density, and relative abundance of SSRs were analysed. The density was determined by dividing the number of base pairs contributed by each SSR by total length analysed (Mb). The relative abundance was measured as the number of SSRs per Mb of a sequence. While scanning di- to hexanucleotide SSRs, combinations involving runs of the same nucleotide were taken into consideration. In the current analysis, each SSR was considered as unique. 3 Results and discussion The isolated fungus was identified as Lasiodiplodia theobromae RAH19 on the basis of ITS1 5.8S ITS2 (marker) and also by phenotypical characters ( Nagamani et al., 2006 ; Domsch et al., 1980 ). Cultural characteristics in PDA medium and microscopical characteristics including scanning electron microscopical features were displayed in the Fig. 1 . The data of phenotypical characters were not shown here. The fasta file of nucleotide sequence was submitted in NCBI data base and published (accession No: PP035149). The whole genome sequence of raw data (fastq file format) of Lasiodiplodia theobromae RAH19 was submitted in SRA database (NCBI) and its accession number was PRJNA1071518 (Bioproject ID: PRJNA1071518 and Biosample accession No SAMN39692340) ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA1071518 ). Approximately 71 million Illumina reads (with depth of 1916.91×) were used for assembly in SOAPdenovo software, resulting in a genome size of 52.89 Mb. The current genome assembly of L. theobromae strain RAH19 consists of 3476 scaffolds with N 50 length of 778,169, N 90 length of 5059, GC content of 55.21 % and repeat content of 0.94 %. For qualitative assessment of genome completeness, BUSCO analysis was conducted that indicated our strain of L. theobromae contained 99.20 % of examined loci (95.2 % complete genes and 0.1 % fragmented genes). The gene density was 0.561 which indicated that the coding regions of these predicted genes made up 56.1 % of the whole genome ( Table 1 ). We have made a comparative genome analysis where our stain genome was compared with other strains of this fungus which were down loaded from genome data base and literature published so far ( Table 2 ). The present results indicated that genome size of this strain was found to be larger than other strains like L. theobromae JMB122 (46.93 Mb) ( Meng et al., 2022 ), L. theobromae LA-SOL3 (43.9 Mb) ( Félix et al., 2019 ), L. theobromae AM2As (43.7 Mb) ( Ali et al., 2020 ), and L. theobromae CITRA15 (43.3 Mb) ( Zheng et al., 2021 ) and L. theobromae CSS-01S (43.3 Mb) ( Yan et al., 2018 ). GC content of the L. theobromae AM2As genome was 54.73 % ( Ali et al., 2020 ), while our strain had GC content of 55.21 %. Very recently, Meng et al. (2022) reported that L. theobromae MB122 had 6.3 M scaffold size and 4.65 MB of N 50 value while our strain showed scaffold 3476 bp and 0.77 Mb of N 50 length, on the other hand Ali et al. (2020) reported that N 50 length of L. theobromae AM2As was 0.87 Mb. The gene density was calculated and it was 0.561 which indicated the coding regions of these predicted genes covered 56.1 % of the whole genome. The annotation exhibited that total numbers of genes or predicted protein coding genes in our strain were 20,376, annotated gene numbers were 12,186, unannotated gene numbers were 8190, and CAzymes (carbohydrate active enzymes) were 267 ( Table 1 ). It was striking to note that predicted protein coding genes (20376) of this strain were more than other strains like L. theobromae AM2As ( Ali et al., 2020 ) (13,061) , L. theobromae CSS-01S ( Yan et al., 2018 ) (12,902), L. theobromae LA-SOL3 ( Félix et al., 2019 ) (12785), L. theobromae JMB122 ( Meng et al., 2022 ) (12, 289) and L. theobromae ( Zheng et al., 2021 ) (10, 496) ( Table 2 ). GO (Gene ontogeny) analysis showed that 43 % of genes were engaged for molecular function, while 31 % and 26 % were for cellular components and biological processes respectively ( Fig. 2 ). It also exhibited that total 14,362 (70.48 %) genes ( Table 1 ) were annotated by GO, and the top four categories of GO with the highest number were binding, catalytic activity, metabolic process and cellular process. In this study COG functional classification was done by COGclassifier. There were 26 categories of COG functional class along with other sub-categories as well ( Fig. 3 ). There were 11,875 genes annotated by COG analysis, and out of 11,875, maximum genes were involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism (1397) and ammino acid transport and metabolism (1069) followed by translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (877), lipid transport and metabolism (819), energy production and conversion (802), etc. but functions of 334 genes were unknown ( Fig. 3 ). KEGG analysis annotated 5006 genes, out of them maximum genes were involved in metabolism ( Fig. 4 ). Meng et al. (2022) reported 7450 genes (60.62 %) by GO analysis and 3666 genes (29.83 %) by KEGG analysis, 9696 genes (78.90 %) by COG analysis in their strain of L. theobromae . Similarly, functional annotation of L. theobromae CSS-01 s exhibited that among the 12,902 predicted genes, 7149 (55.4 %) genes were annotated by GO and 5520 genes were annotated by the KEGG pathway database ( Yan et al., 2018 ). CAZymes (Carbohydrate active enzymes) of fungi have a significant function in the decomposition of organic substances and also degradation of plant cell walls, or modification of oligo- and polysaccharides during infection to host ( Morales-Cruz et al., 2015 ; Chethana et al., 2016 ). In general, CAZymes are categorized into five families like glycoside hydrolases (GH), glycosyl transferases (GT), polysaccharide lyases (PL); carbohydrate esterases (CE), and auxiliary activities (AA) and an associated module (carbohydrate-binding modules, CBMs). From our work, a total of 267 CAZyme genes/ proteins were annotated in the genome of L. theobromae RAH19 which contained 101 glycosyl transferases (GTs), 140 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 06 carbohydrate esterases (CEs), 5 polysaccharide lyase (PLs), 8 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and 5 auxiliary activities enzyme (AAs) ( Fig. 5 ). Other workers reported CAzymes including family of GT, GH, AA, CBM, PL, CEs, etc. In other strains of this fungus ( L. theobromae JMB122), the numbers of CAZymes were 525 ( Meng et al., 2022 ). Some members of GH families (like GH5, GH6 and GH7) were reported to be for digestion of cellulose and similarly some such as GH3, GH10 and GH43 were recorded for hemicellulose digestion and they were noted in the genome of our strain of L. theobromae . In case of Lasiodiplodia theobromae LA-SOL3 genome encoded 667 extracellular proteins. The enzymes were oxidoreductase, transferase or hydrolase functions, and secreted enzymes were mainly hydrolases. Other enzymes were also detected, such as lyases, isomerases and ligases ( Félix et al., 2019 ). Near about 157 secreted proteins of our strain were predicted (Supplementary Table S1). Transferase activity (70) was found to be most abundant molecular function of the secretome, other GO terms over-represented among the secreted proteins include aspartic type endopeptidase activity (25), phosphatase activity (23), isomerase activity (12), triglyceride lipase activity (7), hydrolase activity, acting on glycosyl bonds (6), hydrolase activity (4), carboxylic ester hydrolase activity (4), lysophospholipase activity (4), oxidoreductase activity acting on a sulphur group of donors (1), and UDP-glycosyltransferase activity (1) (Supplementary Table S1). For host- pathogen interaction, microbes usually produce a number of proteins, enzymes, toxins, hormones, and antimicrobial peptides and the secretory proteins are of importance for pathogenicity ( Lo Presti et al., 2015 ). Repetitive elements present in the genomes of the family Botryosphaeriaceae ranged from 3.02 to 3.84 %. Among the different strains of this L. theobromae , the repetitive elements ranged from 0.05 to 3.02 % and it was 0.94 % in our strain that indicated that it also restored within this range ( Table 2 ). Literature survey exhibited that the percentages of repetitive element of other fungal pathogens were more than this strain. For examples, Ustilago virens had 25 % ( Zhang et al., 2014 ), N. crassa had 12.72 % ( Galagan et al., 2003 ) and Magnaporthe oryzae had 11.75 % ( Xue et al., 2012 ; Yan et al., 2018 ). ABC Transporter family and MFS (the major facilitator super) family transporters were abundant among membrane transporter ( Beseli et al., 2015 ). In our strain of L. theobromae , MFS and ABC transporters were 456 and 149 in number respectively and other transporters were also noted (Supplementary Table S2). According to Yan et al. (2018) , L. theobromae genome encoded 917 numbers of membrane transporters and had the largest number of membrane transporters compared with the other taxa ( Yan et al., 2018 ) but interesting to note that in our strain total membrane transporters were 979 which exceeded previous reports (917, Yan et al., 2018 ). Similarly, Ali et al. (2020) reported that L. theobromae contained 827 membrane transporter proteins but MFS transporters being the largest group. In our strain total membrane transporters were 979 where MFS were highest in numbers (456) (Supplementary Table S2). Other membrane transporters in the L. theobromae genome were sugar porters, amino acid/choline transporters, drug: Hþ antiporter-2, multidrug resistance exporters and the PDR (pleiotropic drug resistance) transporters, anion: cation symporters ( Yan et al., 2018 ). It has been noted that after host interaction, some membrane transporters of fungi like sugar transporters, PDRs, amino acid transporters, and triose-phosphate transporters, were significantly up-regulated. The multidrug resistance proteins in the PDR family gave resistance to antifungal chemicals (e.g., azole) and cycloheximide ( Vankuyk et al., 2004 ), and they became up-regulated. It was noted that sugar transporters permit the fungus to grow at different pH situation ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). Membrane transporter (ABC and MFS transporters) of pathogenic fungi has been reported to have a great role for pathogenecity and survival and to protect from host defense mechanism ( Perlin et al., 2014 ). They uptake host-derived resources like carbohydrates or peptides by membrane transporters. Fungi also constantly eliminated phytotoxins or xenobiotics by use of some transmembrane, otherwise they failed to survive or grow in critical condition ( Ali et al., 2020 ). The notable proteins were recorded like peptidases, oxido-reductase, cell wall proteins, necrosis inducing proteins (NPPs/ NLPs), esterase, pathogenesis associated (PR) proteins, fungal hydrophobins, cytochrome P450s, and chitin synthesis and genes with putative role in phenolic, melanin, protein metabolism ( Paolinelli-Alfonso et al., 2016 ; Meinhardt et al., 2014 ; Bailey et al., 2014 ) were also noted. Whole-genome analysis of our fungal strain exhibited that its genome encoded a wide range of genes like cytochrome P450s (157), catalase (11), cutinase (10), peptidase (495), protease (44), amidase (70), oxidoreductase (dehydrogenase, 66, peroxidase, 51, p450, 363, dioxygenase, 108, monooxygenase, 43), esterase (208), tannase (24), CFEM domain-containing protein (2), lipase (101), cell wall proteins (6), Gpi anchored cell wall organization ccm 33 (3), chitin binding protein (2), NLPs or NPPs (13), etc. (Supplementary Table S3). For adaptation of plastic biodegradation, our strain RAH19 have some genes like cytochrome P450s, catalase, cutinase, dehydrogenase, peroxidase, monooxygenase, esterase, etc. which have a great role in plastic biodegradation ( Vaishnav et al., 2024 ; Ghosh and Pal, 2021 ; Bach et al., 2013 ). Four hydrophobin genes that encoded hydrophobin proteins which help to attach mycelium or spore on host surface or hydrophobic surface (like waxy leaf, plastic, etc) have been found in this genome. In addition, 15 pr1 genes have been recorded in our strain of fungus and PR1 protein has also role in attachment to hydrophobic surface ( Ghosh et al., 2021 ) (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, other researchers who isolated this fungus from host plants, searched effector proteins. For example, Ali et al. (2020) predicted 115 effector proteins. But in our strain, effector proteins were two in number as our strain was isolated from plastic waste. It was lesser than other strains which were isolated from plant host. Infection expresses effector gene that bears a NPP1 domain. Necrosis inducing proteins (NPPs) were triggered at the time of infection and were related with plant cell death ( Fellbrich et al., 2002 ). Moreover, infection expresses CFEM (Common in Fungal Extracellular Membrane). In our strain, CFEM (2) domains were also noted in our strain as like other strain of this fungus ( Ali et al., 2020 ). Ali et al. (2020) reported the non-CAZyme and non-effector secreted protein coding genes of L. theobromae like proteases/peptidases (78 genes), oxidases/reductases (60 genes), tannase feruloyl esterase genes (4 genes), etc. These genes have a role in sterol biosynthesis, degradation of lignin and breakdown of environmental contaminants ( van den Brink et al., 1998 ). Similarly, tannase feruloyl esterase has a function in lignin degradation ( Dilokpimol et al., 2016 ). Besides these genes with known putative functions, some genes encoded hypothetical proteins (14), have been found in our strain L. theobromae RAH19. Similarly, Ali et al. (2020) also noted hypothetical proteins / genes (240) but their detail study was not done by these workers. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) or microsatellite signifies the repeats of base pairs having 1–6 bp in length of DNA. The use of SSR in genetic diversity, population genetics, and genetic markers of many organisms has been noted. However, a few works have been performed on individual fungal SSRs at WGS level ( Wöstemeyer and Kreibich, 2002 ). Most probably, the cause of it may be due to the lack of genomic DNA sequence of fungi in databases. In addition, SSR is significant for study of gene expression, and that polymorphism of SSR loci has important function in the analysis of gene regulation ( Meloni et al., 1998 ; Croager et al., 2000 ; Li et al., 2009 ). We have tried to estimate the SSRs by taking 1 Mb length of each set of sequences meant as a reference. As per literature survey, our work on SSRs of this fungus L. theobromae was first time work. The total perfect SSR count across genome sequences of our strain of the fungus was 4134. Total length of perfect SSR was 72,158. The relative density (RD) and relative abundance (RA) of perfect SSRs were 1373.56 and 78.69 respectively. The percentage of perfect SSRs over the genome was 0.14 % (Supplementary Table S4). In general, mono- and dinucleotide repeats were longer SSRs in maximum genome sequence, and pentanucleotide repeats were the shortest ones ( Li et al., 2009 ). In our L. theobromae , hexanucleotide repeat was longest bearing average length 35.9, followed by penta- (24.41), di- (19,83), tetra –(18.55), tri –(18.25) and mononucleotide repeats (13.91) (Supplementary Table S5). If we go through other fungi, we found that hexanucleotide repeats were longest in C. cinereus but in Fusarium graminearum, Magnaporthe grisea and Ustilago maydis , dinucleotide repeats were the longest SSR, while mononucleotide repeats were longest in Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa , and tetranucleotide repeats were longest in C. neoformans ( Li et al., 2009 ). Regarding the percentage (%) of type of SSR, trinucleotide repeat was highest (47.94 %) followed by mono-(35.37 %), di-(7,26 %), tetra-(4.79 %) and hexa-(2.81 %), and lowest percentage (1.84 %) was in case of pentanucleotide (Supplementary Table S5). According to Mahfooz et al. (2017) , in A. nidulans and A. terreus , tri-nucleotide repeats exhibited the maximum percentages of SSRs and they were 38.25 and 42.15 % respectively while percentages of tetra-nucleotide repeats were 32.0 and 30.7 % respectively. In their results, percentages of dinucleotide repeats of those two fungi were 6.3 and 8.1 %; respectively. SSR length distribution of each type was calculated and presented in pie chart ( Fig. 6 ) where trinucleotide percentage was maximum (50.1 %) followed by mono-(28.2 %), di-(8,24 %) and lowest was Penta (2.57 %). Similarly, SSRs count distribution of each type was calculated and data were presented in Fig. 7 . Same trend was found here. The graphical presentation of SSR length distribution for each SSR type was also shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 . In general, mono- and dinucleotide repeats were longer SSRs in maximum genome sequence, and pentanucleotide repeats were the shortest ones ( Li et al., 2009 ). In our L. theobromae , hexanucleotide repeat was longest bearing average length 35.9, followed by penta- (24.41), di- (19,83), tetra –(18.55), tri –(18.25) and mononucleotide repeats (13.91) (Supplementary Table S5). If we go through other fungi, we found that hexanucleotide repeats were longest in C. cinereus but in Fusarium graminearum, Magnaporthe grisea and Ustilago maydis , dinucleotide repeats were the longest SSR, while mononucleotide repeats were longest in Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa , and tetranucleotide repeats were longest in C. neoformans ( Li et al., 2009 ). Regarding the percentage (%) of type of SSR, trinucleotide repeat was highest (47.94 %) followed by mono-(35.37 %), di-(7,26 %), tetra-(4.79 %) and hexa-(2.81 %), and lowest percentage (1.84 %) was in case of pentanucleotide (Supplementary Table S5). According to Mahfooz et al. (2017) , in A. nidulans and A. terreus , tri-nucleotide repeats exhibited the maximum percentages of SSRs and they were 38.25 and 42.15 % respectively while percentages of tetra-nucleotide repeats were 32.0 and 30.7 % respectively. In their results, percentages of dinucleotide repeats of those two fungi were 6.3 and 8.1 %; respectively. SSR length distribution of each type was calculated and presented in pie chart ( Fig. 6 ) where trinucleotide percentage was maximum (50.1 %) followed by mono-(28.2 %), di-(8,24 %) and lowest was Penta (2.57 %). Similarly, SSRs count distribution of each type was calculated and data were presented in Fig. 7 . Same trend was found here. The graphical presentation of SSR length distribution for each SSR type was also shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Furthermore, we have calculated the total relative abundance (RA) (loci /Mp) and total relative density (RD) (bp/Mb) of perfect SSR of this fungus. We have found highest RA in trinucleotide (37.73) followed by mono-(27.83), di-(5.71), tetra- (3.77) and hexa-(2.21) but lowest was recorded in pentanucleotides (1.45) (Supplementary Table S5). Mahfooz et al. (2017) recorded that in case of A. niger and A. oryzae , RA of tetra-nucleotide was 36.7 and 35.9 % respectively but in case of tri-nucleotide repeats they were 35.7 and 30.1 % respectively. Workers found that RA of hexanucleotide repeats in A. niger and A. oryzae showed the least RA (7.5 and 10.0 % respectively) ( Mahfooz et al., 2017 ). While comparing the most abundant motif, they observed that tri-nucleotide motif aag/ctt was the most favoured motif in the genome of A. nidulans . Similarly, A. terreus genome showed preference for another tri-nucleotide repeat cgc/gcg (2.52 %). Dinucleotide repeat motif ga/tc (2.92 %) was the most abundant motif in A. niger genome whereas A. oryzae preferred tetranucleotide repeat motif gaaa/tttc (2.64 %) ( Mahfooz et al., 2017 ). In our study, the abundance of each motif was analysed and the results exhibited that mononucleotide motif “a” was maximum percentage (33.5 %) followed by trinucleotide (6.77 %) “acc “and same trends in case of RA and RD were noted (Supplementary Table S6), and the most abundant motif categories were shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 . SSR repeats distribution for each SSR type was presented in Supplementary Fig. S3 and abundance of each repeat was also tabulated in Supplementary Table S7 where count, length (bp), percent, RA and RD were displayed. Usually, perfect microsatellite repeat ratio was decreased with motif length in maximum fungal genomes studied. The difference in ratio of perfect SSRs in different fungi species has been noted, and general relationship between the ratio and overall SSR loci and similarly between ratio of perfect SSR and genome size have not been noticed. In case of Fusarium graminearum, genome size was larger and SSR was least while perfect SSR repeats were the highest in ratio ( Li et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, we have calculated the total relative abundance (RA) (loci /Mp) and total relative density (RD) (bp/Mb) of perfect SSR of this fungus. We have found highest RA in trinucleotide (37.73) followed by mono-(27.83), di-(5.71), tetra- (3.77) and hexa-(2.21) but lowest was recorded in pentanucleotides (1.45) (Supplementary Table S5). Mahfooz et al. (2017) recorded that in case of A. niger and A. oryzae , RA of tetra-nucleotide was 36.7 and 35.9 % respectively but in case of tri-nucleotide repeats they were 35.7 and 30.1 % respectively. Workers found that RA of hexanucleotide repeats in A. niger and A. oryzae showed the least RA (7.5 and 10.0 % respectively) ( Mahfooz et al., 2017 ). While comparing the most abundant motif, they observed that tri-nucleotide motif aag/ctt was the most favoured motif in the genome of A. nidulans . Similarly, A. terreus genome showed preference for another tri-nucleotide repeat cgc/gcg (2.52 %). Dinucleotide repeat motif ga/tc (2.92 %) was the most abundant motif in A. niger genome whereas A. oryzae preferred tetranucleotide repeat motif gaaa/tttc (2.64 %) ( Mahfooz et al., 2017 ). In our study, the abundance of each motif was analysed and the results exhibited that mononucleotide motif “a” was maximum percentage (33.5 %) followed by trinucleotide (6.77 %) “acc “and same trends in case of RA and RD were noted (Supplementary Table S6), and the most abundant motif categories were shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. SSR repeats distribution for each SSR type was presented in Supplementary Fig. S3 and abundance of each repeat was also tabulated in Supplementary Table S7 where count, length (bp), percent, RA and RD were displayed. Usually, perfect microsatellite repeat ratio was decreased with motif length in maximum fungal genomes studied. The difference in ratio of perfect SSRs in different fungi species has been noted, and general relationship between the ratio and overall SSR loci and similarly between ratio of perfect SSR and genome size have not been noticed. In case of Fusarium graminearum, genome size was larger and SSR was least while perfect SSR repeats were the highest in ratio ( Li et al., 2009 ). 4 Conclusions In this study, we present a draft genome sequence of the isolated fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae RAH19, grown in plastic waste in India. This fungal strain has genome size 52.89 Mb, GC content of 55.21 % and repeat content of 0.94 %, 20,376 the predicted protein coding genes, SSRs with longest hexanucleotide repeat, and with highest RA of trinucleotide. This high-quality genome data represents a new valuable source for future studies on molecular diagnostics and plastic degradation by this fungus. As per literature search, our work of genome-wide SSR identification of L. theobromae is first time report. This microsatellite (SSRs) proposed work may be inroad of future research on the importance of SSRs in genome organization, SSR marker organization, etc. The following are the supplementary data related to this article.
