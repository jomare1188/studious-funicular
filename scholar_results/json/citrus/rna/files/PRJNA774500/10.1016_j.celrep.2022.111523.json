    "full_text": "All metazoan guts are subject to opposing pressures wherein the immune system must eliminate pathogens while tolerating the presence of symbiotic microbiota. The Imd pathway is an essential defense against invading pathogens in insect guts, but tolerance mechanisms are less understood. Here, we find PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB express mainly in the anterior and middle midgut in a similar pattern to symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae bacteria along the Bactrocera dorsalis gut. Knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB enhances the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes and reduces Enterobacteriaceae numbers while increasing abundance of opportunistic pathogens. Microbiota numbers recover to normal levels after the RNAi effect subsided. In contrast, high expression of PGRP-LC in the foregut allows increased antibacterial peptide production to efficiently filter the entry of pathogens, protecting the symbiotic bacteria. Our study describes a mechanism by which regional expression of PGRPs construct a protective zone for symbiotic microbiota while maintaining the ability to fight pathogens."

          "The gut epithelium interacts with complex microbial communities that range from beneficial microorganisms to pathogens ( Dillon and Dillon, 2004 ). Beneficial microorganisms influence host health and behavior in many ways, including provisioning of specific nutrients ( Thong-On et al., 2012 ); protection from predators, parasites, and pathogens ( Endt et al., 2010 ; Stecher and Hardt, 2011 ); and promotion of host growth and development ( Shin et al., 2011 ). Alteration of intestinal microbiota composition, density, and function (“dysbiosis”) has been associated with numerous host pathologies ( Clark et al., 2015 ; Nyholm and Graf, 2012 ; Round and Mazmanian, 2009 ). Thus, maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis is essential for health of the host.",
          "Gut microbiota may be affected by various environmental and host factors, such as food, age, pH range, and oxygen levels in the gut ( Clark et al., 2015 ; Engel and Moran, 2013 ). Moreover, innate immunity is a key regulator of microbial abundance ( Buchon et al., 2013b ). Recent studies have shown two major immune pathways regulate gut microbiota homeostasis in insects. First is the production of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) by dual oxidase (Duox) and Nox ( Iatsenko et al., 2018 ; Lee et al., 2013 ; Xiao et al., 2017 ; Yao et al., 2016 ). Second is the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), regulated mainly by the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Guo et al., 2013 ; Ryu et al., 2008 ). Duox-dependent ROS generation in the gut is dependent on the production of uracil by pathogenic but not commensal bacteria, allowing selective preservation of beneficial microbiota ( Lee et al., 2013 ).",
          "Studies in Drosophila have shown that the Imd pathway is activated upon the detection of diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan or peptidoglycan monomers, which are derived from nearly all gram-negative bacteria and some gram-positive bacteria, by the pattern recognition receptors PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE ( Bosco-Drayon et al., 2012 ; Buchon et al., 2013b ; Neyen et al., 2012 ). PGRP-LC is a transmembrane pattern recognition receptor that senses extracellular peptidoglycans, while PGRP-LE is an intracellular receptor thought to recognize cytoplasmic peptidoglycans. Both of these receptors recruit the Imd adaptor, converging to activate the transcription factor Relish ( Buchon et al., 2013b ). This pathway regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides that can combat pathogens and shape microbiota composition ( Liehl et al., 2006 ; Marra et al., 2021 ). Several mechanisms have been identified that keep the Imd pathway in check in the gut. Imd activity stimulates expression of amidase peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) (such as PGRP-LB, PGRP-SB1, PGRP-SB2, PGRP-SC1a, PGRP-SC1b, and PGRP-SC2), which scavenge peptidoglycan and reduce its immunogenicity, establishing a negative feedback loop that adjusts the magnitude of AMP production ( Bischoff et al., 2006 ; Mellroth and Steiner, 2006 ; Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006 ). Moreover, the transcription factor Caudal and the enzyme Transglutaminase dampen Imd pathway activation by repressing expression of nuclear factor kappa B-dependent antimicrobial peptides ( Ryu et al., 2008 ; Shibata et al., 2013 ). Loss of several genes including Caudal , amidase PGRPs, and Transglutaminase disrupt gut microbiota homeostasis in Drosophila ( Guo et al., 2013 ; Ryu et al., 2008 ; Shibata et al., 2013 ). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of the Imd pathway to accommodate the presence of beneficial microorganisms while mounting an effective immune response to combat pathogens is not fully established.",
          "The Oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a pest damaging more than 250 different species of fruits and vegetables worldwide. Its vast adaptability, high reproductive potential, and polyphagous nature make this insect one of the world’s most invasive agricultural pests ( Clarke et al., 2005 ; Li et al., 2011 ). In contrast to laboratory populations of Drosophila , in which the gut microbiota is transient and must be constantly replenished by ingestion to persist in most laboratory conditions ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Inês et al., 2018 ), B. dorsalis harbors a stable and complex bacterial community in which the dominant microbiota members belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae, and major genera include Enterobacter , Citrobacter, and Klebsiella ( Wang et al., 2011 , 2014 ). Previous studies have shown that these bacterial species were beneficial to their host insect B. dorsalis ( Cai et al., 2018 ; Cheng et al., 2017 ; Li et al., 2020 ; Raza et al., 2020 ; Ren et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Therefore, B. dorsalis is emerging as an alternative insect model to decipher host-microbe interactions.",
          "Using high-throughput sequencing and qPCR, we find that symbiotic bacteria are mainly located in the anterior midgut (AMG) of B. dorsalis , and their spatial distribution in different gut regions perfectly matches the expression profiles of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB, two PGRP genes that negatively regulate the Imd pathway of B. dorsalis . Both PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB in the midgut restrain the host’s immune response to provide a protective zone for symbiotic bacteria. Consistent with this, knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB decreased the abundance of symbiotic bacteria in the AMG due to higher Imd pathway immune activation. In contrast, silencing the Imd pathway receptor gene PGRP-LC, which is expressed in the foregut, increases colonization by the opportunistic pathogen P. rettgeri, which ultimately overtakes the AMG and disrupts the microbiota. Our results clearly show that regional expression of pattern recognition receptor and amidase PGRPs tightly regulate the Imd pathway to tolerate symbiotic bacteria while barring colonization by pathogenic bacteria."

              "To clarify host mechanisms that regulate the gut microbiota, we used qPCR to investigate the distribution of bacteria along the B. dorsalis gut, which can be divided into three domains: foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Among them, the midgut can be further sub-divided into the anterior midgut (AMG), the middle midgut (MMG), and the posterior midgut (PMG) ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). The density of Enterobacteriaceae and total bacteria was significantly higher in the AMG and MMG than in other gut regions ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Culture-dependent analysis of the gut microbiome corroborated these findings, indicating that colony-forming units (CFUs) of total culturable bacteria and culturable Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were both most abundant in the AMG ( Figures 1 D and 1E). More than 50% of CFUs in AMG and MMG were identified as Citrobacter and Enterobacter microbiota species ( Figure 1 F), with Citrobacter koseri , Enterobacter cloacae , and Enterobacter hormaechei being the dominant species ( Table S1 ). The foregut had the richest bacterial community (comprising Enterococcus , Lactococcus , Escherichia , and Arthrobacter species, among others), while the opportunistic pathogens of the Providencia and Morganella genera were dominant in the PMG and hindgut ( Figure 1 F).",
              "We next conducted high-throughput sequencing to more precisely define the community structure and the relative abundance of bacterial species residing in each gut region. The richness was highest in the foregut (90 unique OTUs per sample on average), then decreased to a stable level in following gut regions ( Figure 1 G). Based on Simpson diversity indexes, the AMG and MMG had the greatest diversity, and the hindgut had the lowest diversity ( Figure 1 G). Principal coordinate analyses (PcoA) revealed that the composition and structure of bacterial community varied with gut region, with PC1 and PC2 accounting for 76.71% and 15.24% of the observed variance, respectively ( Figure 1 H).",
              "In terms of relative abundance, the high-throughput sequencing revealed that Citrobacter , Enterobacter , Klebsiella , Serratia , and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae dominated the AMG and MMG regions ( Figure 1 I). In the foregut, Lactobacillus , Fructobacillus , Empedobacter, Comamonas, Dysgonomonas, Lactococcus, Vagococcus , and Sphingobacterium bacteria were the dominant types; these gradually decreased to undetectable levels farther down the gut ( Figure 1 I). Opportunistic pathogens such as Providencia and Morganella bacteria were mainly present in the PMG region and hindgut ( Figure 1 I). Collectively, these results demonstrate that microbiota member distribution is regionalized along the gut. Bacteria that are known to be beneficial to the host are most abundant in the AMG and MMG regions, while few are present in the foregut and hindgut."

              "To investigate potential impacts of host genes on the spatial distribution of symbiotic bacteria in the gut, we carried out transcriptomic sequencing of the five gut regions. Transcriptome assembly and annotation of immune-related genes identified a total of eight AMPs ( Attacin A , Attacin B , Attacin C , Diptericin , Phormicin , Sapecin , Cecropin , and Defensin ) and five genes encoding peptidoglycan-receptor proteins ( PGRP-LC , PGRP-LE , PGRP-LB , PGRP-SB , and PGRP-SC2 ) expressed in the gut ( Figures 2 A–2D and S1 B–S1D).",
              "We found that the membrane-bound PGRP-LC was highly expressed in the foregut and hindgut, while the intracellular receptor gene PGRP-LE was highly expressed in the AMG region ( Figures 2 A and 2C). This expression pattern of PGRP-LC in the gut of B. dorsalis is similar to that in Drosophila ( Neyen et al., 2012 ). Consistent with the distribution pattern of PGRP-LC , six AMP genes ( Attacin A , Attacin B , Attacin C , Diptericin , Phormicin , and Sapecin ) were also expressed in the foregut and hindgut but were minimally expressed (if at all) in other gut regions ( Figures 2 B and 2D). We further confirmed regional activation of the Imd pathway along the B. dorsalis gut by monitoring the expression of Diptericin , an important effector gene of the Imd pathway, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). As expected, Diptericin expression was enriched in the foregut and the hindgut ( Figure S1 E). We did note that two other AMP genes, Cecropin and Defensin , were highly expressed in the AMG ( Figures S1 B–S1D). Different from Attacins and Diptericin , which are mostly regulated by the Imd pathway and primarily exhibit antibacterial activity ( Hanson et al., 2019 ; Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007 ), Cecropin and Defensin are regulated by Imd, Toll, and other pathways, and have both antibacterial and some antifungal activities ( Carboni et al., 2022 ; Hanson et al., 2019 ; Hedengren-Olcott et al., 2004 ; Pan et al., 2012 ; Tanji et al., 2010 ).",
              "Importantly, Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression profiles of PGRP-LC and AMPs are negatively correlated with the relative abundance and density of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria (including Citrobacter , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Serratia , and Enterobacteriaceae_unclassified) ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Thus, the expression profile for PGRP-LC and the six immune effector genes that reflect Imd pathway activity inversely mirror the distribution of symbiotic bacteria in the midgut. This suggests that regional activity of the Imd pathway delineates zones suitable for the growth of beneficial bacteria."

              "We then investigated the mechanism generating the pattern of Imd pathway activity along the digestive tract. Imd signaling is tightly controlled by multiple negative regulators, notably amidase PGRPs that can scavenge peptidoglycans ( Bosco-Drayon et al., 2012 ; Bischoff et al., 2006 ; Mellroth and Steiner, 2006 ; Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006 ). Interestingly, our RNA sequencing study reveals that three amidase PGRP genes, PGRP-LB , PGRP - SB , and PGRP - SC2, are expressed along the digestive tract. Further analysis of transcriptome and qPCR data showed that PGRP-LB , PGRP-SB , and PGRP-SC2 were expressed in the midgut but not in the foregut or hindgut where Imd pathway activity is high ( Figures 2 A and 2C), revealing a pattern opposite to the expression of PGRP-LC and AMPs ( Figures 2 B and 2D). More specifically, PGRP-LB was highly expressed throughout all three midgut sub-regions, PGRP-SB was highly expressed in the AMG region, and PGRP-SC2 was highly expressed in the PMG region ( Figures 2 A and 2C). Spearman correlation analysis showed that expression profiles of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB are positively correlated with the relative abundance and density of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria in different gut regions ( Figures 2 E and 2G). These observations suggested that PGRP-LB and PGRP - SB but not PGRP-SC2 (due to its restricted expression in PMG) could play a role in limiting Imd pathway activity in the AMG creating a zone favorable to symbiotic bacteria."

              "The results above prompted us to investigate the effects of Imd pathway activation on the distribution of gut microbiota by inducing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) knockdown of the two pattern recognition receptor PGRPs that activate the Imd pathway, PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, and the two negative regulator PGRPs, PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB , and monitoring impacts on the density of symbiotic bacteria using qPCR. We first showed that there was no off-target effect among PGRP-LC , PGRP-LE , PGPR-LB , and PGPR-SB knockdown experiment when silencing these genes in B. dorsalis ( Figures S2 A–S2D). Decreased AMP gene expression upon PGRP-LC or PGRP-LE knockdown did not affect total or Enterobacteriaceae bacterial density in any of the five gut regions ( Figures S2 E and S2F; Figures S2 I–S2L). In addition, single knockdown of PGRP-LB or PGRP-SB had very mild effects on AMP gene expression, with a small increased the expression level of Dpt in ds- PGRP-LB or ds- PGRP-SB treated flies, a very slight increase of AttA expression in ds- PGRP-SB treated flies, while other AMPs were expressed at wild-type levels ( Figures S2 G and S2H). The minor impact on AMP gene expression might be the reason why knockdown of PGPRP-LB or PGPR-SB had no impact on the density of total or Enterobacteriaceae bacteria in each of the five gut regions ( Figures S2 M–S2P).",
              "The lack of impact of PGRP-LB or PGRP-SB knockdown could be due to redundancy between these two amidase PGRPs. To test this notion, we injected flies with a mix of ds- PGRP-LB and ds- PGRP-SB and monitored AMP gene expression. Interestingly, simultaneous knockdown of these genes significantly enhanced the level of Imd pathway activity in the gut at 5 days post injection (DPI). Particularly, the expression of AttA , AttC , and Dpt was strongly increased in the AMG region, where both PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB are enriched, while no change in AMP expression was observed in other gut regions ( Figures 3 A–3F ). Simultaneous knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB also led to significant reductions in the total bacterial density, including Enterobacteriacae, in the AMG region, while no changes were observed in other gut regions ( Figures 3 G and 3H). This observation strongly suggests that higher AMP gene expression in the absence of negative regulators affects the maintenance of symbiotic bacteria. In addition, we observed a significant increase of the density of opportunistic pathogens such as Providencia and Morganella in the AMG, PMG, and HG regions of PGRP-LB/SB double-knockdown flies ( Figure 3 I).",
              "We further monitored dynamic changes in AMP expression and bacterial community at 10 DPI when the RNAi effect on PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB was lost ( Figures S3 A and S3B). We found that the expression of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB and AMP-encoding genes at 10 DPI returned to the same levels as controls ( Figures S3 C–S3H). Dysbiosis induced by double ds- PGRP-LB/SB knockdown similarly subsided at this late time point ( Figures S3 I–S3K). Altogether, our results demonstrate that two negative regulators of the Imd pathway, the amidase PGRPs PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB, generate a suitable zone in the AMG for enrichment of symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae bacteria in B. dorsalis gut by dampening AMP expression."

Expression levels of PGRP-LB , PGRP - SB , AttA , AttB , AttC , and Dpt were significantly higher in conventional flies than in ABX-treated flies ( Figures 4 C–4H). Consistent with the above results, simultaneous knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB induced the overexpression of AMPs in the AMG of conventional flies but not in ABX-reared flies ( Figures 4 E–4H). This suggests that symbiotic bacteria stimulate the Imd pathway, leading to the expression of the genes encoding AMPs and negative regulators of the Imd pathway, but that both PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB restrain activity of Imd pathway in the AMG to generate an environment favorable to beneficial bacteria."

              "The results above show that PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB prevent overactivation of the Imd pathway in the AMG compartment where the microbiota reside. This raised the question of how the Imd pathway can still be activated to fight the entry of pathogenic bacteria. We noted that Imd pathway recognition receptor PGRP-LC and AMPs are expressed at a higher level in the foregut, suggesting that one of the main functions of the Imd pathway in the foregut could be to eliminate invading microbes. To explore this, we fed flies with the opportunistic pathogen Providencia rettgeri , and monitored the expression of PGRP-LC and AMP genes by qPCR. We found that oral infection with P. rettgeri significantly increased expression of PGRP-LC , AttA , AttB , AttC , and Dpt in the foregut compared with uninfected flies ( Figure 5 A ). In contrast, oral infection with P. rettgeri did not significantly induce the expression of AMPs in the AMG region, although AttC was modestly induced ( Figures S4 A–S4D). Monitoring P. rettgeri abundance in the gut from 0 to 72 h post oral infection (POI) revealed that P. rettgeri accumulated in the foregut, while only small numbers were detected in the AMG region at 0–12 h POI ( Figure S4 E). We found that P. rettgeri density decreased in both the foregut and AMG region over time, and finally became undetectable in the foregut at 48 h POI ( Figure S4 E). To further characterize the role of the Imd pathway in defense against P. rettgeri , we silenced PGRP-LC by injecting ds -PGRP-LC . This treatment effectively reduced the expression of PGRP-LC and AMPs in the foregut ( Figure 5 B). The reduced Imd immune response in the foregut of ds -PGRP-LC- treated flies resulted in significantly higher P. rettgeri loads at 4 h POI compared with control ds -egfp- treated flies ( Figure 5 C). Due to another immune pathway, the Duox-ROS system that also plays a vital role in the control of pathogens in the gut ( Lee et al., 2013 ; Yao et al., 2016 ), we silenced PGPR-LC and Duox separately or simultaneously ( Figures S4 F–S4H). Interestingly, P. rettgeri loads in the mix of ds -PGRP-LC- and ds -Duox- treated flies increased significantly when compared with control ds -egfp- treated flies at 4 h POI ( Figure S4 H), or flies singly treated with ds -PGRP-LC or ds -Duox ( Figure S4 H). The compensatory upregulation of Duox in the foregut upon PGRP-LC knockdown explains the much stronger phenotype with the combined knockdown of PGRP-LC and Duox ( Figure S4 G). These results indicate that the Imd pathway plays a critical role in controlling bacteria in the foregut, but its activity is partially covered by the activity of the Duox-ROS system."

We analyzed gut microbiota composition in the AMG of flies with reduced PGRP-LC subjected to P. rettgeri oral infection. Interestingly, suppressing the Imd immune response in the foregut by silencing PGRP-LC resulted in significantly higher P. rettgeri abundance not only in the foregut but also in the AMG region compared with controls ( Figure 5 D). Strikingly, silencing PGRP-LC in flies orally infected with P. rettgeri led to significant reductions in the abundance of the symbiotic bacteria C. koseri and E. cloacae in the AMG compared with ds- egfp controls ( Figure 5 E). We conclude that the Imd pathway plays a major role in the defense against invading pathogenic bacteria while protecting symbiotic bacteria in the AMG. As PGRP-LC gene expression is specifically enriched in the foregut, this suggests that PGRP-LC exerts a protective effect on symbiotic bacteria through its ability to regulate AMPs in the foregut and filter the entry of pathogenic bacteria."

          "The gastrointestinal tract harbors a great diversity of symbiotic bacteria that influence many aspects of the host ( Engel and Moran, 2013 ). The long-term evolutionary interaction of the host immune system with symbiotic bacteria determines their cooperative rather than antagonistic relationship ( Pang et al., 2016 ). How the host tolerates the presence of gut-colonizing autochthonous symbiotic bacteria while responding to and eliminating potential pathogens remains a major enigma in mucosal immunity. The metazoan gastrointestinal tract is a complex tissue composed of multiple compartments bearing different immune components, pH, and oxygen levels ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Buchon et al., 2013a ; Ceja-Navarro et al., 2014 ; Donaldson et al., 2016 ; Marianes and Spradling, 2013 ; Neyen et al., 2012 ; Zheng et al., 2017 ) that perform different functions ( Geng et al., 2018 ; Hudry et al., 2019 ). In this study, we mapped the localization of the bacterial community in different gut regions of B. dorsalis , and found that the distribution of symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae bacteria, such as Citrobacter and Enterobacter , etc. were concentrated in the anterior midgut. Gut microbiota compartmentalization also occurs in other insects, such as Odontotaenius disjunctus , Nicrophorus vespilloides , Anabrus simplex , Apis mellifera , and Drosophila melanogaster ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Ceja-Navarro et al., 2014 ; Li et al., 2016 ; Martinson et al., 2012 ; Smith et al., 2017 ; Vogel et al., 2017 ), and in mammals, including humans, macaques, mice, cows, and flying squirrels ( Donaldson et al., 2016 ). In Drosophila , the acidic copper cell region (CCR) in the middle midgut controls the distribution and the composition of the microbiota. The AMG-located commensal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum appears to colonize the PMG of flies after disruption of the CCR ( Li et al., 2016 ). L. plantarum overgrowth in the gut of flies mutant for the immune regulator PGRP-SD leads to precocious intestinal aging and a shortened lifespan ( Iatsenko et al., 2018 ). On the whole, maintaining the compartmentalization homeostasis of gut microbiota is critical for animal health.",
          "Previous studies have highlighted the role of amidase PGRPs as negative regulators of the Imd pathway in the gut ( Charroux et al., 2018 ; Paredes et al., 2011 ). Despite the established importance of the Imd pathway in the gut, little is known about mechanisms by which Imd signaling tolerates symbiotic microbiota while combatting pathogens. Due to the transience of gut microbiota in laboratory populations of Drosophila ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Storelli et al., 2018 ), it is a poor model in which to study stable colonization of the host, and correspondence between microbiota and host gene expression. In contrast, the gut of B. dorsalis harbors a stable and abundant microbiota ( Cai et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2011 ; Yao et al., 2016 ), which has allowed characterization of the microbiota tolerance mechanism. Our study reveals that Imd pathway activation in the digestive tract of this insect is highly compartmentalized. Strong Imd pathway activity associated with high PGRP-LC and AMP gene expression is observed in foregut and hindgut but not the midgut. In contrast, the negative regulators PGRP-LB , PGRP-SB , and PGRP-SC2 were highly expressed in the midgut. Moreover, our data show that high expression of negative regulators keep the Imd pathway in check in the midgut. Our study shows that the low Imd activity in the AMG establishes a niche that favors cultivation of beneficial microbiota. Simultaneous knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB induced overexpression of AMPs in gut, leading to a significant reduction in symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae bacteria, and to a significant increase of the opportunistic pathogens Providencia and Morganella . Our data are consistent with a previous study showing that high expression of antimicrobial peptides in Caudal RNAi flies favors growth of the pathobiont Gluconobacter in the gut of Drosophila , which is more resistant to antibacterial peptides ( Ryu et al., 2008 ). We further found that the disrupted gut microbiota returned to normal as the RNAi effects dissipated and PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB returned to basal expression levels. This indicates that the gut microbiota of B. dorsalis is resilient to perturbation. Similarly, the composition of the bacterial flora of PGRP-deficient mice is significantly altered, and PGRPs can prevent aberrant inflammatory responses by promoting normal bacterial flora ( Saha et al., 2010 ). Collectively these studies point to a conserved role of PGRPs as modulators of host-microbe interactions in the gut. Our study in B. dorsalis shows that two amidase PGRPs, PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB, reduce intestinal immune reactivity in the AMG, while another PGRP, PGRP-SC2, is expressed in the posterior midgut. PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB are active only on DAP-type peptidoglycan found in gram-negative bacteria and Bacillus ( Mellroth and Steiner, 2006 ; Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006 , 2011 ), while PGRP-SC2 has a broader activity range targeting both DAP and Lysine type peptidoglycan ( Mellroth et al., 2003 ). Thus, the specific expression profile of various PGRPs with different enzymatic activities could shape the microbiota along the gut. In addition, we found that gut microbiota homeostasis was not affected by silencing PGRP-LB or PGRP-SB individually. This suggests a certain level of redundancy and that both genes are needed to scavenge peptidoglycans and prevent expression of diverse AMPs that suppress beneficial gut microbes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that a combined action of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB in the AMG provides a suitable low-AMP environment for symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae to persist in this gut compartment.",
          "That expression of amidase PGRPs dampens the immune system to favor beneficial bacteria in the gut creates a conundrum, as this could reduce the ability of the insect to fight opportunistic pathogens that enter through the oral route. Our study reveals that compartmentalization of the immune system along the gut provides a solution by mounting a potent immune response in the foregut, without affecting symbiotic bacteria. Indeed, our study shows that PGRP-LC and AMP genes are expressed at higher level in the foregut and their expression is markedly increased upon oral infection with the opportunistic pathogen P. rettgeri . Silencing PGRP-LC led to the invasion of P. rettgeri not only in the foregut but also in the AMG region. As PGRP-LC is mostly expressed in the foregut, we assume this is primarily due to reduction of PGRP-LC in the foregut. Interestingly, disruption of PGRP-LC not only affects P. rettgeri, but also disrupts the microbiota, as illustrated by a reduction in the abundance of the symbiotic C. koseri and E. cloacae . Thus, our study reveals a prominent role of the foregut in host defense against invading pathogens in filtering incoming bacteria, while the midgut immune system is specialized to maintain beneficial bacteria. It is worth noting that the regulation of the immune response in the foregut does not only involve the Imd pathway but also the production of ROS by NADPH, lysozyme production, and likely other mechanisms, that require further investigation ( Ryu et al., 2008 ; Lee et al., 2013 ; Yao et al., 2016 ; Marra et al., 2021 ).",
          "These results led us to propose a model in which the Imd pathway balances mucosal immunity and regionalized gut-microbe homeostasis. Symbiotic bacteria are mainly located in anterior midgut of B. dorsalis ; their distribution perfectly matches the expression pattern of amidase PGRPs, indicating that PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB establish a protective zone by dampening Imd pathway activation. In contrast, the expression of PGRP-LC and the absence of PGRP-LB/SB in the foregut maintains a higher level of basal and inducible AMP expression to protect from potential invading pathogens, effectively avoiding disruption of symbiotic bacteria. Given the universality of symbiotic bacteria compartmentalization in the gut ( Donaldson et al., 2016 ), and dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota that arises from abnormal immune-microbe interactions ( Chen et al., 2019 ; Iatsenko et al., 2018 ), our results may be of significance to other metazoans, including vertebrates."

              "One limitation of our study is that it relies on the use of systemic injection of dsRNA for gene silencing. This method leads to a systemic knockdown of gene expression affecting all the tissues. However, our model provides the most parsimonious explanation by suggesting that the effects we observed are due to their impact on gene expressed in the gut, where these genes are enriched. Another limitation of our study is that the mechanisms we discovered that allow to construct a protective zone for symbiotic microbiota while maintaining the ability to fight pathogens could be restricted to B. dorsalis. Future research is needed to determine if similar mechanisms also exist in other insects, because other factors, such as food digestion, different pH and oxygen gradient along the intestine, and peristalsis are likely also influencing the regional distribution and composition of microbiome along the gut besides the regionalized Imd pathway expression."

                  "Different gut regions of female (age: 7 days after emergence) were carefully dissected in ice-cold PBS and fixed in fixative (including 4% formaldehyde and 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH7.0–7.5) for 2 h at room temperature. After fixation, the tissue was dehydrated by gradient alcohol, dipped into paraffin and embedded. Then paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were sectioned to 4 μm thick FFPE tissue sections by a slicer, and FISH staining was performed as previously described ( Moter and Gober, 2000 ). Briefly, FFPE tissue sections were dried under 62°C condition for 2 h, then the tissue sections were sequentially placed into xylene (twice in 30 min), anhydrous ethanol (twice in 10 min), then 85% alcohol (5 min), 75% alcohol (5 min), rinsed with RNAase-free water, lastly boiled in repair solution (15 min). Then added proteinase K (20 μg/mL) for digestion (30 min), and washed three times with PBS. Added pre-hybridization solution and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Then discarded the pre-hybridization solution and replaced with hybridization solution containing Dpt probe (5′-TCTATGCCTTGCTTAGGACTACCACCTCCCTGTAA-3′) overnight at 37°C. The hybridization solution was washed away with 2 × saline sodium citrate (SSC) (10 min), 1 × SSC (twice in 10 min) at 37°C condition, and 0.5 × SSC (10 min) at room temperature. Counterstain by 4′-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was performed in the dark condition for 8 min. After washing, antifluorescence quenched sealer was added. DAPI non-specifically stained nuclear nucleic acids and was blue under the ultraviolet laser, while the representative positive signal carboxy-fluorescein (FAM) (488) was green. The images were captured by fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse ci, Japan) with a 100 times magnification."

    "full_text": "Introduction The gut epithelium interacts with complex microbial communities that range from beneficial microorganisms to pathogens ( Dillon and Dillon, 2004 ). Beneficial microorganisms influence host health and behavior in many ways, including provisioning of specific nutrients ( Thong-On et al., 2012 ); protection from predators, parasites, and pathogens ( Endt et al., 2010 ; Stecher and Hardt, 2011 ); and promotion of host growth and development ( Shin et al., 2011 ). Alteration of intestinal microbiota composition, density, and function (“dysbiosis”) has been associated with numerous host pathologies ( Clark et al., 2015 ; Nyholm and Graf, 2012 ; Round and Mazmanian, 2009 ). Thus, maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis is essential for health of the host. Gut microbiota may be affected by various environmental and host factors, such as food, age, pH range, and oxygen levels in the gut ( Clark et al., 2015 ; Engel and Moran, 2013 ). Moreover, innate immunity is a key regulator of microbial abundance ( Buchon et al., 2013b ). Recent studies have shown two major immune pathways regulate gut microbiota homeostasis in insects. First is the production of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) by dual oxidase (Duox) and Nox ( Iatsenko et al., 2018 ; Lee et al., 2013 ; Xiao et al., 2017 ; Yao et al., 2016 ). Second is the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), regulated mainly by the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Guo et al., 2013 ; Ryu et al., 2008 ). Duox-dependent ROS generation in the gut is dependent on the production of uracil by pathogenic but not commensal bacteria, allowing selective preservation of beneficial microbiota ( Lee et al., 2013 ). Studies in Drosophila have shown that the Imd pathway is activated upon the detection of diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan or peptidoglycan monomers, which are derived from nearly all gram-negative bacteria and some gram-positive bacteria, by the pattern recognition receptors PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE ( Bosco-Drayon et al., 2012 ; Buchon et al., 2013b ; Neyen et al., 2012 ). PGRP-LC is a transmembrane pattern recognition receptor that senses extracellular peptidoglycans, while PGRP-LE is an intracellular receptor thought to recognize cytoplasmic peptidoglycans. Both of these receptors recruit the Imd adaptor, converging to activate the transcription factor Relish ( Buchon et al., 2013b ). This pathway regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides that can combat pathogens and shape microbiota composition ( Liehl et al., 2006 ; Marra et al., 2021 ). Several mechanisms have been identified that keep the Imd pathway in check in the gut. Imd activity stimulates expression of amidase peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) (such as PGRP-LB, PGRP-SB1, PGRP-SB2, PGRP-SC1a, PGRP-SC1b, and PGRP-SC2), which scavenge peptidoglycan and reduce its immunogenicity, establishing a negative feedback loop that adjusts the magnitude of AMP production ( Bischoff et al., 2006 ; Mellroth and Steiner, 2006 ; Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006 ). Moreover, the transcription factor Caudal and the enzyme Transglutaminase dampen Imd pathway activation by repressing expression of nuclear factor kappa B-dependent antimicrobial peptides ( Ryu et al., 2008 ; Shibata et al., 2013 ). Loss of several genes including Caudal , amidase PGRPs, and Transglutaminase disrupt gut microbiota homeostasis in Drosophila ( Guo et al., 2013 ; Ryu et al., 2008 ; Shibata et al., 2013 ). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of the Imd pathway to accommodate the presence of beneficial microorganisms while mounting an effective immune response to combat pathogens is not fully established. The Oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a pest damaging more than 250 different species of fruits and vegetables worldwide. Its vast adaptability, high reproductive potential, and polyphagous nature make this insect one of the world’s most invasive agricultural pests ( Clarke et al., 2005 ; Li et al., 2011 ). In contrast to laboratory populations of Drosophila , in which the gut microbiota is transient and must be constantly replenished by ingestion to persist in most laboratory conditions ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Inês et al., 2018 ), B. dorsalis harbors a stable and complex bacterial community in which the dominant microbiota members belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae, and major genera include Enterobacter , Citrobacter, and Klebsiella ( Wang et al., 2011 , 2014 ). Previous studies have shown that these bacterial species were beneficial to their host insect B. dorsalis ( Cai et al., 2018 ; Cheng et al., 2017 ; Li et al., 2020 ; Raza et al., 2020 ; Ren et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Therefore, B. dorsalis is emerging as an alternative insect model to decipher host-microbe interactions. Using high-throughput sequencing and qPCR, we find that symbiotic bacteria are mainly located in the anterior midgut (AMG) of B. dorsalis , and their spatial distribution in different gut regions perfectly matches the expression profiles of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB, two PGRP genes that negatively regulate the Imd pathway of B. dorsalis . Both PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB in the midgut restrain the host’s immune response to provide a protective zone for symbiotic bacteria. Consistent with this, knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB decreased the abundance of symbiotic bacteria in the AMG due to higher Imd pathway immune activation. In contrast, silencing the Imd pathway receptor gene PGRP-LC, which is expressed in the foregut, increases colonization by the opportunistic pathogen P. rettgeri, which ultimately overtakes the AMG and disrupts the microbiota. Our results clearly show that regional expression of pattern recognition receptor and amidase PGRPs tightly regulate the Imd pathway to tolerate symbiotic bacteria while barring colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Results Symbiotic bacteria are mainly located in the anterior midgut of B. dorsalis To clarify host mechanisms that regulate the gut microbiota, we used qPCR to investigate the distribution of bacteria along the B. dorsalis gut, which can be divided into three domains: foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Among them, the midgut can be further sub-divided into the anterior midgut (AMG), the middle midgut (MMG), and the posterior midgut (PMG) ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). The density of Enterobacteriaceae and total bacteria was significantly higher in the AMG and MMG than in other gut regions ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Culture-dependent analysis of the gut microbiome corroborated these findings, indicating that colony-forming units (CFUs) of total culturable bacteria and culturable Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were both most abundant in the AMG ( Figures 1 D and 1E). More than 50% of CFUs in AMG and MMG were identified as Citrobacter and Enterobacter microbiota species ( Figure 1 F), with Citrobacter koseri , Enterobacter cloacae , and Enterobacter hormaechei being the dominant species ( Table S1 ). The foregut had the richest bacterial community (comprising Enterococcus , Lactococcus , Escherichia , and Arthrobacter species, among others), while the opportunistic pathogens of the Providencia and Morganella genera were dominant in the PMG and hindgut ( Figure 1 F). We next conducted high-throughput sequencing to more precisely define the community structure and the relative abundance of bacterial species residing in each gut region. The richness was highest in the foregut (90 unique OTUs per sample on average), then decreased to a stable level in following gut regions ( Figure 1 G). Based on Simpson diversity indexes, the AMG and MMG had the greatest diversity, and the hindgut had the lowest diversity ( Figure 1 G). Principal coordinate analyses (PcoA) revealed that the composition and structure of bacterial community varied with gut region, with PC1 and PC2 accounting for 76.71% and 15.24% of the observed variance, respectively ( Figure 1 H). In terms of relative abundance, the high-throughput sequencing revealed that Citrobacter , Enterobacter , Klebsiella , Serratia , and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae dominated the AMG and MMG regions ( Figure 1 I). In the foregut, Lactobacillus , Fructobacillus , Empedobacter, Comamonas, Dysgonomonas, Lactococcus, Vagococcus , and Sphingobacterium bacteria were the dominant types; these gradually decreased to undetectable levels farther down the gut ( Figure 1 I). Opportunistic pathogens such as Providencia and Morganella bacteria were mainly present in the PMG region and hindgut ( Figure 1 I). Collectively, these results demonstrate that microbiota member distribution is regionalized along the gut. Bacteria that are known to be beneficial to the host are most abundant in the AMG and MMG regions, while few are present in the foregut and hindgut. Regional activation of the Imd pathway inversely mirrors the distribution of symbiotic bacteria along the gut To investigate potential impacts of host genes on the spatial distribution of symbiotic bacteria in the gut, we carried out transcriptomic sequencing of the five gut regions. Transcriptome assembly and annotation of immune-related genes identified a total of eight AMPs ( Attacin A , Attacin B , Attacin C , Diptericin , Phormicin , Sapecin , Cecropin , and Defensin ) and five genes encoding peptidoglycan-receptor proteins ( PGRP-LC , PGRP-LE , PGRP-LB , PGRP-SB , and PGRP-SC2 ) expressed in the gut ( Figures 2 A–2D and S1 B–S1D). We found that the membrane-bound PGRP-LC was highly expressed in the foregut and hindgut, while the intracellular receptor gene PGRP-LE was highly expressed in the AMG region ( Figures 2 A and 2C). This expression pattern of PGRP-LC in the gut of B. dorsalis is similar to that in Drosophila ( Neyen et al., 2012 ). Consistent with the distribution pattern of PGRP-LC , six AMP genes ( Attacin A , Attacin B , Attacin C , Diptericin , Phormicin , and Sapecin ) were also expressed in the foregut and hindgut but were minimally expressed (if at all) in other gut regions ( Figures 2 B and 2D). We further confirmed regional activation of the Imd pathway along the B. dorsalis gut by monitoring the expression of Diptericin , an important effector gene of the Imd pathway, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). As expected, Diptericin expression was enriched in the foregut and the hindgut ( Figure S1 E). We did note that two other AMP genes, Cecropin and Defensin , were highly expressed in the AMG ( Figures S1 B–S1D). Different from Attacins and Diptericin , which are mostly regulated by the Imd pathway and primarily exhibit antibacterial activity ( Hanson et al., 2019 ; Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007 ), Cecropin and Defensin are regulated by Imd, Toll, and other pathways, and have both antibacterial and some antifungal activities ( Carboni et al., 2022 ; Hanson et al., 2019 ; Hedengren-Olcott et al., 2004 ; Pan et al., 2012 ; Tanji et al., 2010 ). Importantly, Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression profiles of PGRP-LC and AMPs are negatively correlated with the relative abundance and density of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria (including Citrobacter , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Serratia , and Enterobacteriaceae_unclassified) ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Thus, the expression profile for PGRP-LC and the six immune effector genes that reflect Imd pathway activity inversely mirror the distribution of symbiotic bacteria in the midgut. This suggests that regional activity of the Imd pathway delineates zones suitable for the growth of beneficial bacteria. Negative regulators of the Imd pathway match the distribution pattern of symbiotic bacteria along the gut We then investigated the mechanism generating the pattern of Imd pathway activity along the digestive tract. Imd signaling is tightly controlled by multiple negative regulators, notably amidase PGRPs that can scavenge peptidoglycans ( Bosco-Drayon et al., 2012 ; Bischoff et al., 2006 ; Mellroth and Steiner, 2006 ; Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006 ). Interestingly, our RNA sequencing study reveals that three amidase PGRP genes, PGRP-LB , PGRP - SB , and PGRP - SC2, are expressed along the digestive tract. Further analysis of transcriptome and qPCR data showed that PGRP-LB , PGRP-SB , and PGRP-SC2 were expressed in the midgut but not in the foregut or hindgut where Imd pathway activity is high ( Figures 2 A and 2C), revealing a pattern opposite to the expression of PGRP-LC and AMPs ( Figures 2 B and 2D). More specifically, PGRP-LB was highly expressed throughout all three midgut sub-regions, PGRP-SB was highly expressed in the AMG region, and PGRP-SC2 was highly expressed in the PMG region ( Figures 2 A and 2C). Spearman correlation analysis showed that expression profiles of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB are positively correlated with the relative abundance and density of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria in different gut regions ( Figures 2 E and 2G). These observations suggested that PGRP-LB and PGRP - SB but not PGRP-SC2 (due to its restricted expression in PMG) could play a role in limiting Imd pathway activity in the AMG creating a zone favorable to symbiotic bacteria. Both PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB restrain immune effector expression in the midgut to establish protective zones for symbiotic bacteria The results above prompted us to investigate the effects of Imd pathway activation on the distribution of gut microbiota by inducing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) knockdown of the two pattern recognition receptor PGRPs that activate the Imd pathway, PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, and the two negative regulator PGRPs, PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB , and monitoring impacts on the density of symbiotic bacteria using qPCR. We first showed that there was no off-target effect among PGRP-LC , PGRP-LE , PGPR-LB , and PGPR-SB knockdown experiment when silencing these genes in B. dorsalis ( Figures S2 A–S2D). Decreased AMP gene expression upon PGRP-LC or PGRP-LE knockdown did not affect total or Enterobacteriaceae bacterial density in any of the five gut regions ( Figures S2 E and S2F; Figures S2 I–S2L). In addition, single knockdown of PGRP-LB or PGRP-SB had very mild effects on AMP gene expression, with a small increased the expression level of Dpt in ds- PGRP-LB or ds- PGRP-SB treated flies, a very slight increase of AttA expression in ds- PGRP-SB treated flies, while other AMPs were expressed at wild-type levels ( Figures S2 G and S2H). The minor impact on AMP gene expression might be the reason why knockdown of PGPRP-LB or PGPR-SB had no impact on the density of total or Enterobacteriaceae bacteria in each of the five gut regions ( Figures S2 M–S2P). The lack of impact of PGRP-LB or PGRP-SB knockdown could be due to redundancy between these two amidase PGRPs. To test this notion, we injected flies with a mix of ds- PGRP-LB and ds- PGRP-SB and monitored AMP gene expression. Interestingly, simultaneous knockdown of these genes significantly enhanced the level of Imd pathway activity in the gut at 5 days post injection (DPI). Particularly, the expression of AttA , AttC , and Dpt was strongly increased in the AMG region, where both PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB are enriched, while no change in AMP expression was observed in other gut regions ( Figures 3 A–3F ). Simultaneous knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB also led to significant reductions in the total bacterial density, including Enterobacteriacae, in the AMG region, while no changes were observed in other gut regions ( Figures 3 G and 3H). This observation strongly suggests that higher AMP gene expression in the absence of negative regulators affects the maintenance of symbiotic bacteria. In addition, we observed a significant increase of the density of opportunistic pathogens such as Providencia and Morganella in the AMG, PMG, and HG regions of PGRP-LB/SB double-knockdown flies ( Figure 3 I). We further monitored dynamic changes in AMP expression and bacterial community at 10 DPI when the RNAi effect on PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB was lost ( Figures S3 A and S3B). We found that the expression of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB and AMP-encoding genes at 10 DPI returned to the same levels as controls ( Figures S3 C–S3H). Dysbiosis induced by double ds- PGRP-LB/SB knockdown similarly subsided at this late time point ( Figures S3 I–S3K). Altogether, our results demonstrate that two negative regulators of the Imd pathway, the amidase PGRPs PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB, generate a suitable zone in the AMG for enrichment of symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae bacteria in B. dorsalis gut by dampening AMP expression. Symbiotic bacteria activate the expression of PGRP-LB and PGRP - SB, which dampens AMP expression in the AMG To better understand the relationship between symbiotic bacteria and regulation of Imd pathway activity in the AMG, we analyzed the expression of PGRP-LB , PGRP-SB , and AMP genes in the gut of conventionally reared and antibiotic treated (ABX) flies ( Figures 4 A and 4B ). Expression levels of PGRP-LB , PGRP - SB , AttA , AttB , AttC , and Dpt were significantly higher in conventional flies than in ABX-treated flies ( Figures 4 C–4H). Consistent with the above results, simultaneous knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB induced the overexpression of AMPs in the AMG of conventional flies but not in ABX-reared flies ( Figures 4 E–4H). This suggests that symbiotic bacteria stimulate the Imd pathway, leading to the expression of the genes encoding AMPs and negative regulators of the Imd pathway, but that both PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB restrain activity of Imd pathway in the AMG to generate an environment favorable to beneficial bacteria. Imd pathway activation in the foregut contributes to host defense against bacterial invasion The results above show that PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB prevent overactivation of the Imd pathway in the AMG compartment where the microbiota reside. This raised the question of how the Imd pathway can still be activated to fight the entry of pathogenic bacteria. We noted that Imd pathway recognition receptor PGRP-LC and AMPs are expressed at a higher level in the foregut, suggesting that one of the main functions of the Imd pathway in the foregut could be to eliminate invading microbes. To explore this, we fed flies with the opportunistic pathogen Providencia rettgeri , and monitored the expression of PGRP-LC and AMP genes by qPCR. We found that oral infection with P. rettgeri significantly increased expression of PGRP-LC , AttA , AttB , AttC , and Dpt in the foregut compared with uninfected flies ( Figure 5 A ). In contrast, oral infection with P. rettgeri did not significantly induce the expression of AMPs in the AMG region, although AttC was modestly induced ( Figures S4 A–S4D). Monitoring P. rettgeri abundance in the gut from 0 to 72 h post oral infection (POI) revealed that P. rettgeri accumulated in the foregut, while only small numbers were detected in the AMG region at 0–12 h POI ( Figure S4 E). We found that P. rettgeri density decreased in both the foregut and AMG region over time, and finally became undetectable in the foregut at 48 h POI ( Figure S4 E). To further characterize the role of the Imd pathway in defense against P. rettgeri , we silenced PGRP-LC by injecting ds -PGRP-LC . This treatment effectively reduced the expression of PGRP-LC and AMPs in the foregut ( Figure 5 B). The reduced Imd immune response in the foregut of ds -PGRP-LC- treated flies resulted in significantly higher P. rettgeri loads at 4 h POI compared with control ds -egfp- treated flies ( Figure 5 C). Due to another immune pathway, the Duox-ROS system that also plays a vital role in the control of pathogens in the gut ( Lee et al., 2013 ; Yao et al., 2016 ), we silenced PGPR-LC and Duox separately or simultaneously ( Figures S4 F–S4H). Interestingly, P. rettgeri loads in the mix of ds -PGRP-LC- and ds -Duox- treated flies increased significantly when compared with control ds -egfp- treated flies at 4 h POI ( Figure S4 H), or flies singly treated with ds -PGRP-LC or ds -Duox ( Figure S4 H). The compensatory upregulation of Duox in the foregut upon PGRP-LC knockdown explains the much stronger phenotype with the combined knockdown of PGRP-LC and Duox ( Figure S4 G). These results indicate that the Imd pathway plays a critical role in controlling bacteria in the foregut, but its activity is partially covered by the activity of the Duox-ROS system. Activation of the Imd pathway in the foregut protects against dysbiosis of symbiotic bacteria induced by P. rettgeri We next hypothesized that Imd pathway activation in the foregut could be critical to protect the gut microbiota in the AMG by limiting colonization by invading pathogens. We analyzed gut microbiota composition in the AMG of flies with reduced PGRP-LC subjected to P. rettgeri oral infection. Interestingly, suppressing the Imd immune response in the foregut by silencing PGRP-LC resulted in significantly higher P. rettgeri abundance not only in the foregut but also in the AMG region compared with controls ( Figure 5 D). Strikingly, silencing PGRP-LC in flies orally infected with P. rettgeri led to significant reductions in the abundance of the symbiotic bacteria C. koseri and E. cloacae in the AMG compared with ds- egfp controls ( Figure 5 E). We conclude that the Imd pathway plays a major role in the defense against invading pathogenic bacteria while protecting symbiotic bacteria in the AMG. As PGRP-LC gene expression is specifically enriched in the foregut, this suggests that PGRP-LC exerts a protective effect on symbiotic bacteria through its ability to regulate AMPs in the foregut and filter the entry of pathogenic bacteria. Discussion The gastrointestinal tract harbors a great diversity of symbiotic bacteria that influence many aspects of the host ( Engel and Moran, 2013 ). The long-term evolutionary interaction of the host immune system with symbiotic bacteria determines their cooperative rather than antagonistic relationship ( Pang et al., 2016 ). How the host tolerates the presence of gut-colonizing autochthonous symbiotic bacteria while responding to and eliminating potential pathogens remains a major enigma in mucosal immunity. The metazoan gastrointestinal tract is a complex tissue composed of multiple compartments bearing different immune components, pH, and oxygen levels ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Buchon et al., 2013a ; Ceja-Navarro et al., 2014 ; Donaldson et al., 2016 ; Marianes and Spradling, 2013 ; Neyen et al., 2012 ; Zheng et al., 2017 ) that perform different functions ( Geng et al., 2018 ; Hudry et al., 2019 ). In this study, we mapped the localization of the bacterial community in different gut regions of B. dorsalis , and found that the distribution of symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae bacteria, such as Citrobacter and Enterobacter , etc. were concentrated in the anterior midgut. Gut microbiota compartmentalization also occurs in other insects, such as Odontotaenius disjunctus , Nicrophorus vespilloides , Anabrus simplex , Apis mellifera , and Drosophila melanogaster ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Ceja-Navarro et al., 2014 ; Li et al., 2016 ; Martinson et al., 2012 ; Smith et al., 2017 ; Vogel et al., 2017 ), and in mammals, including humans, macaques, mice, cows, and flying squirrels ( Donaldson et al., 2016 ). In Drosophila , the acidic copper cell region (CCR) in the middle midgut controls the distribution and the composition of the microbiota. The AMG-located commensal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum appears to colonize the PMG of flies after disruption of the CCR ( Li et al., 2016 ). L. plantarum overgrowth in the gut of flies mutant for the immune regulator PGRP-SD leads to precocious intestinal aging and a shortened lifespan ( Iatsenko et al., 2018 ). On the whole, maintaining the compartmentalization homeostasis of gut microbiota is critical for animal health. Previous studies have highlighted the role of amidase PGRPs as negative regulators of the Imd pathway in the gut ( Charroux et al., 2018 ; Paredes et al., 2011 ). Despite the established importance of the Imd pathway in the gut, little is known about mechanisms by which Imd signaling tolerates symbiotic microbiota while combatting pathogens. Due to the transience of gut microbiota in laboratory populations of Drosophila ( Broderick et al., 2014 ; Storelli et al., 2018 ), it is a poor model in which to study stable colonization of the host, and correspondence between microbiota and host gene expression. In contrast, the gut of B. dorsalis harbors a stable and abundant microbiota ( Cai et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2011 ; Yao et al., 2016 ), which has allowed characterization of the microbiota tolerance mechanism. Our study reveals that Imd pathway activation in the digestive tract of this insect is highly compartmentalized. Strong Imd pathway activity associated with high PGRP-LC and AMP gene expression is observed in foregut and hindgut but not the midgut. In contrast, the negative regulators PGRP-LB , PGRP-SB , and PGRP-SC2 were highly expressed in the midgut. Moreover, our data show that high expression of negative regulators keep the Imd pathway in check in the midgut. Our study shows that the low Imd activity in the AMG establishes a niche that favors cultivation of beneficial microbiota. Simultaneous knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB induced overexpression of AMPs in gut, leading to a significant reduction in symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae bacteria, and to a significant increase of the opportunistic pathogens Providencia and Morganella . Our data are consistent with a previous study showing that high expression of antimicrobial peptides in Caudal RNAi flies favors growth of the pathobiont Gluconobacter in the gut of Drosophila , which is more resistant to antibacterial peptides ( Ryu et al., 2008 ). We further found that the disrupted gut microbiota returned to normal as the RNAi effects dissipated and PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB returned to basal expression levels. This indicates that the gut microbiota of B. dorsalis is resilient to perturbation. Similarly, the composition of the bacterial flora of PGRP-deficient mice is significantly altered, and PGRPs can prevent aberrant inflammatory responses by promoting normal bacterial flora ( Saha et al., 2010 ). Collectively these studies point to a conserved role of PGRPs as modulators of host-microbe interactions in the gut. Our study in B. dorsalis shows that two amidase PGRPs, PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB, reduce intestinal immune reactivity in the AMG, while another PGRP, PGRP-SC2, is expressed in the posterior midgut. PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB are active only on DAP-type peptidoglycan found in gram-negative bacteria and Bacillus ( Mellroth and Steiner, 2006 ; Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2006 , 2011 ), while PGRP-SC2 has a broader activity range targeting both DAP and Lysine type peptidoglycan ( Mellroth et al., 2003 ). Thus, the specific expression profile of various PGRPs with different enzymatic activities could shape the microbiota along the gut. In addition, we found that gut microbiota homeostasis was not affected by silencing PGRP-LB or PGRP-SB individually. This suggests a certain level of redundancy and that both genes are needed to scavenge peptidoglycans and prevent expression of diverse AMPs that suppress beneficial gut microbes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that a combined action of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB in the AMG provides a suitable low-AMP environment for symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae to persist in this gut compartment. That expression of amidase PGRPs dampens the immune system to favor beneficial bacteria in the gut creates a conundrum, as this could reduce the ability of the insect to fight opportunistic pathogens that enter through the oral route. Our study reveals that compartmentalization of the immune system along the gut provides a solution by mounting a potent immune response in the foregut, without affecting symbiotic bacteria. Indeed, our study shows that PGRP-LC and AMP genes are expressed at higher level in the foregut and their expression is markedly increased upon oral infection with the opportunistic pathogen P. rettgeri . Silencing PGRP-LC led to the invasion of P. rettgeri not only in the foregut but also in the AMG region. As PGRP-LC is mostly expressed in the foregut, we assume this is primarily due to reduction of PGRP-LC in the foregut. Interestingly, disruption of PGRP-LC not only affects P. rettgeri, but also disrupts the microbiota, as illustrated by a reduction in the abundance of the symbiotic C. koseri and E. cloacae . Thus, our study reveals a prominent role of the foregut in host defense against invading pathogens in filtering incoming bacteria, while the midgut immune system is specialized to maintain beneficial bacteria. It is worth noting that the regulation of the immune response in the foregut does not only involve the Imd pathway but also the production of ROS by NADPH, lysozyme production, and likely other mechanisms, that require further investigation ( Ryu et al., 2008 ; Lee et al., 2013 ; Yao et al., 2016 ; Marra et al., 2021 ). These results led us to propose a model in which the Imd pathway balances mucosal immunity and regionalized gut-microbe homeostasis. Symbiotic bacteria are mainly located in anterior midgut of B. dorsalis ; their distribution perfectly matches the expression pattern of amidase PGRPs, indicating that PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB establish a protective zone by dampening Imd pathway activation. In contrast, the expression of PGRP-LC and the absence of PGRP-LB/SB in the foregut maintains a higher level of basal and inducible AMP expression to protect from potential invading pathogens, effectively avoiding disruption of symbiotic bacteria. Given the universality of symbiotic bacteria compartmentalization in the gut ( Donaldson et al., 2016 ), and dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota that arises from abnormal immune-microbe interactions ( Chen et al., 2019 ; Iatsenko et al., 2018 ), our results may be of significance to other metazoans, including vertebrates. Limitations of the study One limitation of our study is that it relies on the use of systemic injection of dsRNA for gene silencing. This method leads to a systemic knockdown of gene expression affecting all the tissues. However, our model provides the most parsimonious explanation by suggesting that the effects we observed are due to their impact on gene expressed in the gut, where these genes are enriched. Another limitation of our study is that the mechanisms we discovered that allow to construct a protective zone for symbiotic microbiota while maintaining the ability to fight pathogens could be restricted to B. dorsalis. Future research is needed to determine if similar mechanisms also exist in other insects, because other factors, such as food digestion, different pH and oxygen gradient along the intestine, and peristalsis are likely also influencing the regional distribution and composition of microbiome along the gut besides the regionalized Imd pathway expression.

Materials availability This study did not generate new, unique reagents. Experimental model and subject details Insect rearing The oriental fruit flies were reared at the Institute of Horticultural and Urban Entomology, Huazhong Agricultural University (Wuhan, China), with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at 27 ± 1°C and 70–80% relative humidity. After eclosion, adult flies were moved to 30 × 30 × 30 cm cages and maintained on an artificial diet consisting of 3:1 sucrose/yeast extract. Female flies were used for all experiments. Method details Antibiotic treatment For antibiotic treatment, newly emerged flies were fed on sterile water supplemented with penicillin (3 mg/mL), streptomycin (5 mg/mL), and gentamicin (3 mg/mL), on a cotton pad that was changed every 24 h ( Raza et al., 2020 ). Gut dissection Before dissection, flies were surface-sterilized by immersion in 75% ethanol for 3 min and rinsed three times in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) as previously described ( Guo et al., 2022 ). The whole gut was carefully dissected and stretched out in ice-cold PBS with flame-sterilized tools, then cut into five regions for RNA and DNA extraction: (1) foregut-FG, including the pharynx, esophagus, intact crop and cardia; (2) anterior midgut-AMG; (3) middle midgut-MMG; (4) posterior midgut-PMG and (5) hindgut-HG, including the ileum, colon and rectum ( Figure 1 A). Determinate pH in the gut lumen of B. dorsalis Two pH indicators-phenol red and bromophenol blue were used to assess the pH values in different gut regions of B. dorsalis adult (age: 7 days after emergence). Bromophenol blue is yellow when pH values ≤3.0, and blue when pH values ≥4.6; phenol red is yellow at pH values ≤6.8, and fuchsia at pH values ≥8.2, with a gradual color transition for intermediate values as previously described ( Bruno et al., 2018 ). B. dorsalis adults were first dehydrated for 24 h without food and then fed an artificial diet (2.5% yeast extract, 7.5% sugar, 2.5% honey and 87% H 2 O) supplemented with 0.2% (w/w) bromophenol blue or phenol red for 24 h. Finally, the guts of these flies were carefully dissected and stretched out in ice-cold PBS, and coloration of the gut content was evaluated with a stereomicroscope. RNA extraction and sequencing Total RNA was isolated from the five regions of 80 adult guts (age: 7 days after emergence) per biological replicate using RNAiso Plus reagent (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, three biological replicates were conducted. RNA degradation was monitored by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was sent to the Novogene Experimental Department (Tianjin, China) for library preparation and sequencing. The raw sequencing reads were deposited in Short Read Archive at NCBI under the accession number PRJNA774500. Raw reads were first processed through in-house perl scripts to remove reads containing adapter, reads containing poly-N and low quality reads. At the same time, Q20, Q30, GC-content and sequence duplication level of the clean data were calculated. Transcriptome assembly was performed with Trinity ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ) and sequence redundancy was reduced with the sequence clustering tool Corset ( Davidson and Oshlack, 2014 ). Differential gene expression analysis Functional gene annotation utilized seven databases: NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (Nr); NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences (Nt); Protein family (Pfam); Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (KOG/COG); a manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database (Swiss-Prot); KEGG Ortholog database (KOG) and Gene Ontology (GO). Gene expression levels were estimated by RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) ( Li and Dewey, 2011 ). Bacterial DNA extraction and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing DNA was extracted from 100 gut regions of flies (age: 7 days after emergence) per biological replicate using the E.Z.N.A.® Soil DNA kit (Omega, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, six biological replicates were conducted. The 16S rRNA gene spanning variable regions V3+V4 was amplified using the broad-range forward primer 341F: CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG and the reverse primer 806R: GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT using the Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA). The PCR amplification program consisted of (1) preincubation at 95°C for 5 min; (2) 35 cycles of 45 s at 56°C, then 1 min at 72°C and 45 s at 94°C; (3) 10 min at 72°C. The PCR products were sent to Novogene Experimental Department for sequencing. The raw sequencing reads were deposited in Short Read Archive at NCBI under the accession number PRJNA777066. After obtaining the raw reads, the single-end reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcode and truncated by cutting off the barcode and primer sequence. Quality filtering on the raw reads was performed under specific filtering conditions to obtain high-quality clean reads according to the Cutadapt (b1.9.1, http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ ) quality controlled process ( Martin, 2011 ). The reads were compared with the reference database (Silva database, https://www.arb-silva.de/ ) using UCHIME algorithm (UCHIME Algorithm, http://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/uchime_algo.html ) to detect chimera sequences, and then the chimera sequences were removed, the Clean Reads finally obtained. Sequences were clustered into OTUs of ≥97% similarity using Uparse software (Uparse v7.0.1001, http://drive5.com/upare ). Representative sequence for each OTU was screened for further annotation, and taxonomy assignment was carried out with mothur algorithm using the silva database. OTUs abundance information were normalized using a standard of sequence number corresponding to the sample with the least sequences. Alpha diversity (including observed-species, chao1, shannon, simpson and ace) and beta diversity on weighted unifrac were calculated with qime and displayed with R software. Gut bacterial cultures, quantification and identification Dissected samples of the five gut regions from approximately 30 females (age: 7 days after emergence) were homogenized in 1 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline for 60 s using a burnisher at 70hz/s. An aliquot from these samples was serially diluted and plated onto two media: Luria-Bertani (LB) nutrient agar plates and a chromogenic medium CHROMagar™ Orientation (CHR, buy from Shanghai central bio-engineering CO., LTD). After incubation at 30°C for 24–48 h, individual and morphologically distinct colonies counted for colony forming morphologically units (CFUs). LB counts were used for total bacterial CFUs, while CHR can distinguish Enterobacteriaceae strains based on both color and morphology ( Singh and Bhunia, 2016 ); morphological characteristics of different bacterial species in the B. dorsalis gut are shown in Figure S5 A. To investigate the composition of symbiotic bacteria in different gut regions of B. dorsalis , 617 bacterial strains were isolated from CHR medium, then inoculated into corresponding liquid media and shaken at 220 rpm and 30°C overnight to produce biomass for DNA extraction. The bacterial DNA was extracted by using the HiPure Bacterial DNA Kit (Magen, Guangzhou, China). Amplify the 16S rRNA gene by RT-PCR was performed to identify each bacterial isolate, with primers: 27f (5′-GTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492r (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) ( Ceja-Navarro et al., 2015 ), under the PCR conditions: 94°C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 10 s, 55°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 30 s; 72°C for 5 min. Finally, the PCR products were purified by using E.Z.N.A.® Cycle-Pure kit (Omega, Norcross, GA, USA) and then subjected to bidirectional sanger sequencing. These sequences were BLASTed against the NCBI 16S rRNA sequences database to identify the cultivable bacterial strains. Microbial oral infection The opportunistic pathogen Providencia rettgeri used for oral infection was grown as a shaking culture in LB medium at 37°C, 220 r.p.m overnight. The culture of ∼300 mL was pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 3,200 g) and adjusted to the appropriate concentration with optical density (O.D.) at 600 nm. Adult flies (age: 3–4 days) were dehydrated for 24 h without food and then fed an artificial diet supplemented with 5% sucrose containing the concentrated microbe solution ( P. rettgeri OD600= 50). Flies supplemented with 5% sucrose only served as a control. For bacterial count in FG, flies treated with dsRNA were maintained on this diet for 4 h, and subsequently starved. For analyses of Imd pathway immune gene expression and dynamic changes of P. rettgeri and symbiotic bacteria in ds -egfp or ds -PGRP-LC treated flies, they were maintained on this diet for 9 h, and subsequently transferred to fresh food. The gut region samples for different treatments were collected at different time points post oral infection. Quantification of bacterial species or group by qPCR Gut bacterial DNA extraction from female flies was performed as described above. For bacteria quantification, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed and normalized to the host β-actin gene. In this study, wzb and wzc genes of bacteria were used to design specific qPCR primers for Citrobacter koseri , Enterobacter cloacae , Providencia rettgeri and Providencia - Morganella group bacterial density detection; the specificity of qPCR primers was confirmed by RT-PCR ( Figures S5 B–S5E). RT-PCR was carried out in a volume of 25 μL. Each PCR mixture consisted of 12.5 μL of A8 MasterMix (Aidlab Biotechnologies Co., Ltd), 200 nM of each primer and 100 ng DNA. The amplification program consisted of (1) Initial denaturation 95°C for 3 min; (2) 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 60°C for 15 s and extension at 72°C for 15 s; (3) final extension 72°C for 5 min. All the primers for detection of bacterial groups and species are shown in Table S2 . qPCR was carried out in 20 μL reaction volume included 10 μL of SYBR Green Mix (Bio-Rad), 200 nM of each primer and 5 ng of DNA. Real-time PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX Connect system with the following protocol: (1) preincubation at 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10 min; (2) 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and annealing at 60°C for 1 min; and (3) one cycle at 95°C for 15 s, 53°C for 15 s and 95°C for 15 s. Gene expression analysis by qPCR For gene expression analysis, five independent cohorts of ∼30 flies each were collected for RNA extraction. The first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) of each pool was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit (Takara) with gDNA eraser to remove residual DNA contamination. qPCR was carried out in 20 μL reaction volume included 10 μL of SYBR Green Mix (Bio-Rad), 400 nM of each primer and 2 μL of cDNA (diluted 1:10). Real-time PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX Connect system with the following protocol: initial denaturation of 95°C for 30 s, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s. Melting curve analysis was performed at the end of each amplification run to confirm the presence of a single peak, with the following protocol: 55°C for 60 s, followed by 81 cycles starting at 55°C for 10 s with a 0.5°C increase each cycle. Relative quantification was calculated according to the 2 -ΔΔCt method ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ), at least three independent biological replicates and three technical replicates were performed for every sample. The levels of detected mRNA determined by cycling threshold analysis were normalized using 60S ribosomal protein L32 ( RpL32 ) as the control, primers used in qPCR analysis were listed in Table S3 . dsRNA synthesis and RNAi experiments The RNA interference (RNAi) technique, which generates loss-of-function phenotypes by depletion of a chosen transcript by short/small interfering RNA (siRNA, come from double-stranded RNA cleaved by the enzyme Dicer into ∼21 nucleotides), has emerged as a powerful reverse genetics tool for studying gene function, regulation, and interaction at the cellular and organismal levels in many eukaryotic systems, including a number of insect species ( Zhu and Palli, 2020 ). Thanks to the robustness and specificity of RNAi technique, many genes’ functions have been revealed in B. dorsalis ( Chen et al., 2008 ; Yao et al., 2016 ; Huang et al., 2019 ; Raza et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). In this study, specific dsRNA primers with the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′) on the 5′ end were used to clone the target sequence fragments by nested PCR, sequences of the primers were listed in Table S3 . 1 μg PCR product was used as the specific-template for synthesizing of dsRNA in vitro by using the T7 Ribomax Express RNAi System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The concentration of dsRNA was quantitated at 260 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The quality and integrity of dsRNA were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Needles for injecting dsRNA were produced by a puller (PC-10, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) at heat level 60.8. Microinjection of dsRNA was performed by Eppendorf micromanipulation system (Microinjector for cell biology, FemtoJet 5247, Hamburg, Germany) with Pi of 300 hpa and Ti of 0.3 s as previously described ( Yao et al., 2016 ). RNAi experiments were performed by injecting 1 μL of a 2μg μL −1 solution of dsRNA into the ventral abdomen of each fly (2–3 days old). For RNAi of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB , or PGRP-LC and Duox simultaneously, 1 μL of combined ds- PGRP-LB + ds- PGRP-SB , or ds- PGRP-LC + ds- Duox dsRNA was injected at the final concentration of 2μg μL −1 ; control flies were injected with ds- egfp . Gut tissue sections and RNA FISH Different gut regions of female (age: 7 days after emergence) were carefully dissected in ice-cold PBS and fixed in fixative (including 4% formaldehyde and 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH7.0–7.5) for 2 h at room temperature. After fixation, the tissue was dehydrated by gradient alcohol, dipped into paraffin and embedded. Then paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were sectioned to 4 μm thick FFPE tissue sections by a slicer, and FISH staining was performed as previously described ( Moter and Gober, 2000 ). Briefly, FFPE tissue sections were dried under 62°C condition for 2 h, then the tissue sections were sequentially placed into xylene (twice in 30 min), anhydrous ethanol (twice in 10 min), then 85% alcohol (5 min), 75% alcohol (5 min), rinsed with RNAase-free water, lastly boiled in repair solution (15 min). Then added proteinase K (20 μg/mL) for digestion (30 min), and washed three times with PBS. Added pre-hybridization solution and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Then discarded the pre-hybridization solution and replaced with hybridization solution containing Dpt probe (5′-TCTATGCCTTGCTTAGGACTACCACCTCCCTGTAA-3′) overnight at 37°C. The hybridization solution was washed away with 2 × saline sodium citrate (SSC) (10 min), 1 × SSC (twice in 10 min) at 37°C condition, and 0.5 × SSC (10 min) at room temperature. Counterstain by 4′-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was performed in the dark condition for 8 min. After washing, antifluorescence quenched sealer was added. DAPI non-specifically stained nuclear nucleic acids and was blue under the ultraviolet laser, while the representative positive signal carboxy-fluorescein (FAM) (488) was green. The images were captured by fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse ci, Japan) with a 100 times magnification. Quantification and statistical analysis Two-tailed Student’s t -test were used for two-group comparisons in the GraphPad Prism software. Multiple comparisons were carried out with one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s post hoc test using SPSS 20.0 software. The differences were considered statistically significant when a value of p < 0.05. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. All statistical details can be found in the according figure legends.
