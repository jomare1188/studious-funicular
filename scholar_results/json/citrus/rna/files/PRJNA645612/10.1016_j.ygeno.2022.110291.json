    "full_text": "Citrus fruits exhibit vivid color and are favored extensively. However, the biochemical and molecular mechanism of Citrus Reticulata Blanco fruits coloring, especially the effect of transplantation on fruits coloring, is unclear. Herein, RNA-Seq and carotenoids profiling were applied to investigate the effect of transplantation on Orah mandarin fruits coloring. Transplantation induces fruit color shallowing, Ca 2+ and ACC level declining and IAA level increasing. Transplantation induced variation in fruit skin and pulp carotenoids, mainly β-citraurin as one of the important pigments of citrus peel. 2253 up-regulated genes, 1103 down-regulated genes in skin and 815 up-regulated genes, 534 down-regulated genes in pulp of transplanted tree fruits were identified by RNA-Seq. The DEGs involved hormone signal, carotenoids biosynthesis and TFs such as MYB and bHLH family TFs. The carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene ( Ciclev10028113m.g ) is positively correlated with β-citraurin and regulated directly and/or indirectly by MYB1R1, PIF4, ACC and IAA. Integrative analyses revealed potential molecular insights into Orah mandarin peel color variation during transplantation."

          "Varieties of the citrus can produce fruits with vivid color, including purple, red, pink and yellow, which are largely determined by the carotenoid and anthocyanins [ 1–4 ]. Anthocyanins color specific organs (seeds, fruit, leaves, flowers) of many plants with magenta, red, scarlet, blue and purple [ 2 ]. Carotenoid, a group of natural tetraterpenoid pigments, mainly endows the plant organs with yellow, red and orange [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. Except as a pigment in plants, carotenoids and its derivatives also play important roles in plant development and responsing to environmental cues. Besides, as the antioxidants and sources of provitamin A, carotenoids are beneficial for human nutrition and health [ 1 , 3 , 4 ].",
          "Over the past few decades, the carotenoids biosynthetic pathway has been well elucidated by screening a series of related enzymatic steps and the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid accumulation has been established in a variety of fruit species, especially in tomato as the model fruit [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. The first step of de novo synthesis pathway of carotenoid through the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is starting from the formation of dimethylallyldiphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which is catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) [ 5 , 6 ]. DMAPP is an isomer of IPP with isomeration by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI) [ 5 , 6 ]. IPP and DMAPP could be used to synthesize carotenoids or chlorophylls, which is controlled by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPS) that interacts with phytoene synthase (PSY) and GGPS recruiting protein to channel GGPP [ 7 , 8 ]. Then, phytoene, the first carotenoid, is generated under condensation of two GGPP [ 4 ]. Under the direction of ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), ζ-carotene isomerase ( Z -ISO) and phytoene desaturase (PDS), the phytoene is converted to a red carotenoid lycopene [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. There are two fates of lycopene: 1. In turn, lycopene is converted to α-carotene, zeinoxanthin and lutein under the direction of lycopene ε-cyclase (LycE)/ lycopene β-cyclase (LycB), CYP97A and β-carotene hydrolase 1/2 (BCH1/2), CYP97C, respectively. 2. In turn, lycopene is converted to β-carotene, zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, violaxanthin and neoxathin under the direction of lycopene β-cyclase (LycB), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), neoxanthin synthase (NXS), respectively [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. The carotenes and xanthophylls may be further modified leading to the formation of various species-specific carotenoids [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 ]. For example, under the direction of by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), carotenoids could be converted to apocarotenoids such as citrus-specific β-citraurin and β-citraurinene [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 ]. β-citraurin and β-citraurinene endow citrus peel with red [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 ].",
          "The carotenoids biosynthetic pathway is strictly response to developmental and environmental signals [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 ]. Although little is known about the transcriptional regulation of carotenoid metabolism, several transcription factors have been shown to positively or negatively regulate the expression of the structural genes of carotenoids biosynthesis in several plant species, such as MYB family transcription factors which play a vital role in controlling carotenoids biosynthesis and determining pigmentation patterns [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 10 ]. Two Carica papaya transcriptional repressors (CpMYB1 and CpMYB2) could bind to the promoters of carotenoid biosynthesis genes and negatively regulate the expression of CpPDS2 , CpPDS4 and CpCHY-b [ 11 ]. Heterologously overexpressing Actinidia deliciosa R2R3-MYB transcription factor TFMYB7 enhanced the expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes, resulting in increased carotenoid pigmentations in leaves of transgenic tobacco [ 12 ]. Tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) R2R3-MYB transcription factor SlMYB72 has also been reported to regulate carotenoid biosynthesis and down-regulation of SlMYB72 promoted β-carotene production and decreased lycopene content in tomato [ 13 ]. Loss-of-function mutations of Mimulus lewisii RCP1 resulted in down-regulating the expression of most carotenoid biosynthetic genes and decreased content of carotenoid in flowers [ 14 ]. In Medicago truncatula , WHITE PETAL1 (MTWP1), one of the R2R3-MYB transcription factors, regulates the expression of carotenoid biosynthesis by forming a protein triplex, called MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex comprised of MYC-like bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) and WD40-repeat proteins [ 15 ]. The MBW complex positively regulates floral carotenoid pigmentation [ 15 ]. Two C. papaya bHLH transcriptional activators (CpbHLH1 and CpbHLH2) could bind to the cis-elements in the promoters of lycopene β-cyclase genes ( CpCYC-B and CpLCY-B ) and positively regulated their expressions [ 16 ]. Some PIFs such as PIF1 and PIF4, belonging to bHLH transcription factor, also participate in controlling carotenoid biosynthesis [ 17 , 18 ].",
          "Besides the transcription factors, the fruits color and carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is also controlled by developmental and environmental signals [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 19–22 ]. Plant hormones ethylene and jasmonate (MeJA) play positive roles in the carotenoid biosynthesis [ 19–21 ]. JA has been reported to enhance the carotenoid accumulation in maize sprouts [ 20 ]. Opposite to these hormones, gibberellins (GA) and auxin can retard carotenoid accumulation in fruits [ 19 , 22 ]. The mineral nutrition and many environmental factors such as temperatures, light intensity and light quality also control carotenoid biosynthesis in fruits [ 1 , 3 , 4 ].",
          "Mandarin ( C. reticulata Blanco), a hybrid of Temple orange and Dancy orange, is one of the four main cultivated citrus species. Because of appealing color, easy peeling, good flavor, rich in vitamin C and good taste, the fresh fruits of mandarin are favored extensively [ 23 ]. Unlike purple A. buxifolia (Chinese box orange, Atalantia) and yellow lemon, the color of mandarin fruit is mostly orange red [ 1 ]. Although the metabonomics analysis have been used for disclosing the potential metabolites participating in the color of mandarin fruits [ 24 ], the detailed molecular mechanisms of fruits coloring is not clear, especially for the correlation of fruits color with mineral nutrients and transplant.",
          "Transplantation may hinder the mineral elements absorption, thereby influences plant growth and development. In this study, the effect of transplantation on Orah mandarin fruits development and coloring was investigated, and the integrative analyses of transcriptome data and carotenoids profiling reveals potential molecular mechanism of Orah mandarin fruits development and coloring affected by transplantation."

At the commercially mature stage of the fruits, the samples of fruit pulp (namely TOP) and skin (namely TOS) from trees planted on the Chengxiang Town were collected and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for analysis. For the treatment, the 3-year-old mandarin was transplanted, and the mandarin reached high yield in the third year after transplanting. The fruit pulp (namely TOPY) and skin(namely TOSY)from trees planted on the Chengxiang Town in the third year after transplanting were also collected for subsequent analysis. All the mandarin trees were grown at the same management conditions. The trees and fruits used for phenotypic analysis were the 6-year-old and 7-year-old mandarin at the commercially mature stage. Three biological repetitions were performed for transcriptome and metabolic analysis, and six biological repetitions were completed for mineral element content analysis of skins and quality analysis of fruits. Each biological repetition contained the mixed skins or pulps powder derived from 15 fruits (three trees, five fruits from each tree)."

Transplantation has a great influence on carotenoids metabolism which affect the coloring of mandarin skin and pulp. Transplantation resulted in slight decline of β-carotene, zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin in fruit pulps of mandarin. The content of γ-carotene and α-cryptoxanthin slightly increased, while the content of lutein, β-carotene, zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin decreased in fruit skins of mandarin after transplantation. Moreover, the level of β-citraurin as one of important pigments of citrus fruit skin was significantly decreased by transplantation. A large number of DEGs involved in metabolic processes of hormone signal, carotenoids biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid metabolism, MYB and bHLH family TFs were identified in pulp of transplanted tree fruits compare to the control by RNA-Seq. The correlation analysis of transcriptome and carotenoids reveals the potential correlations between the carotenoids and DEGs, including carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene ( Ciclev10030384m.g ) which catalyzes the cleavage of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin yielding a red β-citraurin, in both TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY, which provides important clues for the molecular mechanism of the fruits color change after transplantation.",

          "The role of hormone on fruits development and carotenoids metabolism has been well studied [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 19–22 ]. Auxin is negatively correlated with carotenoids metabolism [ 19 ]. Endogenous application of auxin has been found to retard lycopene accumulation, while auxin antagonist (PCIB) accelerated the accumulation of lycopene in tomato fruit [ 19 ]. Our study show that a good deal of DEG is related to plant hormone signal transduction, regulation of hormone levels, hormone metabolic process and hormone biosynthetic process in both TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY. Moreover, 22 DEGs are related to auxin biosynthetic process in TOSR vs TOSY. The content of indoleacetic acid (IAA) increased in fruit skins of mandarin after transplantation. The above results suggest that auxin may have a great effect on the change of fruit skin coloring during transplantation. Ethylene is positively correlated with carotenoids metabolism [ 19 , 21 ]. Application of an ethylene precursor (ACC) accelerated the accumulation of lycopene in tomato fruit [ 19 ]. Some DEGs related to response ethylene are rich in TOPR vs TOPY and the content of ACC increased in fruit skins of mandarin after transplantation, which indicate that ethylene play positive roles in mandarin fruits coloring. It has been reported that there exist complex interactions between calcium and auxin during plant development [ 30–32 ]. Calcium is correlated with auxin synthesis, auxin homeostasis and auxin transporter polarity [ 31 , 32 ]. Furthermore, the role of ethylene in plant development is also related to calcium [ 33 , 34 ]. Therefore, we speculate that the change of calcium homeostasis in mandarin fruits after transplantation may affect the biosynthesis of auxin and ethylene, and then regulates mandarin fruits development and carotenoids metabolism.",
          "Transcription factor (TFs) play important roles in fruits development and coloring. Several MYB and bHLH family TFs have been shown to play vital roles in controlling carotenoids biosynthesis and determining pigmentation patterns [ 10–18 ]. In this study, the transcriptome analysis identified that transcriptional level of 32 MYB family TFs in skin and 15 MYB family TFs in pulp changed after transplantation, indicated that these MYB family TFs might have great effect on mandarin fruits development and color generation. Meanwhile, transplantation affected the expression of 23 and 11bHLH family TFs in skin and pulp, respectively. These bHLH family TFs may also participate in regulating fruits color generation by controlling carotenoids biosynthetic pathway. The expression of 19 MYB TFs and 11bHLH TFs in TOSR was lower than that in TOSY, indicated that these MYB TFs might positively regulate the carotenoids biosynthesis and their expressions were affected by transplantation. Oppositely, the transcriptional level of 13 MYB TFs and 12 bHLH TFs in skin increased after transplantation, manifested that these MYB TFs might be negatively correlated with skin color generation. Moreover, the correlation analysis show that Ciclev10005629m.g (MYB13), Ciclev10015986m.g (MYB62), Ciclev10015648m.g (MYB34), Ciclev10009050m.g (MYB41), Ciclev10007937m.g (bHLH041), Ciclev10027504m.g (bHLH25) and Ciclev10019118m.g (bHLH TF) are positively correlated with β-citraurin, while Ciclev10002239m.g (MYB77), Ciclev10024111m.g (MYB TF), Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1), Ciclev10025967m.g (bHLH61), Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4), Ciclev10020053m.g (PIF8) and Ciclev10019669m.g (bHLH 91) are negatively correlated with β-citraurin in skin of skin of mandarin. Interestingly, some negative bHLH TFs (MYB1R1, PIF4 and PIF8) correlated with carotenoids synthesis have also been reported. Our RNA-Seq analysis and qRT-PCR analysis also showed that the expression of Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1), Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) and Ciclev10020053m.g (PIF8) in skin increased by transplantation. Moreover, Y1H assay shows that Ciclev10032167m.g and Ciclev10031028m.g could bind to Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ) promoter. Therefore, Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) and Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) regulate directly the expression of Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ), thereby controlling the β-citraurin biosynthesis in fruit skin of mandarin and their expressions were affected by transplantation. Other MYB and bHLH TFs correlated with β-citraurin may indirectly regulate the β-citraurin biosynthesis in fruit skin of mandarin.",
          "It has been reported that auxin and ethylene positively or negatively regulate MYB TFs in different development process [ 10 , 35 ]. Transplantation induces the increasing of indoleacetic acid (IAA) level and decreasing of ACC level in fruit skins of mandarin. Moreover, the expression of Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) and Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) are promoted by exogenous IAA and inhibited by ACC, while IAA and ACC suppressed and accelerated the expression of Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ). The above results imply the role of Transplantation-Calcium-IAA/ACC-MYB1R1/PIF4-CCD signaling cascade in β-citraurin biosynthesis ( Fig. 6 ).This conjecture needs further confirmation. In conclusion, this study provides a global view of the metabolic variations associated with mandarin fruits development and coloring after transplantation ( Fig. 6 ). A comprehensive characterization of DEGs related to carotenoids metabolism, hormone signal and transcriptional regulation and the correlation analysis between DEGs and carotenoids caused by transplantation in mandarin skins and pulps has generated new data relating to mandarin development and coloring. Thus, the knowledge acquired in this study provides new rational targets for future work on mandarin fruits color improvement."

          "The present study explored the effect of transplantation on mandarin fruits development using the integrative analyses of transcriptome and carotenoids profiling. The transplantation resulted in leaf and fruit color shallowing, smaller size and lower weight of fruit, significantly decreased fruit total sugar, ACC and calcium ion content but increased vitamin C (VC), IAA and citric acid content. Transplantation also gave rise to the alteration of carotenoids in mandarin fruit skin and pulp, which contained β-citraurin as one of the important pigments of fruit skin of mandarin.

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Varieties of the citrus can produce fruits with vivid color, including purple, red, pink and yellow, which are largely determined by the carotenoid and anthocyanins [ 1–4 ]. Anthocyanins color specific organs (seeds, fruit, leaves, flowers) of many plants with magenta, red, scarlet, blue and purple [ 2 ]. Carotenoid, a group of natural tetraterpenoid pigments, mainly endows the plant organs with yellow, red and orange [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. Except as a pigment in plants, carotenoids and its derivatives also play important roles in plant development and responsing to environmental cues. Besides, as the antioxidants and sources of provitamin A, carotenoids are beneficial for human nutrition and health [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. Over the past few decades, the carotenoids biosynthetic pathway has been well elucidated by screening a series of related enzymatic steps and the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid accumulation has been established in a variety of fruit species, especially in tomato as the model fruit [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. The first step of de novo synthesis pathway of carotenoid through the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is starting from the formation of dimethylallyldiphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which is catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) [ 5 , 6 ]. DMAPP is an isomer of IPP with isomeration by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI) [ 5 , 6 ]. IPP and DMAPP could be used to synthesize carotenoids or chlorophylls, which is controlled by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPS) that interacts with phytoene synthase (PSY) and GGPS recruiting protein to channel GGPP [ 7 , 8 ]. Then, phytoene, the first carotenoid, is generated under condensation of two GGPP [ 4 ]. Under the direction of ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), ζ-carotene isomerase ( Z -ISO) and phytoene desaturase (PDS), the phytoene is converted to a red carotenoid lycopene [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. There are two fates of lycopene: 1. In turn, lycopene is converted to α-carotene, zeinoxanthin and lutein under the direction of lycopene ε-cyclase (LycE)/ lycopene β-cyclase (LycB), CYP97A and β-carotene hydrolase 1/2 (BCH1/2), CYP97C, respectively. 2. In turn, lycopene is converted to β-carotene, zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, violaxanthin and neoxathin under the direction of lycopene β-cyclase (LycB), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), neoxanthin synthase (NXS), respectively [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. The carotenes and xanthophylls may be further modified leading to the formation of various species-specific carotenoids [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 ]. For example, under the direction of by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), carotenoids could be converted to apocarotenoids such as citrus-specific β-citraurin and β-citraurinene [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 ]. β-citraurin and β-citraurinene endow citrus peel with red [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 ]. The carotenoids biosynthetic pathway is strictly response to developmental and environmental signals [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 ]. Although little is known about the transcriptional regulation of carotenoid metabolism, several transcription factors have been shown to positively or negatively regulate the expression of the structural genes of carotenoids biosynthesis in several plant species, such as MYB family transcription factors which play a vital role in controlling carotenoids biosynthesis and determining pigmentation patterns [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 10 ]. Two Carica papaya transcriptional repressors (CpMYB1 and CpMYB2) could bind to the promoters of carotenoid biosynthesis genes and negatively regulate the expression of CpPDS2 , CpPDS4 and CpCHY-b [ 11 ]. Heterologously overexpressing Actinidia deliciosa R2R3-MYB transcription factor TFMYB7 enhanced the expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes, resulting in increased carotenoid pigmentations in leaves of transgenic tobacco [ 12 ]. Tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) R2R3-MYB transcription factor SlMYB72 has also been reported to regulate carotenoid biosynthesis and down-regulation of SlMYB72 promoted β-carotene production and decreased lycopene content in tomato [ 13 ]. Loss-of-function mutations of Mimulus lewisii RCP1 resulted in down-regulating the expression of most carotenoid biosynthetic genes and decreased content of carotenoid in flowers [ 14 ]. In Medicago truncatula , WHITE PETAL1 (MTWP1), one of the R2R3-MYB transcription factors, regulates the expression of carotenoid biosynthesis by forming a protein triplex, called MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex comprised of MYC-like bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) and WD40-repeat proteins [ 15 ]. The MBW complex positively regulates floral carotenoid pigmentation [ 15 ]. Two C. papaya bHLH transcriptional activators (CpbHLH1 and CpbHLH2) could bind to the cis-elements in the promoters of lycopene β-cyclase genes ( CpCYC-B and CpLCY-B ) and positively regulated their expressions [ 16 ]. Some PIFs such as PIF1 and PIF4, belonging to bHLH transcription factor, also participate in controlling carotenoid biosynthesis [ 17 , 18 ]. Besides the transcription factors, the fruits color and carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is also controlled by developmental and environmental signals [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 19–22 ]. Plant hormones ethylene and jasmonate (MeJA) play positive roles in the carotenoid biosynthesis [ 19–21 ]. JA has been reported to enhance the carotenoid accumulation in maize sprouts [ 20 ]. Opposite to these hormones, gibberellins (GA) and auxin can retard carotenoid accumulation in fruits [ 19 , 22 ]. The mineral nutrition and many environmental factors such as temperatures, light intensity and light quality also control carotenoid biosynthesis in fruits [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. Mandarin ( C. reticulata Blanco), a hybrid of Temple orange and Dancy orange, is one of the four main cultivated citrus species. Because of appealing color, easy peeling, good flavor, rich in vitamin C and good taste, the fresh fruits of mandarin are favored extensively [ 23 ]. Unlike purple A. buxifolia (Chinese box orange, Atalantia) and yellow lemon, the color of mandarin fruit is mostly orange red [ 1 ]. Although the metabonomics analysis have been used for disclosing the potential metabolites participating in the color of mandarin fruits [ 24 ], the detailed molecular mechanisms of fruits coloring is not clear, especially for the correlation of fruits color with mineral nutrients and transplant. Transplantation may hinder the mineral elements absorption, thereby influences plant growth and development. In this study, the effect of transplantation on Orah mandarin fruits development and coloring was investigated, and the integrative analyses of transcriptome data and carotenoids profiling reveals potential molecular mechanism of Orah mandarin fruits development and coloring affected by transplantation. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials and growth conditions The six years old Orah mandarin ( Citrus reticulata Blanco) was grown in the orchard of Chengxiang Town, Ningwu Town and Luobo Town (Wuming District, Nanning City, Guangxi Province, China), respectively. At the commercially mature stage of the fruits, the samples of fruit pulp (namely TOP) and skin (namely TOS) from trees planted on the Chengxiang Town were collected and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for analysis. For the treatment, the 3-year-old mandarin was transplanted, and the mandarin reached high yield in the third year after transplanting. The fruit pulp (namely TOPY) and skin(namely TOSY)from trees planted on the Chengxiang Town in the third year after transplanting were also collected for subsequent analysis. All the mandarin trees were grown at the same management conditions. The trees and fruits used for phenotypic analysis were the 6-year-old and 7-year-old mandarin at the commercially mature stage. Three biological repetitions were performed for transcriptome and metabolic analysis, and six biological repetitions were completed for mineral element content analysis of skins and quality analysis of fruits. Each biological repetition contained the mixed skins or pulps powder derived from 15 fruits (three trees, five fruits from each tree). 2.2 Mineral element content analysis HR-ICP-MS (High resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) assay was performed to detecting of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Ni and Mo in a single analysis according to a previous study [ 25 ]. Briefly, the freeze-dried samples were digested using hydrogen peroxide, sulphuric acid and nitric acid (HNO 3 ) 65% in a microwave reactor UltraClave IV (MLS GmbH, Germany). Subsequently, the samples were analyzed by a sector field high resolution (HR)-ICP-MS (ELEMENT 2, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) with Software version 3.1.0.236. Element standards, including 11B, 98Mo, 23Na, 24 Mg, 31P, 32S, 44Ca, 55Mn, 56Fe, 60Ni, 63Cu, 66Zn, 39 K, 103Rh and 72Ge, were ordered from CPI-International (USA). 2.3 Analysis of total sugar, vitamin c and citric acid content in pulps and CCI (citrus color index) of the fruit skin Total sugar, vitamin c and citric acid contents were measured according to Liao et al. [ 26 ], Sir Elkhatim et al. [ 27 ] and Li et al. [ 28 ], respectively. The CCI (citrus color index) including parameters of a , b and L was measured using the Spectrophotometer (CM-700d/600d) according to the instructions. 2.4 RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed by Wuhan MetWare Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China. Total RNA of TOSP, TOSR, TOYR and TOYP were extracted using the RNAprep Pure Plant Plus Kit (DP441, TIANGEN, China) and enriched using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads following manufacturer's instruction. The NEBNext1 Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina1 (NEB, USA) was used for library construction according to the instruction. In brief, the divalent cations were used for the fragmentation of the purified mRNA under elevated temperature in First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer. The first strand cDNA and second strand cDNA synthesis were successively performed using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-) DNA polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs, respectively. Then, the 3′ ends of DNA fragments were methylated. After ligating the adaptor for hybridization, the AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA) were used for purifying the library fragments. Subsequently, The Universal PCR primers, Index (X) Primer and High-Fidelity DNA polymerase were added for PCR. After purification of the PCR products with AMPure XP system, the library quality assessment was performed with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The library sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2500™ platform (PE125, paired-end). The raw sequence reads were submitted to BioProject (number: PRJNA645612). 2.5 Reads mapping, gene expression level quantifying and differential expression analysis The dirty raw were removed according to the following criteria: ① Reads with adaptors were removing; ② Reads containing more than 10% unknown nucleotides were rejecting; ③ Reads containing over 50% low quality nucleotides (≤20) were removing. Then The HISAT2 ( http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n4/full/nmeth.3317.html ) was used for aligning the clean reads to the reference genome ( ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/493/195/GCF_000493195.1_Citrus_clementina_v ). The FPKM(Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million fragments mapped)was employed as an indicator to measure gene expression level. FPKM is calculated as follows: FPKM = mapped fragments of transctipt Total Count of mapped fragments Millions ∗ Length of transcript kb Differential expression analysis was achieved by DEGSeq, according to the criteria: |log2Fold Change| ≥ 1 and FDR < 0.05. Novel genes were excavated by StringTie through comparing the spliced transcripts with known gene in reference genome. 2.6 Analysis of carotenoids content using UPLC-MS/MS Analysis of carotenoids content was performed by Wuhan MetWare Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China. Briefly, after ground into powder using Grinding Mill(MM 400, Retsch) under low temperature, the sample was dissolved in 0.6 ml extraction buffer, a mixture of n-hexane/acetone/ethanol (1:1:2, v / v /v) containing 0.01% BHT (g/mL). Then, the standard substance was added. After shocking for 20 min at room temperature, centrifugation and concentration, the sample was dissolved in a mixture of methanol/methyl tert-butyl ether (3:1, v/v). The sample was filtrated with 0.22 μm pore size. Then, the UPLC-MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the sample extracts. The UPLC-MS/MS system comprised a ExionLC™ AD ( https://sciex.com.cn/ ) and a Applied Biosystems 4500 QTRAP® 6500+ ( https://sciex.com.cn/ ), running in ESI mode. 2.7 Analysis of IAA and ACC content using UPLC-MS/MS Analysis of IAA and ACC content was performed by Wuhan MetWare Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China. Briefly, after ground into powder using Grinding Mill(MM 400, Retsch) under low temperature, the sample was dissolved in 1 ml extraction buffer, a mixture of methanol/water/formic acid (15:4:1, v / v /v). Then, the standard substance was added. After centrifugation and concentration, the sample was dissolved in a mixture of methanol/water (4:1, v/v). The sample was filtrated with 0.22 μm pore size and placed in an injection bottle. Then, the UPLC-MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the sample extracts. The UPLC-MS/MS system comprised a ExionLC™ AD ( https://sciex.com.cn/ ) and a Applied Biosystems 4500 QTRAP® 6500+ ( https://sciex.com.cn/ ), running in ESI mode. 2.8 GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed by the GOseq using Gene Ontology database ( http://www.geneontology.org/ ). KEGG(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis of DEGs and metabolites was performed by KOBAS software using the public pathway-related database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ). 2.9 qRT-PCR analysis The expression of genes, including nine DEGs randomly selected, five differentially expressed MYB TFs and three differentially expressed bHLH TFs, was analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. cDNAs were synthesized with iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR. The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed using the fluorescent intercalating dye SYBR Green in a detection system (MJ Research, Opticon 2). Two step RT-PCR procedure was achieved as follows: 95°C for 30 s; 40×: 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s, plate read; melt curve analysis spanning 65–95°C, increment 0.5°C for 0:05 + plate read. The Actin was employed as standard control. All the gene-specific primers were designed using primer3 software ( https://primer3.ut.ee/ ) and listed in Supplementary Table 1. 2.10 Vector construction and yeast one-hybrid analysis The CsCCD4 promoter, a 1.8-kb sequence upstream the of the Ciclev10028113m.g , was isolated from the Citrus Reticulata Blanco genome by PCR. After sequence verification, the Ciclev10028113m.g promoter fragment was subcloned into pAbAi vector and then efficiently integrated into the genome of the Y1HGold yeast strain by homologous recombination. The cDNA of Ciclev10002239m.g (MYB77), Ciclev10005629m.g (MYB13), Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1), Ciclev10015648m.g (MYB34), Ciclev10009050m.g (MYB41), Ciclev10019669m.g (bHLH 91), Ciclev10007937m.g (bHLH041), Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4), Ciclev10020053m.g (PIF8) and Ciclev10019118m.g (bHLH TF) were amplified and cloned into pGADT7 vector, especially. These fusion vectors were transformed into the Y1HGold/Ciclev10028113p reporter yeast strain, specifically. When the TFs binds to the Ciclev10028113m.g promoter sequence, the GAL4 activation domain activates the expression of AbAr that is the reporter on the bait vector pAbAi. All the primers used for vector construction were listed in Supplementary Table 1. 3 Results 3.1 Transplantation induces variation in fruits nutrients concentration and fruit coloring, quality of Orah mandarin Compare to the control (TOR), the transplanted plants (TOY) leaves displayed obvious yellowing phenotype of tree ( Fig. 1 A ). The transplantation affected the coloring and quality of mandarin fruits, fruit size became smaller, per fruit weight was lower about 24%, total sugar contents was decreased 4.5%, vitamin C (V C ) and citric acid contents were increased 23% and 47%, respectively ( Fig. 1 C). Particularly, transplantation changed the color of mandarin fruit skin from orange red of control tree to yellow of transplanted plant, and the above phenotype is stable in annual repetition and multi-plot demonstration ( Figs. 1 A and B and S1). However, there was only slight difference in fruit pulps color between them. The results revealed that transplantation inhibited fruit coloring, total sugar contents but improved fruit V C and citric acid content of mandarin. The transplantation considerably declined the concentrations of nitrogen (34.0%), calcium (57.0%), sulfur (16.7%), but raised concentrations of Mg (100.0%), Mn (80.3%) and B (19.6%) in skin of mandarin ( Table 1 ). However, there was only slight difference in calcium content and sulfur content between the pulps of transplanted mandarin and the control ( Table 1 ). 3.2 RNA sequencing analysis of mandarin skins and pulps after transplantation To explore the molecular mechanism of how transplantation affects fruit development and coloring, four cDNA libraries derived from skins and pulps of TOR and TOY (namely TOSR, TOSY, TOPR and TOPY, respectively) were constructed and sequenced on a large scale. After sequencing by Illumina HiSeq, quality control, and mapping clean reads to Citrus_clementina genome ( ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/493/195/GCF_000493195.1_Citrus_clementina_v1.0 ), the detailed information of beads and probability of mapping of the 12 samples (each treatment contained three biological replications) were presented in Table S2. It was noteworthy that 2357 novel transcripts were detected ( Dataset S1 ). To explore the molecular mechanism of how transplantation affects fruit development and coloring, four cDNA libraries derived from skins and pulps of TOR and TOY (namely TOSR, TOSY, TOPR and TOPY, respectively) were constructed and sequenced on a large scale. After sequencing by Illumina HiSeq, quality control, and mapping clean reads to Citrus_clementina genome ( ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/493/195/GCF_000493195.1_Citrus_clementina_v1.0 ), the detailed information of beads and probability of mapping of the 12 samples (each treatment contained three biological replications) were presented in Table S2. It was noteworthy that 2357 novel transcripts were detected (Dataset S1). DEGs were identified using DESeq2 according to the criteria (|log2Fold Change| ≥ 1, FDR < 0.05 and the p value <0.01). As shown in Fig. 2 A and Dataset S2 , total 3156 DEGs including 2053 up-regulated genes and 1103 down-regulated genes were detected in TOSR vs TOSY. The up-regulated and down-regulated genes numbers in TOPR vs TOPY were 815 and 534, respectively ( Fig. 2 A). The Venn diagram showed that 753 genes are differentially expressed in both TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY ( Fig. 2 B). The number of DEGs in TOSR vs TOSY was larger than that in TOPR vs TOPY, indicated that transplantation mainly gave rise to altering the gene expression in mandarin fruit skin. To verify the RNA-Seq data, the expression level of nine DEGs randomly chosen was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2 C, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the relative expression patterns of the genes were consistent with RNA-Seq data, which demonstrates that the RNA-Seq data are reliable. DEGs were identified using DESeq2 according to the criteria (|log2Fold Change| ≥ 1, FDR < 0.05 and the p value <0.01). As shown in Fig. 2 A and Dataset S2, total 3156 DEGs including 2053 up-regulated genes and 1103 down-regulated genes were detected in TOSR vs TOSY. The up-regulated and down-regulated genes numbers in TOPR vs TOPY were 815 and 534, respectively ( Fig. 2 A).

The number of DEGs in TOSR vs TOSY was larger than that in TOPR vs TOPY, indicated that transplantation mainly gave rise to altering the gene expression in mandarin fruit skin. To verify the RNA-Seq data, the expression level of nine DEGs randomly chosen was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2 C, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the relative expression patterns of the genes were consistent with RNA-Seq data, which demonstrates that the RNA-Seq data are reliable. All genes were classified into annotated functional subcategories using BLAST2GO (version 2.3.5) ( http://www.blast2go.org/ ), against the background of which the GO enrichment analysis of DEGs of TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY was completed ( Fig. 2 D). Secondary metabolic process(GO:0019748) and regulation of hormone levels (GO:0010817) were two of the most abundant GO subcategories (each sub-groups included more than 100 genes) of TOSR vs TOSY ( Fig. 3 D). There were also 19, 73 and 54 DEGs related to auxin biosynthetic process (GO:0009851), hormone metabolic process (GO:0042445), hormone biosynthetic process (GO:0042446), respectively ( Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, 7 DEGs of TOSR vs TOSY are respectively relevant to carotenoid biosynthetic process (GO:0016117) ( Dataset S3 ). In detail, the expression of Ciclev10005481m.g (encoding β-carotene hydroxylase), Ciclev10022121m.g (encoding β-carotene 3-hydroxylase), Ciclev10025686m.g (encoding monooxygenase), Ciclev10028113m.g (encoding carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, CCD), Ciclev10030384m.g (encoding CCD), Ciclev10019364m.g (encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, NCED) and Ciclev10014639m.g (encoding NCED) in TOSR were higher than that in TOSY (Fig. S2). All genes were classified into annotated functional subcategories using BLAST2GO (version 2.3.5) ( http://www.blast2go.org/ ), against the background of which the GO enrichment analysis of DEGs of TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY was completed ( Fig. 2 D). Secondary metabolic process(GO:0019748) and regulation of hormone levels (GO:0010817) were two of the most abundant GO subcategories (each sub-groups included more than 100 genes) of TOSR vs TOSY ( Fig. 3 D). There were also 19, 73 and 54 DEGs related to auxin biosynthetic process (GO:0009851), hormone metabolic process (GO:0042445), hormone biosynthetic process (GO:0042446), respectively ( Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, 7 DEGs of TOSR vs TOSY are respectively relevant to carotenoid biosynthetic process (GO:0016117) (Dataset S3). In detail, the expression of Ciclev10005481m.g (encoding β-carotene hydroxylase), Ciclev10022121m.g (encoding β-carotene 3-hydroxylase), Ciclev10025686m.g (encoding monooxygenase), Ciclev10028113m.g (encoding carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, CCD), Ciclev10030384m.g (encoding CCD), Ciclev10019364m.g (encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, NCED) and Ciclev10014639m.g (encoding NCED) in TOSR were higher than that in TOSY (Fig. S2). Apparently, 4 DEGs of TOPR vs TOPY is relevant to cell proliferation (GO:0008283) which may have great effects on fruit development and size ( Fig. 2 D). In addition, the genes related to transcription regulator activity (GO:0140110) are also significantly differential expression in both TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY ( Fig. 2 D). All DEGs were mapped to the KEGG database using KOBAS 2.0 software. As shown in Fig. 3 E, the most enriched two KO terms in both TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY are biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (ko01110) and metabolic pathways (ko01100). Plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075) and carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906) are two of the most enrichment DEGs KO terms in TOSR vs TOSY ( Fig. 2 E). Some of the most enrichment DEGs KO terms in TOPR vs TOPY are plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075) and carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906) ( Fig. 2 E). It proved that transplantation greatly influenced on the expression of genes related to plant hormone signal transduction and carotenoid biosynthesis in both skins and pulps of Citrus Reticulata Blanco fruits. So, we next focus on the carotenoids biosynthesis and hormone signal transduction in skins and pulps of mandarin after transplantation. 3.3 Transplantation induces variation in fruits carotenoids metabolism, IAA and ACC level of Orah mandarin Transplantation has slight influence on the carotenoids metabolism in pulps of mandarin. As show in Table 2 , the content of β-carotene, zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin slightly decreased in fruit pulps of mandarin after transplantation, while transplantation has no influence on the content of α-carotene, (E/Z)-phytoene, γ-carotene, lutein, α-cryptoxanthin, β-citraurin and violaxanthin in fruit pulps of mandarin. Moreover, except for the slight increase of γ-carotene and α-cryptoxanthin, transplantation resulted in remarkable decrease of most carotenoids in skins of mandarin such as lutein, β-carotene, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and so on ( Table 2 ). Particularly, the content of β-citraurin as one of important pigments of citrus fruit skin was significantly decreased by transplantation ( Table 2 ). The content of β-citraurin in fruit skin of non-transplanted and transplanted mandarin was 15.7 and 0.65 ng/g (dry weight), respectively ( Table 2 ). Interestingly, transcriptome analysis showed that the expression level of Ciclev10028113m.g and Ciclev10030384m.g, encoding carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) which catalyzes the cleavage of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin yielding a red β-citraurin, in TOSY was lower than that in TOSR, which was also verified by qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. S2). Hormone plays important roles in fruits development and carotenoids metabolism [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 19–22 ]. Interestingly, the content of indoleacetic acid (IAA) increased, while the content of ACC decreased in fruit skins of mandarin after transplantation ( Fig. 3 ). 3.4 Excavating potential transcription factors (TFs) related to fruits development and coloring induced by transplantation The fruits development and coloring are complex biological processes and strictly regulated by the TFs, such as MEDs, MYB and bHLH TFs. Functional classification of DEGs proved that a large number of genes related to transcription regulator activity were significantly differential expressed in both TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY, meant TFs played important role in mandarin fruits development and coloring induced by transplantation. Based on the PlnTFDB and PlantTFDB database, all differentially expressed TFs were identified using iTAK software as shown in Fig. 4 A and 4B, a large number of differentially expressed TFs were identified in DEGs of TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY, contained 31 MYB family TFs, 23 bHLH family TFs and 11 MYB family TFs, 10 bHLH family TFs, respectively ( Fig. 4 A and B). The hierarchical clustering analysis of the 31 differentially expressed MYB family TFs of TOSR vs TOSY showed that the expression levels of Ciclev10013455m.g, Ciclev10032167m.g, Ciclev10010621m.g, Ciclev10024111m.g, Ciclev10009286m.g, Ciclev10009128m.g, Ciclev10010621m.g, Ciclev10011948m.g, Ciclev10002239m.g, Ciclev10011948m.g, Ciclev10020171m.g and Ciclev10021571m.g in TOSY were higher than that in TOSR, the expression of Ciclev10028398m.g, Ciclev10029205m.g, Ciclev10005466m.g, Ciclev10031946m.g, Ciclev10020307m.g, Ciclev10017220m.g, Ciclev10015986m.g, Ciclev10018964m.g, Ciclev10005102m.g, Ciclev10015729m.g, Ciclev10024111m.g, Ciclev10005629m.g, Ciclev10012152m.g, Ciclev10013455m.g, Ciclev10021157m.g, Ciclev10020307m.g, Ciclev10021571m.g, Ciclev10015648m.g and Ciclev10009050m.g in skin decreased by transplantation ( Fig. 4 A). While the expression of Ciclev10031295m.g, Ciclev10032167m.g, Ciclev10008806m.g, Ciclev10026112m.g, Ciclev10031120m.g, Ciclev10011948m.g, Ciclev10002239m.g and Ciclev10019219m.g in pulp increased by transplantation. The expression level of Ciclev10025950m.g, Ciclev10005102m.g and Ciclev10021157m.g in TOPY was lower than that in TOPR ( Fig. 4 B). The qRT-PCR analysis also showed that the expression of Ciclev10005629m.g (MYB13), Ciclev10015986m.g (MYB62), Ciclev10015648m.g (MYB34), Ciclev10009050m.g (MYB41), Ciclev10009050m.g (MYB041), Ciclev10027504m.g(bHLH25) and Ciclev10019118m.g (bHLH11) in skin decreased by transplantation, while the expression of Ciclev10002239m.g (MYB77) , Ciclev10024111m.g (MYB TF), Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1), Ciclev10019669m.g (bHLH91), Ciclev10025967m.g(bHLH61), Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) and Ciclev10020053m.g (PIF8) in skin increased by transplantation ( Fig. 4 C). 3.5 Correlation analysis of transcriptome and carotenoids profiling The correlation analysis between DEGs and carotenoid metabolites in both TOPR vs TOPY and TOSR vs TOSY was performed. As shown in Dataset S4 , a large number of DEGs are positively or negatively correlated with carotenoids metabolites. There are 2705 DEGs that are highly associated with β-citraurin. 1351 DEGs are positively correlated with β-citraurin, while 1354 DEGs are negatively correlated with β-citraurin. Moreover, seven differentially expressed MYB TFs and seven differentially expressed bHLH TFs are highly correlated with β-citraurin ( Table 3 ). For example, Ciclev10005629m.g (MYB13), Ciclev10015986m.g (MYB62), Ciclev10015648m.g (MYB34) and Ciclev10009050m.g (MYB41) are positively correlated with β-citraurin, while Ciclev10002239m.g (MYB77), Ciclev10024111m.g (MYB TF) and Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) are negatively correlated with β-citraurin ( Table 3 ). Moreover, Ciclev10007937m.g (bHLH041), Ciclev10027504m.g (bHLH25) and Ciclev10019118m.g (bHLH TF) are positively correlated with β-citraurin, while Ciclev10025967m.g (bHLH61), Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4), Ciclev10020053m.g (PIF8) and Ciclev10019669m.g (bHLH 91) are negatively correlated with β-citraurin ( Table 3 ). Interestingly, Ciclev10028113m.g , encoding carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, is also positively correlated with β-citraurin ( Table 3 ). The correlation analysis between DEGs and carotenoid metabolites in both TOPR vs TOPY and TOSR vs TOSY was performed. As shown in Dataset S4, a large number of DEGs are positively or negatively correlated with carotenoids metabolites. There are 2705 DEGs that are highly associated with β-citraurin. 1351 DEGs are positively correlated with β-citraurin, while 1354 DEGs are negatively correlated with β-citraurin. Moreover, seven differentially expressed MYB TFs and seven differentially expressed bHLH TFs are highly correlated with β-citraurin ( Table 3 ). For example, Ciclev10005629m.g (MYB13), Ciclev10015986m.g (MYB62), Ciclev10015648m.g (MYB34) and Ciclev10009050m.g (MYB41) are positively correlated with β-citraurin, while Ciclev10002239m.g (MYB77), Ciclev10024111m.g (MYB TF) and Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) are negatively correlated with β-citraurin ( Table 3 ). Moreover, Ciclev10007937m.g (bHLH041), Ciclev10027504m.g (bHLH25) and Ciclev10019118m.g (bHLH TF) are positively correlated with β-citraurin, while Ciclev10025967m.g (bHLH61), Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4), Ciclev10020053m.g (PIF8) and Ciclev10019669m.g (bHLH 91) are negatively correlated with β-citraurin ( Table 3 ). Interestingly, Ciclev10028113m.g , encoding carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, is also positively correlated with β-citraurin ( Table 3 ). 3.6 Ciclev10032167m.g and Ciclev10031028m.g binds directly to Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ) promoter and are regulated by IAA and ACC Because of the high correlation between β-citraurin and Ciclev10028113m.g (CCD), some MYB and bHLH TFs, we speculated that Ciclev10028113m.g (CCD) is responsible for the synthesis of β-citraurin and the regulation of Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ) by transplantation is carried out directly by Ciclev10005629m.g, Ciclev10002239m.g, Ciclev10032167m.g, Ciclev10015648m.g, Ciclev10019669m.g, Ciclev10007937m.g, Ciclev10031028m.g, Ciclev10019118m.g, Ciclev10009050m.g and/or Ciclev10020053m.g. To test this possibility, a yeast one-hybrid assay was performed. The yeast cells with the effector AD-Ciclev10032167m.g or AD-Ciclev10031028m.g and the reporter Ciclev10028113m.gp:AUR1-C (pCiclev10028113m.g1-AbAi) grew well on SD/−Leu/AbA medium. The yeast cells with the effector AD-Ciclev10005629m.g, AD-Ciclev10002239m.g, AD-Ciclev10015648m.g, AD-Ciclev10019669m.g, AD-Ciclev10007937m.g, AD-Ciclev10019118m.g, AD-Ciclev10009050m.g or AD-Ciclev10020053m.g and the reporter Ciclev10028113m.gp:AUR1-C (pCiclev10028113m.g1-AbAi) grew well on SD/−Leu medium but not on SD/−Leu/AbA medium ( Fig. 5 A and B ). These data indicated that both Ciclev10032167m.g and Ciclev10031028m.g are able to interact with Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ) promoter in yeast cells. Furthermore, exogenous IAA could induce Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) and Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) expression, but inhibits the expression of Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ) in skin of TOR and TOY ( Fig. 5 C). On the contrary, exogenous ethylene precursor ACC could induce Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ) expression , while suppressed the expression of Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) and Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) in skin of TOR and TOY ( Fig. 5 C). 4 Discussion In this study, the effect of transplantation on the growth and development of Citrus Reticulata Blanco was investigated, especially for the fruits coloring. Transplantation has a great influence on carotenoids metabolism which affect the coloring of mandarin skin and pulp. Transplantation resulted in slight decline of β-carotene, zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin in fruit pulps of mandarin. The content of γ-carotene and α-cryptoxanthin slightly increased, while the content of lutein, β-carotene, zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin decreased in fruit skins of mandarin after transplantation. Moreover, the level of β-citraurin as one of important pigments of citrus fruit skin was significantly decreased by transplantation. A large number of DEGs involved in metabolic processes of hormone signal, carotenoids biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid metabolism, MYB and bHLH family TFs were identified in pulp of transplanted tree fruits compare to the control by RNA-Seq. The correlation analysis of transcriptome and carotenoids reveals the potential correlations between the carotenoids and DEGs, including carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene ( Ciclev10030384m.g ) which catalyzes the cleavage of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin yielding a red β-citraurin, in both TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY, which provides important clues for the molecular mechanism of the fruits color change after transplantation. Calcium is one of the macroelement necessary for plant growth and development. Exogenous Ca 2+ application induced a large number of differentially expressed gene transcripts related to carotenoid biosynthesis in roots of arbuscular mycorrhizal peanut seedlings [ 29 ]. Our study showed that transplantation leaded to a considerable decline of the concentrations of calcium in fruit skin of mandarin and a slightly decline of the concentrations of calcium in pulp of mandarin, which indicates that the skin color alteration and the carotenoids metabolism changing might result from the hindered calcium assimilating after transplantation. Moreover, transplantation influenced the transcription of 11 DEGs related to calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity ( Dataset S4 ). Calcium is one of the macroelement necessary for plant growth and development. Exogenous Ca 2+ application induced a large number of differentially expressed gene transcripts related to carotenoid biosynthesis in roots of arbuscular mycorrhizal peanut seedlings [ 29 ]. Our study showed that transplantation leaded to a considerable decline of the concentrations of calcium in fruit skin of mandarin and a slightly decline of the concentrations of calcium in pulp of mandarin, which indicates that the skin color alteration and the carotenoids metabolism changing might result from the hindered calcium assimilating after transplantation. Moreover, transplantation influenced the transcription of 11 DEGs related to calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity (Dataset S4). The role of hormone on fruits development and carotenoids metabolism has been well studied [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 19–22 ]. Auxin is negatively correlated with carotenoids metabolism [ 19 ]. Endogenous application of auxin has been found to retard lycopene accumulation, while auxin antagonist (PCIB) accelerated the accumulation of lycopene in tomato fruit [ 19 ]. Our study show that a good deal of DEG is related to plant hormone signal transduction, regulation of hormone levels, hormone metabolic process and hormone biosynthetic process in both TOSR vs TOSY and TOPR vs TOPY. Moreover, 22 DEGs are related to auxin biosynthetic process in TOSR vs TOSY. The content of indoleacetic acid (IAA) increased in fruit skins of mandarin after transplantation. The above results suggest that auxin may have a great effect on the change of fruit skin coloring during transplantation. Ethylene is positively correlated with carotenoids metabolism [ 19 , 21 ]. Application of an ethylene precursor (ACC) accelerated the accumulation of lycopene in tomato fruit [ 19 ]. Some DEGs related to response ethylene are rich in TOPR vs TOPY and the content of ACC increased in fruit skins of mandarin after transplantation, which indicate that ethylene play positive roles in mandarin fruits coloring. It has been reported that there exist complex interactions between calcium and auxin during plant development [ 30–32 ]. Calcium is correlated with auxin synthesis, auxin homeostasis and auxin transporter polarity [ 31 , 32 ]. Furthermore, the role of ethylene in plant development is also related to calcium [ 33 , 34 ]. Therefore, we speculate that the change of calcium homeostasis in mandarin fruits after transplantation may affect the biosynthesis of auxin and ethylene, and then regulates mandarin fruits development and carotenoids metabolism. Transcription factor (TFs) play important roles in fruits development and coloring. Several MYB and bHLH family TFs have been shown to play vital roles in controlling carotenoids biosynthesis and determining pigmentation patterns [ 10–18 ]. In this study, the transcriptome analysis identified that transcriptional level of 32 MYB family TFs in skin and 15 MYB family TFs in pulp changed after transplantation, indicated that these MYB family TFs might have great effect on mandarin fruits development and color generation. Meanwhile, transplantation affected the expression of 23 and 11bHLH family TFs in skin and pulp, respectively. These bHLH family TFs may also participate in regulating fruits color generation by controlling carotenoids biosynthetic pathway. The expression of 19 MYB TFs and 11bHLH TFs in TOSR was lower than that in TOSY, indicated that these MYB TFs might positively regulate the carotenoids biosynthesis and their expressions were affected by transplantation. Oppositely, the transcriptional level of 13 MYB TFs and 12 bHLH TFs in skin increased after transplantation, manifested that these MYB TFs might be negatively correlated with skin color generation. Moreover, the correlation analysis show that Ciclev10005629m.g (MYB13), Ciclev10015986m.g (MYB62), Ciclev10015648m.g (MYB34), Ciclev10009050m.g (MYB41), Ciclev10007937m.g (bHLH041), Ciclev10027504m.g (bHLH25) and Ciclev10019118m.g (bHLH TF) are positively correlated with β-citraurin, while Ciclev10002239m.g (MYB77), Ciclev10024111m.g (MYB TF), Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1), Ciclev10025967m.g (bHLH61), Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4), Ciclev10020053m.g (PIF8) and Ciclev10019669m.g (bHLH 91) are negatively correlated with β-citraurin in skin of skin of mandarin. Interestingly, some negative bHLH TFs (MYB1R1, PIF4 and PIF8) correlated with carotenoids synthesis have also been reported. Our RNA-Seq analysis and qRT-PCR analysis also showed that the expression of Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1), Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) and Ciclev10020053m.g (PIF8) in skin increased by transplantation. Moreover, Y1H assay shows that Ciclev10032167m.g and Ciclev10031028m.g could bind to Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ) promoter. Therefore, Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) and Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) regulate directly the expression of Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ), thereby controlling the β-citraurin biosynthesis in fruit skin of mandarin and their expressions were affected by transplantation. Other MYB and bHLH TFs correlated with β-citraurin may indirectly regulate the β-citraurin biosynthesis in fruit skin of mandarin. It has been reported that auxin and ethylene positively or negatively regulate MYB TFs in different development process [ 10 , 35 ]. Transplantation induces the increasing of indoleacetic acid (IAA) level and decreasing of ACC level in fruit skins of mandarin. Moreover, the expression of Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) and Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) are promoted by exogenous IAA and inhibited by ACC, while IAA and ACC suppressed and accelerated the expression of Ciclev10028113m.g ( CCD ). The above results imply the role of Transplantation-Calcium-IAA/ACC-MYB1R1/PIF4-CCD signaling cascade in β-citraurin biosynthesis ( Fig. 6 ).This conjecture needs further confirmation. In conclusion, this study provides a global view of the metabolic variations associated with mandarin fruits development and coloring after transplantation ( Fig. 6 ). A comprehensive characterization of DEGs related to carotenoids metabolism, hormone signal and transcriptional regulation and the correlation analysis between DEGs and carotenoids caused by transplantation in mandarin skins and pulps has generated new data relating to mandarin development and coloring. Thus, the knowledge acquired in this study provides new rational targets for future work on mandarin fruits color improvement. 5 Conclusions The present study explored the effect of transplantation on mandarin fruits development using the integrative analyses of transcriptome and carotenoids profiling. The transplantation resulted in leaf and fruit color shallowing, smaller size and lower weight of fruit, significantly decreased fruit total sugar, ACC and calcium ion content but increased vitamin C (VC), IAA and citric acid content. Transplantation also gave rise to the alteration of carotenoids in mandarin fruit skin and pulp, which contained β-citraurin as one of the important pigments of fruit skin of mandarin. RNA-Seq and comparative analysis identified 2053 up-regulated genes, 1103 down-regulated genes in skin and 815 up-regulated genes, 534 down-regulated genes in pulp of transplanted tree fruits, which involved in metabolic processes of hormone signal, carotenoids biosynthesis, MYB and bHLH family TFs. Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) and Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) interacts with the promoter of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene ( Ciclev10028113m.g ) which is positively correlated with β-citraurin. The expression of ( Ciclev10028113m.g ), Ciclev10032167m.g (MYB1R1) and Ciclev10031028m.g (PIF4) is regulated by ACC and IAA. Integrative analyses revealed potential molecular insights into color variation with fruit development of transplantation mandarin. In conclusion, our study revealed molecular insight into relationship among variations in fruits color, quality and nutrient of Citrus Reticulata Blanco induced by transplantation, which provides important cues for future work on mandarin fruits color improvement. Further studies are needed to confirm the correlations among the transplantation induced variation in calcium ion, hormone signal, MYB and bHLH family TFs and carotenoids metabolism.
