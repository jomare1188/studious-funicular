We identified several PR1-like genes, all belonging to the\n                CRISP family within the CAP superfamily. Of them, CaCAP 2 transcript levels increased by over 300-fold in the finger\n                lime compared to ‘Valencia' sweet orange upon infection with\n                    ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus'\n                    ( Ca Las). Localization studies using an EGFP\n                fusion showed that the CAP2 protein is predominantly located in the nucleus,\n                extracellular and plasma membrane. The study also examined CAP2 transcript levels in\n                response to cold, drought stress, and salicylic acid application. Despite\n                environmental stress causing apparent damage, CAP genes seem to play a significant role in managing both biotic and abiotic stresses.\n                Analysis of CAP2 gene promoters from finger lime\n                and sweet orange revealed 95.33% sequence identity, with variations in\n                transcription factor-binding sites and cis-acting elements such as Stress Response\n                Element (STRE: AGGGG), which might influence the differential expression of CAP2 between the two species. Additionally,\n                expressing the finger lime-derived CaCAP2 gene in\n                transgenic Nicotiana tabacum induced a strong\n                defense response against Pseudomonas syringae pv.\n                Tabaci., underscoring the CAP gene's crucial role in plant defense mechanisms\n                against bacterial pathogens."

PR-1 proteins belong to the group of the most\n                abundantly produced proteins during plant defense responses. They are ubiquitous\n                across plant species and can be broadly characterized into classes (acidic or basic)\n                depending on their isoelectric point 2 . PR proteins, which are classified into 17\n                families based on their distinct characteristics, play crucial roles in the response\n                to stress conditions. Among them, PR-1 proteins are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)\n                and are part of the broader cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and\n                pathogenesis-related-1 (CAP) protein family 3 . This family represents a\n                group of secreted proteins with versatile functions. CAP domain-containing proteins,\n                exemplified by the initial structure identified in tomato P14a, exhibit fungicidal\n                        activity 4 . Typically secreted, PR-1 proteins accumulate in\n                the extracellular/apoplastic space due to their N-terminal secretion\n                        peptide 2 . However, some PR-1 proteins have been observed\n                in tobacco protoplast vacuoles and the vacuoles of specialized cells known as\n                crystal idioblasts 2 , 5 , 6 ."

Subsequent research has revealed numerous PR-1\n                proteins in various plant species, underscoring their importance in the stress\n                        response 9 , 10 – 11 . Additionally, numerous\n                studies highlight the crucial role of PR-1 proteins in fortifying plant defense\n                mechanisms against microbial threats in various crops. The overexpression of PR-1 derived from Wasabia japonica L. enhances resistance against Botrytis cinerea in tobacco plants, suggesting the\n                antifungal effect of the PR-1 gene 12 . The overexpression of the pepper gene CABPR-1 resulted in increased resistance against the\n                oomycete pathogen Phytophthora nicotianae , as\n                well as heightened tolerance to bacterial pathogens such as Ralstonia solanacearum and Pseudomonas\n                    syringae pv.

The citrus industry is threatened by various abiotic and biotic stressors.\n                Huanglongbing (HLB) is a highly destructive disease that causes significant economic\n                losses in citrus industries worldwide 20 .

Plant defense resources\n                include the accumulation of defense molecules, modulation of the plant signaling\n                system, adjustments in primary and secondary metabolite levels, and various\n                biochemical and physiological modifications 25 , 26 – 27 . One crucial aspect of this defense is the\n                synthesis and accumulation of defense molecules, such as antimicrobial peptides and\n                secondary metabolites, which act as deterrents or directly impede the proliferation\n                of the pathogen 28 , 29 . This response plays a vital role in inhibiting\n                the growth and survival of Ca Las within citrus\n                trees. Understanding the complexities of these defense mechanisms is essential for\n                developing strategies to increase the natural tolerance of citrus plants to HLB and\n                its causative agent. Our recent transcriptomic analysis of HLB-tolerant Australian\n                finger lime ( Citrus australasica ) and\n                HLB-susceptible ‘Valencia' sweet orange revealed specific redox control\n                systems and the activation of genes responsible for the production of Cys-rich\n                secretory proteins and PR-1 proteins against Ca Las infection."

The analysis\n                    confirmed that all identified proteins possess a CAP superfamily domain\n                    (PF00188) according to the Pfam database and exhibit the SCP/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7\n                    family of extracellular domains structure (SM000198) according to the SMART\n                    database (Fig. 1 B).

Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining was used to\n                    confirm the in situ histochemical localization of\n                        O 2 •− in the\n                    leaves. This observation confirmed the greater accumulation of\n                        O 2 •− in\n                    young leaves than in mature leaves (Fig. 3 E,F). Additionally, we examined the differential expression\n                    of Egl122180.1 via qPCR at five-time points to demonstrate its involvement in\n                    cold adaptation. The relative expression of Egl122180.1 gradually increased in\n                    response to cold stress, and there was no significant difference between the\n                    young and mature leaves (Fig. 3 G,\n                    Figure S4). The young and mature leaves of finger lime trees were sensitive to\n                    PEG treatment (Fig. 3 H, Figure\n                    S5) Additionally, we recorded increased\n                        H 2 O 2 content and decreased\n                    DPPH scavenging capacity ratio following cold exposure (Fig. 3 I,J). We observed leaf drop after 30 days of PEG\n                    treatment. At the molecular level, the expression of the CAP2 gene gradually increased, a finding similar to that\n                    observed in response to cold stress. Compared with that of the control, the\n                    expression of this gene was upregulated after 15 and 30 days\n                        (Fig. 3 K).

We recorded low\n                    expression after 15 and 30 days of salicylic acid treatment\n                        (Fig. 3 L, Figure S6)."

            "text": "To further investigate the function of the CaCAP2 gene in response to biotic stress, we generated\n                    transgenic tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) lines.\n                    Following the transformation and successful regeneration of the transgenic\n                    plants, the expression and functionality of the introduced transgenes were\n                    investigated. Transgenic lines of tobacco were initially screened based on the\n                    presence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for successful gene\n                    integration. A subset of 10 plantlets expressing enhanced green fluorescent\n                    protein (EGFP) was subsequently randomly selected for further analysis. Genomic\n                    DNA (gDNA) was extracted from these plantlets, and PCR was conducted to\n                    determine the presence of the CaCAP2 gene.\n                    PCR analysis of the gDNA samples revealed that three plant lines were positive\n                    for the presence of the CaCAP2 gene. The\n                    expression of CaCAP2 remains high in the\n                    transgenic plants compared to the wild-type however it showed a decrease\n                    relative to non-infected control transgenic plants Figure S4. This suggests that CaCAP2 expression is affected by the\n                    infection, potentially due to stress-induced repression or other regulatory\n                    mechanisms. Following the confirmation of gene integration, one line was\n                    selected for further evaluation and subsequent experiments\n                        (Fig. 4 A, S3). An obvious\n                    change was observed in response to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tabaci. when comparing the wild-type\n                    and the transgenic lines (Fig. 4 B,C,D,E,F,G). We recorded a lower colony-forming unit (CFU)count\n                    of Pseudomonas , indicating reduced growth, in\n                    the leaf discs of the transgenic line than in those of the control\n                        (Fig. 4 H). Additionally, the\n                    calculation of leaf disease damage revealed less damage in the transgenic line\n                    in response to Pseudomonas infection, along\n                    with a lower MDA content, than in the wild-type (Fig. 4 I, J). There was no significant difference\n                    between the wild-type and the transgenic line in terms of electrolyte leakage\n                    from the leaves (Fig. 4 K)."

A similar\n                    trend was observed in the DPPH-radical scavenging activity, which significantly\n                    increased at a greater level in the wild-type plants than in the transgenic\n                    plants following Pseudomonas infection\n                        (Fig. 5 E). Assessing the\n                    induced oxidative response through total phenolic compound (TPC) content\n                    determination revealed a significant increase in both the wild-type and\n                    transgenic lines post-infection, with the wild-type exhibiting greater TPC\n                    content than the transgenic line (Fig. 5 F). Additionally, we studied the relative gene expression\n                    levels of selected defense-related proteins in tobacco (WT and Transgenic\n                    plants) in response to Pseudomonas infection.\n                    The heatmap shows the upregulation of thaumatin, PR-4B , and WRKY71 in CaCAP2 transgenic tobacco compared with\n                    those in healthy control tobacco. However, all the tested WRKY transcription factors were upregulated in the\n                    wild-type in response to Pseudomonas infection by spraying the bacterial suspension (Fig. 5 G). CFU is negatively correlated with\n                    chlorophyll content, the relative expression of thaumatin, and WRKY\n                    transcription factors. However, it positively correlates with DPPH%, TPC\n                    content, and the relative expression of WIN1-like and PR1-like\n                        (Fig. 5 H)."

            "text": "Owing to the differential expression observed between finger lime\n                    and other HLB-sensitive species, such as sweet orange, we conducted a study to\n                    identify the cis-acting elements within their promoters. By analyzing these\n                    promoter regions, we aimed to elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms\n                    contributing to the observed differences in gene expression patterns between\n                    these citrus species. The promoter regions of the CAP2 gene in both finger lime (Egl122180.1) and sweet orange\n                    (Cs8g_pb004840.1) were analyzed. A 2000-bp sequence was obtained and compared\n                    with both species' CAP2 gene cDNA and\n                    upstream sequences. A total of 95.33% identity and 2.76% gaps were\n                    observed when the sequences of the two promoters were compared\n                        (Fig. 6 C, Supplementary\n                    Material 1). The analysis revealed slight variations in their linear\n                    discriminant function (LDF) scores, indicative of differences in the local\n                    concentration or distribution pattern of sequence motifs associated with\n                    transcription factor-binding sites. Finger lime sequences presented an LDF score\n                    of 0.02, whereas sweet orange sequences presented a slightly higher LDF score of\n                    0.05. Furthermore, we identified unique transcription factor-binding sites\n                    specific to each species. CAP2 promoter regulatory element analysis revealed\n                    various functional cis-acting elements, including the core cis-acting elements.\n                    Finger lime has a relatively high abundance of certain elements, such as Box 4\n                    (ATTAAT) and STRE (AGGGG), which are involved in gene expression regulation and\n                    stress response, respectively. Sweet orange, on the other hand, presents\n                    relatively high counts of elements such as the CGTCA motif and TGA element\n                    (AACGAC), which are associated with light-regulated gene expression and defense\n                    responses. Both species share common elements, such as CAAT- and MYB-binding\n                    sites, which are essential for general transcriptional regulation and stress\n                    responses. These variations in cis-acting elements suggest distinct regulatory\n                    mechanisms that may contribute to the observed differential expression patterns\n                    of the CAP2 gene between finger lime and\n                    sweet orange (Table 3 )."

AZM\n                    genome v1.0), retrieved from the Citrus Pangenome to Breeding Database (CPBD)\n                        (Fig. 1 A, Table S1 ). The nomenclature system for these genes\n                    was based on the CAP domain. As such, we designated the genes CaCAP1 , CaCAP2 , CaCAP3 , etc., to differentiate each gene\n                    on the basis of homologous sequences retrieved from the database. The analysis\n                    confirmed that all identified proteins possess a CAP superfamily domain\n                    (PF00188) according to the Pfam database and exhibit the SCP/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7\n                    family of extracellular domains structure (SM000198) according to the SMART\n                    database (Fig. 1 B). The molecular\n                    weights of the CAP proteins were approximately 17.38 kDa, with protein\n                    lengths ranging from 160 to 166 amino acid residues. Quantitative PCR analyses\n                    of representative CAP genes after Ca Las\n                    infection in different citrus species naturally infected with Ca Las revealed the upregulation of Egl122180.1\n                        ( CaCAP2 ) specifically in C. glauca , followed by C.\n                        australasica (Fig. 1 C). The expression of CAP2 was positively correlated with the Ct value of Ca Las (Fig. 1 D). To elucidate the conservation and variability of CAP2 within the Citrus genus, we obtained sequences from various citrus species\n                    closely resembling the gene of interest, CaCAP2 (Egl122180.1: chromosome 8). The phylogenetic tree\n                    revealed a close relationship between the finger lime gene and orthologs in C. australis , C.\n                        inodora , and C. glauca . This\n                    clustering suggests a shared evolutionary history and genetic similarity among\n                    these citrus species (Fig. 1 E,\n                    S1)."

Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining was used to\n                    confirm the in situ histochemical localization of\n                        O 2 •− in the\n                    leaves. This observation confirmed the greater accumulation of\n                        O 2 •− in\n                    young leaves than in mature leaves (Fig. 3 E,F).

The relative expression of Egl122180.1 gradually increased in\n                    response to cold stress, and there was no significant difference between the\n                    young and mature leaves (Fig. 3 G,\n                    Figure S4). The young and mature leaves of finger lime trees were sensitive to\n                    PEG treatment (Fig. 3 H, Figure\n                    S5) Additionally, we recorded increased\n                        H 2 O 2 content and decreased\n                    DPPH scavenging capacity ratio following cold exposure (Fig. 3 I,J). We observed leaf drop after 30 days of PEG\n                    treatment. At the molecular level, the expression of the CAP2 gene gradually increased, a finding similar to that\n                    observed in response to cold stress.

Transgenic lines of tobacco were initially screened based on the\n                    presence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for successful gene\n                    integration. A subset of 10 plantlets expressing enhanced green fluorescent\n                    protein (EGFP) was subsequently randomly selected for further analysis. Genomic\n                    DNA (gDNA) was extracted from these plantlets, and PCR was conducted to\n                    determine the presence of the CaCAP2 gene.\n                    PCR analysis of the gDNA samples revealed that three plant lines were positive\n                    for the presence of the CaCAP2 gene. The\n                    expression of CaCAP2 remains high in the\n                    transgenic plants compared to the wild-type however it showed a decrease\n                    relative to non-infected control transgenic plants Figure S4. This suggests that CaCAP2 expression is affected by the\n                    infection, potentially due to stress-induced repression or other regulatory\n                    mechanisms. Following the confirmation of gene integration, one line was\n                    selected for further evaluation and subsequent experiments\n                        (Fig. 4 A, S3). An obvious\n                    change was observed in response to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tabaci. when comparing the wild-type\n                    and the transgenic lines (Fig. 4 B,C,D,E,F,G). We recorded a lower colony-forming unit (CFU)count\n                    of Pseudomonas , indicating reduced growth, in\n                    the leaf discs of the transgenic line than in those of the control\n                        (Fig. 4 H). Additionally, the\n                    calculation of leaf disease damage revealed less damage in the transgenic line\n                    in response to Pseudomonas infection, along\n                    with a lower MDA content, than in the wild-type (Fig. 4 I, J).

Assessing the\n                    induced oxidative response through total phenolic compound (TPC) content\n                    determination revealed a significant increase in both the wild-type and\n                    transgenic lines post-infection, with the wild-type exhibiting greater TPC\n                    content than the transgenic line (Fig. 5 F). Additionally, we studied the relative gene expression\n                    levels of selected defense-related proteins in tobacco (WT and Transgenic\n                    plants) in response to Pseudomonas infection.\n                    The heatmap shows the upregulation of thaumatin, PR-4B , and WRKY71 in CaCAP2 transgenic tobacco compared with\n                    those in healthy control tobacco. However, all the tested WRKY transcription factors were upregulated in the\n                    wild-type in response to Pseudomonas infection by spraying the bacterial suspension (Fig. 5 G). CFU is negatively correlated with\n                    chlorophyll content, the relative expression of thaumatin, and WRKY\n                    transcription factors. However, it positively correlates with DPPH%, TPC\n                    content, and the relative expression of WIN1-like and PR1-like\n                        (Fig. 5 H)."

                "text": "Owing to the differential expression observed between finger lime\n                    and other HLB-sensitive species, such as sweet orange, we conducted a study to\n                    identify the cis-acting elements within their promoters. By analyzing these\n                    promoter regions, we aimed to elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms\n                    contributing to the observed differences in gene expression patterns between\n                    these citrus species. The promoter regions of the CAP2 gene in both finger lime (Egl122180.1) and sweet orange\n                    (Cs8g_pb004840.1) were analyzed. A 2000-bp sequence was obtained and compared\n                    with both species' CAP2 gene cDNA and\n                    upstream sequences. A total of 95.33% identity and 2.76% gaps were\n                    observed when the sequences of the two promoters were compared\n                        (Fig. 6 C, Supplementary\n                    Material 1). The analysis revealed slight variations in their linear\n                    discriminant function (LDF) scores, indicative of differences in the local\n                    concentration or distribution pattern of sequence motifs associated with\n                    transcription factor-binding sites. Finger lime sequences presented an LDF score\n                    of 0.02, whereas sweet orange sequences presented a slightly higher LDF score of\n                    0.05. Furthermore, we identified unique transcription factor-binding sites\n                    specific to each species. CAP2 promoter regulatory element analysis revealed\n                    various functional cis-acting elements, including the core cis-acting elements.\n                    Finger lime has a relatively high abundance of certain elements, such as Box 4\n                    (ATTAAT) and STRE (AGGGG), which are involved in gene expression regulation and\n                    stress response, respectively. Sweet orange, on the other hand, presents\n                    relatively high counts of elements such as the CGTCA motif and TGA element\n                    (AACGAC), which are associated with light-regulated gene expression and defense\n                    responses. Both species share common elements, such as CAAT- and MYB-binding\n                    sites, which are essential for general transcriptional regulation and stress\n                    responses. These variations in cis-acting elements suggest distinct regulatory\n                    mechanisms that may contribute to the observed differential expression patterns\n                    of the CAP2 gene between finger lime and\n                    sweet orange (Table 3 )."

AZM\n                    genome v1.0), retrieved from the Citrus Pangenome to Breeding Database (CPBD)\n                        (Fig. 1 A, Table S1 ). The nomenclature system for these genes\n                    was based on the CAP domain. As such, we designated the genes CaCAP1 , CaCAP2 , CaCAP3 , etc., to differentiate each gene\n                    on the basis of homologous sequences retrieved from the database. The analysis\n                    confirmed that all identified proteins possess a CAP superfamily domain\n                    (PF00188) according to the Pfam database and exhibit the SCP/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7\n                    family of extracellular domains structure (SM000198) according to the SMART\n                    database (Fig. 1 B). The molecular\n                    weights of the CAP proteins were approximately 17.38 kDa, with protein\n                    lengths ranging from 160 to 166 amino acid residues. Quantitative PCR analyses\n                    of representative CAP genes after Ca Las\n                    infection in different citrus species naturally infected with Ca Las revealed the upregulation of Egl122180.1\n                        ( CaCAP2 ) specifically in C. glauca , followed by C.\n                        australasica (Fig. 1 C). The expression of CAP2 was positively correlated with the Ct value of Ca Las (Fig. 1 D). To elucidate the conservation and variability of CAP2 within the Citrus genus, we obtained sequences from various citrus species\n                    closely resembling the gene of interest, CaCAP2 (Egl122180.1: chromosome 8). The phylogenetic tree\n                    revealed a close relationship between the finger lime gene and orthologs in C. australis , C.\n                        inodora , and C. glauca . This\n                    clustering suggests a shared evolutionary history and genetic similarity among\n                    these citrus species (Fig. 1 E,\n                    S1)."

Transgenic lines of tobacco were initially screened based on the\n                    presence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for successful gene\n                    integration. A subset of 10 plantlets expressing enhanced green fluorescent\n                    protein (EGFP) was subsequently randomly selected for further analysis. Genomic\n                    DNA (gDNA) was extracted from these plantlets, and PCR was conducted to\n                    determine the presence of the CaCAP2 gene.\n                    PCR analysis of the gDNA samples revealed that three plant lines were positive\n                    for the presence of the CaCAP2 gene. The\n                    expression of CaCAP2 remains high in the\n                    transgenic plants compared to the wild-type however it showed a decrease\n                    relative to non-infected control transgenic plants Figure S4. This suggests that CaCAP2 expression is affected by the\n                    infection, potentially due to stress-induced repression or other regulatory\n                    mechanisms. Following the confirmation of gene integration, one line was\n                    selected for further evaluation and subsequent experiments\n                        (Fig. 4 A, S3). An obvious\n                    change was observed in response to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv.

Compared with those\n                    in the transgenic line, the chlorophyll a (CHL a ), chlorophyll b (CHL b ), carotenoid, and\n                    total chlorophyll contents in the wild-type were notably lower\n                        (Fig. 5 A, B, C, D). A similar\n                    trend was observed in the DPPH-radical scavenging activity, which significantly\n                    increased at a greater level in the wild-type plants than in the transgenic\n                    plants following Pseudomonas infection\n                        (Fig. 5 E).

            "text": "Owing to the differential expression observed between finger lime\n                    and other HLB-sensitive species, such as sweet orange, we conducted a study to\n                    identify the cis-acting elements within their promoters. By analyzing these\n                    promoter regions, we aimed to elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms\n                    contributing to the observed differences in gene expression patterns between\n                    these citrus species. The promoter regions of the CAP2 gene in both finger lime (Egl122180.1) and sweet orange\n                    (Cs8g_pb004840.1) were analyzed. A 2000-bp sequence was obtained and compared\n                    with both species' CAP2 gene cDNA and\n                    upstream sequences. A total of 95.33% identity and 2.76% gaps were\n                    observed when the sequences of the two promoters were compared\n                        (Fig. 6 C, Supplementary\n                    Material 1). The analysis revealed slight variations in their linear\n                    discriminant function (LDF) scores, indicative of differences in the local\n                    concentration or distribution pattern of sequence motifs associated with\n                    transcription factor-binding sites. Finger lime sequences presented an LDF score\n                    of 0.02, whereas sweet orange sequences presented a slightly higher LDF score of\n                    0.05. Furthermore, we identified unique transcription factor-binding sites\n                    specific to each species. CAP2 promoter regulatory element analysis revealed\n                    various functional cis-acting elements, including the core cis-acting elements.\n                    Finger lime has a relatively high abundance of certain elements, such as Box 4\n                    (ATTAAT) and STRE (AGGGG), which are involved in gene expression regulation and\n                    stress response, respectively. Sweet orange, on the other hand, presents\n                    relatively high counts of elements such as the CGTCA motif and TGA element\n                    (AACGAC), which are associated with light-regulated gene expression and defense\n                    responses. Both species share common elements, such as CAAT- and MYB-binding\n                    sites, which are essential for general transcriptional regulation and stress\n                    responses. These variations in cis-acting elements suggest distinct regulatory\n                    mechanisms that may contribute to the observed differential expression patterns\n                    of the CAP2 gene between finger lime and\n                    sweet orange (Table 3 )."

This group is also referred to as the SCP protein family (sperm coating\n                glycoprotein family; Pfam: PF00188) 3 . In our recent study, specific genes sharing\n                the CAP domain were significantly upregulated in finger lime trees (HLB-tolerant\n                variety) compared with those in ‘Valencia' sweet orange (HLB-susceptible\n                variety) upon infection with Ca Las 31 . Moreover, we observed a negative\n                correlation between the titer of Ca Las and the\n                expression of CAP2 genes. Interestingly, the CAP2 gene of desert lime (HLB-resistant\n                variety) are significantly upregulated, and that upregulation is linked to desert\n                lime tolerance of HLB disease. This study highlights the potential of\n                pathogenesis-related proteins, particularly cysteine-rich secretory and\n                pathogenesis-related proteins (CAPs), in the enhancement of plant defense mechanisms\n                against pathogens and environmental stressors for sustainable agricultural\n                production. The biochemical activity and mode of action of PR-1 proteins have\n                remained elusive. However, numerous studies indicate that these proteins can bind to\n                sterols, contain a built-in defense signaling peptide, and are targeted by plant\n                pathogens when the host is infected 2 , 37 , 38 ."

These proteins\n                include Hevein-like preproprotein-like, Ras-related protein RABC1-like isoform X1,\n                Thaumatin-like protein 1-like, and Threonine dehydratase biosynthetic. Haven-like\n                proteins, derived from the name of the original member, the “HAVEN”\n                (Hevein Antifungal Protein). These proteins typically characterized by\n                chitin-binding domains, haven-like proteins play essential roles in plant defense\n                mechanisms against fungal pathogens by recognizing and binding to chitin and\n                contributes to broader defense responses 43 , 44 . Moreover, haven-like proteins have been served\n                as potential antimicrobial peptides 45 . Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) play a\n                crucial role in enhancing plant resistance against fungal pathogens, offering a\n                promising avenue for developing disease-resistant crop\n                        varieties 46 . Threonine dehydratase is a key player in plant\n                defense, influencing both allelopathic interactions and responses to herbivores. Its\n                role extends beyond isoleucine biosynthesis, impacting the delicate balance of plant\n                survival and growth 47 . Threonine ammonia-lyase is a key component of\n                plant defense mechanisms against herbivores and is triggered by abiotic stress.\n                Plants express a specialized isoform of this enzyme in their leaves, which has\n                unique properties aimed at deterring herbivores. While the catalytic domain remains\n                highly resistant to proteolysis; the regulatory domain degrades easily. Therefore,\n                when ingested by herbivores, the enzyme's threonine deamination function proceeds\n                unchecked, breaking down threonine before the herbivore can utilize it, ultimately\n                depriving them of this essential amino acid 48 ."

The sequences were aligned with the sequences\n                    of citrus species. To confirm the presence of the obtained CAP proteins, we\n                    examined the presence of domain structures from the Pfam 32.0 ( http://pfam.xfam.org ) and UniProt Release 2023_05 ( https://www.uniprot.org/ ) databases. The physicochemical properties of the CAP2 protein were analyzed via the ProtParam server ( http://web.expasy.org/protparam ). The conserved motifs of the PR-1 proteins were identified via\n                    the Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) server v5.5.5 ( http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme ) (Fig. S2 ) 58 .

Evolutionary relationships of the CAP\n                    proteins were determined via MEGAX 11 software, and alignments were generated\n                    via a built-in CLUSTALW implementation and the MUSCLE program.

PR-1 proteins belong to the group of the most\n                abundantly produced proteins during plant defense responses. They are ubiquitous\n                across plant species and can be broadly characterized into classes (acidic or basic)\n                depending on their isoelectric point 2 . PR proteins, which are classified into 17\n                families based on their distinct characteristics, play crucial roles in the response\n                to stress conditions. Among them, PR-1 proteins are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)\n                and are part of the broader cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and\n                pathogenesis-related-1 (CAP) protein family 3 . This family represents a\n                group of secreted proteins with versatile functions. CAP domain-containing proteins,\n                exemplified by the initial structure identified in tomato P14a, exhibit fungicidal\n                        activity 4 . Typically secreted, PR-1 proteins accumulate in\n                the extracellular/apoplastic space due to their N-terminal secretion\n                        peptide 2 . However, some PR-1 proteins have been observed\n                in tobacco protoplast vacuoles and the vacuoles of specialized cells known as\n                crystal idioblasts 2 , 5 , 6 . The identification of PR-1 proteins began with the discovery of the\n                first member, PR1-a, in Nicotiana tabacum infected with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 7 , 8 . Subsequent research has revealed numerous PR-1\n                proteins in various plant species, underscoring their importance in the stress\n                        response 9 , 10 – 11 . Additionally, numerous\n                studies highlight the crucial role of PR-1 proteins in fortifying plant defense\n                mechanisms against microbial threats in various crops. The overexpression of PR-1 derived from Wasabia japonica L. enhances resistance against Botrytis cinerea in tobacco plants, suggesting the\n                antifungal effect of the PR-1 gene 12 . The overexpression of the pepper gene CABPR-1 resulted in increased resistance against the\n                oomycete pathogen Phytophthora nicotianae , as\n                well as heightened tolerance to bacterial pathogens such as Ralstonia solanacearum and Pseudomonas\n                    syringae pv. Tabaci 13 . Additionally, ectopic expression of the PR-1 gene of Oryza\n                    grandiglumis ( OgPR-1a ) confers\n                disease resistance to bacterial and fungal infections in\n                        Arabidopsis 14 . In addition to their role in biotic stress responses, PR-1 proteins are\n                recognized for their role in responses to abiotic stresses 15 . The plasma\n                membrane-tethered NAC transcription factor NTL6 induces the expression of PR genes in response to cold\n                        stress 16 . The expression of TaPR1-1 in wheat is induced by freezing, salinity, and osmotic\n                stresses, providing tolerance upon overexpression 17 . A study on\n                drought-stressed Fusarium oxysporum -sensitive and F. oxysporum -tolerant tomato varieties\n                revealed substantial upregulation of all SlPR-1 genes, up to 50-fold, under drought stress 18 . In tomatoes,\n                pathogenesis-related protein 1b1 ( PR-1b1 )\n                increases post-warming under chilling temperatures 19 . Major citrus production in the United States, concentrated in Florida,\n                California, and Texas, includes sweet oranges, grapefruits, mandarins, lemons, and\n                limes. The citrus industry is threatened by various abiotic and biotic stressors.\n                Huanglongbing (HLB) is a highly destructive disease that causes significant economic\n                losses in citrus industries worldwide 20 . This disease is caused by ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter' species, which are fastidious\n                and gram-negative α-proteobacteria, phloem-limited, and not yet able to be\n                        cultured 20 , 21 . Three distinct bacterial species responsible\n                for HLB have been identified on the basis of characteristic 16 S rDNA\n                sequences and geographic distribution: ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' ( Ca Las), ‘ Ca. Liberibacter\n                americanus', and ‘ Ca. Liberibacter\n                        africanus' 22 , 23 . HLB poses a severe threat to citrus crops\n                globally because of its rapid spread and devastating impact on fruit quality and\n                        yield 20 . The inability to culture ‘ Ca. Liberibacter' species complicates research efforts,\n                making it challenging to develop effective control\n                        strategies 20 . Citrus plants have evolved an innate immune system characterized by\n                multilayered and complex defense responses to counteract the detrimental effects of Ca Las infection and its vector, Diaphorina citri 24 . Plant defense resources\n                include the accumulation of defense molecules, modulation of the plant signaling\n                system, adjustments in primary and secondary metabolite levels, and various\n                biochemical and physiological modifications 25 , 26 – 27 . One crucial aspect of this defense is the\n                synthesis and accumulation of defense molecules, such as antimicrobial peptides and\n                secondary metabolites, which act as deterrents or directly impede the proliferation\n                of the pathogen 28 , 29 . This response plays a vital role in inhibiting\n                the growth and survival of Ca Las within citrus\n                trees. Understanding the complexities of these defense mechanisms is essential for\n                developing strategies to increase the natural tolerance of citrus plants to HLB and\n                its causative agent. Our recent transcriptomic analysis of HLB-tolerant Australian\n                finger lime ( Citrus australasica ) and\n                HLB-susceptible ‘Valencia' sweet orange revealed specific redox control\n                systems and the activation of genes responsible for the production of Cys-rich\n                secretory proteins and PR-1 proteins against Ca Las infection. Since the Australian finger lime shows tolerance to\n                        HLB 30 , we hypothesize that its genome possesses\n                tolerance-related genes whose transcripts are enriched compared to those in HLB\n                susceptible varieties 31 . These transcripts may ultimately be transferred\n                to other cultivars if finger lime is used in conventional breeding to enhance HLB\n                tolerance. In this study, we used our prior RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based\n                information (PRJNA755969) 31 and conducted a comprehensive bioinformatic\n                analyses of PR-1 genes in Citrus species, with an\n                emphasis on the expression in finger lime in response to both biotic and abiotic\n                stresses. Furthermore, the overexpression of a finger lime CAP transcript in tobacco plants was analyzed to confirm the\n                functionality of the PR-1 protein. Results Analysis of CAP genes in different\n                    citrus cultivars We identified 12 CAP genes encoding PR1-like proteins in the finger\n                    lime genome ( Citrus australasica cv. AZM\n                    genome v1.0), retrieved from the Citrus Pangenome to Breeding Database (CPBD)\n                        (Fig. 1 A, Table S1 ). The nomenclature system for these genes\n                    was based on the CAP domain. As such, we designated the genes CaCAP1 , CaCAP2 , CaCAP3 , etc., to differentiate each gene\n                    on the basis of homologous sequences retrieved from the database. The analysis\n                    confirmed that all identified proteins possess a CAP superfamily domain\n                    (PF00188) according to the Pfam database and exhibit the SCP/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7\n                    family of extracellular domains structure (SM000198) according to the SMART\n                    database (Fig. 1 B). The molecular\n                    weights of the CAP proteins were approximately 17.38 kDa, with protein\n                    lengths ranging from 160 to 166 amino acid residues. Quantitative PCR analyses\n                    of representative CAP genes after Ca Las\n                    infection in different citrus species naturally infected with Ca Las revealed the upregulation of Egl122180.1\n                        ( CaCAP2 ) specifically in C. glauca , followed by C.\n                        australasica (Fig. 1 C). The expression of CAP2 was positively correlated with the Ct value of Ca Las (Fig. 1 D). To elucidate the conservation and variability of CAP2 within the Citrus genus, we obtained sequences from various citrus species\n                    closely resembling the gene of interest, CaCAP2 (Egl122180.1: chromosome 8). The phylogenetic tree\n                    revealed a close relationship between the finger lime gene and orthologs in C. australis , C.\n                        inodora , and C. glauca . This\n                    clustering suggests a shared evolutionary history and genetic similarity among\n                    these citrus species (Fig. 1 E,\n                    S1).

The phylogenetic trees were generated\n                                    by the neighbor‒joining clustering method via MEGA\n                                    11.0.13. Differential expression of the CAP2 gene\n                    in response to Huanglongbing disease We collected leaf samples from symptomatic ‘Valencia' trees\n                    with an average Ct value of 25.14 for ( Ca Las)\n                    detection. In comparison with ‘Valencia' sweet orange, finger lime trees\n                    presented elevated Ct values (Fig. 2 A). Additionally, we recorded a higher level of\n                        H 2 O 2 in the infected leaves of\n                    ‘Valencia' trees than in those of finger lime leaves\n                        (Fig. 2 B). Conversely, the\n                    2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging capacity was greater in finger\n                    lime leaves than in ‘Valencia' leaves in response to Ca Las infection (Fig. 2 C). We observed the upregulation of CAP2 and three candidates of Hevein-like\n                    preproprotein-like genes in the HLB-positive finger lime group and one other\n                    candidate in the HLB-negative finger lime group (Fig. 2 D). Additionally, the pathogenesis-related group\n                    5 protein, thaumatin type (orange1.1g026037m), was upregulated in the finger\n                    lime group following Ca Las infection. The\n                    Ras-related protein RABC1-like isoform X1 genes (orange1.1g027908m,\n                    orange1.1g027985m, and orange1.1g028300m) were upregulated in infected finger\n                    lime. Conversely, the RABC1 genes (orange1.1g028792m and orange1.1g043946m) were\n                    downregulated in infected finger lime. We also demonstrated the upregulation of\n                    WRKY transcription factors in response to Ca Las infection in finger lime (Fig. 2 D). Fig. 2 Comparative analysis of Ca Las infection response in finger lime and\n                                    ‘Valencia' sweet orange in the context of controlled\n                                    greenhouse infection.

( D ) A heatmap showing the differential\n                                    expression patterns of CAP gene homologs highlights significant\n                                    upregulation in infected finger lime compared with\n                                    ‘Valencia' sweet orange. ( E ) A heatmap showing the differential expression\n                                    patterns of CAP2 gene and\n                                    other defense-related genes in infected finger lime compared\n                                    with ‘Valencia' sweet orange. Differential expression of the CAP2 gene\n                    in response to abiotic stress We demonstrated that young leaves of finger lime are more sensitive\n                    to cold stress than mature leaves (Fig. 3 A,B,C,D). Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining was used to\n                    confirm the in situ histochemical localization of\n                        O 2 •− in the\n                    leaves. This observation confirmed the greater accumulation of\n                        O 2 •− in\n                    young leaves than in mature leaves (Fig. 3 E,F). Additionally, we examined the differential expression\n                    of Egl122180.1 via qPCR at five-time points to demonstrate its involvement in\n                    cold adaptation. The relative expression of Egl122180.1 gradually increased in\n                    response to cold stress, and there was no significant difference between the\n                    young and mature leaves (Fig. 3 G,\n                    Figure S4). The young and mature leaves of finger lime trees were sensitive to\n                    PEG treatment (Fig. 3 H, Figure\n                    S5) Additionally, we recorded increased\n                        H 2 O 2 content and decreased\n                    DPPH scavenging capacity ratio following cold exposure (Fig. 3 I,J). We observed leaf drop after 30 days of PEG\n                    treatment. At the molecular level, the expression of the CAP2 gene gradually increased, a finding similar to that\n                    observed in response to cold stress. Compared with that of the control, the\n                    expression of this gene was upregulated after 15 and 30 days\n                        (Fig. 3 K). The same\n                    observation was recorded upon salicylic acid treatment, as we observed a\n                    significant up-regulation in the relative expression of CAP2 compared with that in the control trees. We recorded low\n                    expression after 15 and 30 days of salicylic acid treatment\n                        (Fig. 3 L, Figure S6).

Overexpression of the CaCAP2 gene in\n                    tobacco To further investigate the function of the CaCAP2 gene in response to biotic stress, we generated\n                    transgenic tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) lines.\n                    Following the transformation and successful regeneration of the transgenic\n                    plants, the expression and functionality of the introduced transgenes were\n                    investigated. Transgenic lines of tobacco were initially screened based on the\n                    presence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for successful gene\n                    integration. A subset of 10 plantlets expressing enhanced green fluorescent\n                    protein (EGFP) was subsequently randomly selected for further analysis. Genomic\n                    DNA (gDNA) was extracted from these plantlets, and PCR was conducted to\n                    determine the presence of the CaCAP2 gene.\n                    PCR analysis of the gDNA samples revealed that three plant lines were positive\n                    for the presence of the CaCAP2 gene. The\n                    expression of CaCAP2 remains high in the\n                    transgenic plants compared to the wild-type however it showed a decrease\n                    relative to non-infected control transgenic plants Figure S4. This suggests that CaCAP2 expression is affected by the\n                    infection, potentially due to stress-induced repression or other regulatory\n                    mechanisms. Following the confirmation of gene integration, one line was\n                    selected for further evaluation and subsequent experiments\n                        (Fig. 4 A, S3). An obvious\n                    change was observed in response to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tabaci. when comparing the wild-type\n                    and the transgenic lines (Fig. 4 B,C,D,E,F,G). We recorded a lower colony-forming unit (CFU)count\n                    of Pseudomonas , indicating reduced growth, in\n                    the leaf discs of the transgenic line than in those of the control\n                        (Fig. 4 H). Additionally, the\n                    calculation of leaf disease damage revealed less damage in the transgenic line\n                    in response to Pseudomonas infection, along\n                    with a lower MDA content, than in the wild-type (Fig. 4 I, J). There was no significant difference\n                    between the wild-type and the transgenic line in terms of electrolyte leakage\n                    from the leaves (Fig. 4 K).

( K ) Electrolyte\n                                    leakage. A comprehensive analysis of physiological parameters revealed\n                    significant differences between the wild-type and transgenic lines in response\n                    to Pseudomonas infection. Compared with those\n                    in the transgenic line, the chlorophyll a (CHL a ), chlorophyll b (CHL b ), carotenoid, and\n                    total chlorophyll contents in the wild-type were notably lower\n                        (Fig. 5 A, B, C, D). A similar\n                    trend was observed in the DPPH-radical scavenging activity, which significantly\n                    increased at a greater level in the wild-type plants than in the transgenic\n                    plants following Pseudomonas infection\n                        (Fig. 5 E). Assessing the\n                    induced oxidative response through total phenolic compound (TPC) content\n                    determination revealed a significant increase in both the wild-type and\n                    transgenic lines post-infection, with the wild-type exhibiting greater TPC\n                    content than the transgenic line (Fig. 5 F). Additionally, we studied the relative gene expression\n                    levels of selected defense-related proteins in tobacco (WT and Transgenic\n                    plants) in response to Pseudomonas infection.\n                    The heatmap shows the upregulation of thaumatin, PR-4B , and WRKY71 in CaCAP2 transgenic tobacco compared with\n                    those in healthy control tobacco. However, all the tested WRKY transcription factors were upregulated in the\n                    wild-type in response to Pseudomonas infection by spraying the bacterial suspension (Fig. 5 G). CFU is negatively correlated with\n                    chlorophyll content, the relative expression of thaumatin, and WRKY\n                    transcription factors. However, it positively correlates with DPPH%, TPC\n                    content, and the relative expression of WIN1-like and PR1-like\n                        (Fig. 5 H).

Subcellular localization of the CaCAP2 gene in leaf discs We selected the most upregulated PR-1 gene ( CAP2 ) for further\n                    evaluation. The CaCAP2-EGFP fusion protein demonstrated a distinct subcellular\n                    localization within the nucleus, extracellular and plasma membrane, as\n                    illustrated in Fig. 6 A. The\n                    fluorescence signal and localization pattern of the CaCAP2-EGFP fusion protein\n                    closely resembled those of the positive control, in which only EGFP was\n                    expressed.

Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment was executed based on biological\n                    process, molecular function, and cellular component terms for CaCAP homologs via the PANNZER2 online server\n                        (Table 1 ). The results of the\n                    GO analyses revealed a total of 11 biological processes and three cellular\n                    components. These processes primarily revolve around functions associated with\n                    reacting to stimuli and interactions within the organism's environment. They\n                    encompass responses to defensive actions, reactions to biotic stimuli,\n                    sensitivity to vitamin B1, interspecies interactions between organisms, and\n                    reactions to specific signaling molecules such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid,\n                    and ethylene, and water deprivation. Additionally, these processes involve\n                    responses to physical damage and cellular activities related to the induction of\n                    cell death (Table 1 ).

Interaction network analysis revealed that CAP proteins\n                    interact with proteins such as Hevein-like preproprotein-like, Ras-related\n                    protein RABC1-like isoform X1, Thaumatin-like protein 1-like and Threonine\n                    dehydratase biosynthetic (Table 2 ).

Promoter cloning and bioinformatic analysis of the CAP2 gene of finger lime and sweet orange Owing to the differential expression observed between finger lime\n                    and other HLB-sensitive species, such as sweet orange, we conducted a study to\n                    identify the cis-acting elements within their promoters. By analyzing these\n                    promoter regions, we aimed to elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms\n                    contributing to the observed differences in gene expression patterns between\n                    these citrus species. The promoter regions of the CAP2 gene in both finger lime (Egl122180.1) and sweet orange\n                    (Cs8g_pb004840.1) were analyzed. A 2000-bp sequence was obtained and compared\n                    with both species' CAP2 gene cDNA and\n                    upstream sequences. A total of 95.33% identity and 2.76% gaps were\n                    observed when the sequences of the two promoters were compared\n                        (Fig. 6 C, Supplementary\n                    Material 1). The analysis revealed slight variations in their linear\n                    discriminant function (LDF) scores, indicative of differences in the local\n                    concentration or distribution pattern of sequence motifs associated with\n                    transcription factor-binding sites. Finger lime sequences presented an LDF score\n                    of 0.02, whereas sweet orange sequences presented a slightly higher LDF score of\n                    0.05. Furthermore, we identified unique transcription factor-binding sites\n                    specific to each species. CAP2 promoter regulatory element analysis revealed\n                    various functional cis-acting elements, including the core cis-acting elements.\n                    Finger lime has a relatively high abundance of certain elements, such as Box 4\n                    (ATTAAT) and STRE (AGGGG), which are involved in gene expression regulation and\n                    stress response, respectively. Sweet orange, on the other hand, presents\n                    relatively high counts of elements such as the CGTCA motif and TGA element\n                    (AACGAC), which are associated with light-regulated gene expression and defense\n                    responses. Both species share common elements, such as CAAT- and MYB-binding\n                    sites, which are essential for general transcriptional regulation and stress\n                    responses. These variations in cis-acting elements suggest distinct regulatory\n                    mechanisms that may contribute to the observed differential expression patterns\n                    of the CAP2 gene between finger lime and\n                    sweet orange (Table 3 ).

Induced resistance in plants involves the\n                activation of defense mechanisms by natural compounds, such as cell wall components\n                and metabolic enzymes, providing specific protection against\n                        pathogens 33 . During pathogen attack, plants produce reactive\n                oxygen species followed by the activation of defensive machinery involving enzymatic\n                and nonenzymatic antioxidative components, secondary metabolites, and\n                pathogenesis-related proteins; phytoalexin production; cell wall modification;\n                melatonin production; carotenoid accumulation; and altered polyamine\n                        activity 34 , 35 – 36 . According to a recent categorization relying on similarities in genetic\n                sequences, PR-1 proteins, cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) found in the\n                male mammalian reproductive system and in the venom ducts of snakes and lizards, and\n                antigen (Ag) 5 proteins in insects collectively constitute the CAP superfamily of\n                proteins. This group is also referred to as the SCP protein family (sperm coating\n                glycoprotein family; Pfam: PF00188) 3 . In our recent study, specific genes sharing\n                the CAP domain were significantly upregulated in finger lime trees (HLB-tolerant\n                variety) compared with those in ‘Valencia' sweet orange (HLB-susceptible\n                variety) upon infection with Ca Las 31 . Moreover, we observed a negative\n                correlation between the titer of Ca Las and the\n                expression of CAP2 genes. Interestingly, the CAP2 gene of desert lime (HLB-resistant\n                variety) are significantly upregulated, and that upregulation is linked to desert\n                lime tolerance of HLB disease. This study highlights the potential of\n                pathogenesis-related proteins, particularly cysteine-rich secretory and\n                pathogenesis-related proteins (CAPs), in the enhancement of plant defense mechanisms\n                against pathogens and environmental stressors for sustainable agricultural\n                production. The biochemical activity and mode of action of PR-1 proteins have\n                remained elusive. However, numerous studies indicate that these proteins can bind to\n                sterols, contain a built-in defense signaling peptide, and are targeted by plant\n                pathogens when the host is infected 2 , 37 , 38 . CAP2 regulates multiple targets involved in transcription regulation,\n                RNA processing and translation initiation. Among these genes, the WRKY gene has been\n                revealed to be upregulated, thereby modulating HLB tolerance in finger lime. In\n                bananas, according to yeast one-hybrid analysis, WRKYs bind with the promoters of PR\n                genes such as MaPR1-1 , MaPR-2 , MaPR-10c , and MaCHIL1 , which revealed that the expression of these\n                genes is induced to mediate resistance against Colletotrichum musae in banana fruit 39 . WRKY70 is a key regulator of salicylic acid/jasmonic acid antagonism\n                and is also essential for the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins\n                        (PR) 40 , 41 . Hussain, et al. 42 demonstrated the\n                interaction of AtWRKY50 with the TGA2 and TGA5\n                transcription factors and the PR-1 promoter in Arabidopsis\n                    thaliana . By analyzing RNAseq data, we have validated the findings\n                obtained from in-silico protein-protein interaction analysis, which highlighted\n                significant associations of CAP with other defense-related proteins. These proteins\n                include Hevein-like preproprotein-like, Ras-related protein RABC1-like isoform X1,\n                Thaumatin-like protein 1-like, and Threonine dehydratase biosynthetic. Haven-like\n                proteins, derived from the name of the original member, the “HAVEN”\n                (Hevein Antifungal Protein). These proteins typically characterized by\n                chitin-binding domains, haven-like proteins play essential roles in plant defense\n                mechanisms against fungal pathogens by recognizing and binding to chitin and\n                contributes to broader defense responses 43 , 44 . Moreover, haven-like proteins have been served\n                as potential antimicrobial peptides 45 . Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) play a\n                crucial role in enhancing plant resistance against fungal pathogens, offering a\n                promising avenue for developing disease-resistant crop\n                        varieties 46 . Threonine dehydratase is a key player in plant\n                defense, influencing both allelopathic interactions and responses to herbivores. Its\n                role extends beyond isoleucine biosynthesis, impacting the delicate balance of plant\n                survival and growth 47 . Threonine ammonia-lyase is a key component of\n                plant defense mechanisms against herbivores and is triggered by abiotic stress.\n                Plants express a specialized isoform of this enzyme in their leaves, which has\n                unique properties aimed at deterring herbivores. While the catalytic domain remains\n                highly resistant to proteolysis; the regulatory domain degrades easily. Therefore,\n                when ingested by herbivores, the enzyme's threonine deamination function proceeds\n                unchecked, breaking down threonine before the herbivore can utilize it, ultimately\n                depriving them of this essential amino acid 48 . Ras-related protein RABC1-like plays a direct role in response to\n                stressors. Silencing of TaRab18 affected the\n                expression of defense related genes PR-1 , PR-2 and PR-5 thereby compromising the resistance of wheat to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. RxLR effector proteins from Phytophthora brassicae and P. infestans interact with host RABA-type GTPases which\n                prevents the vesicle mediated secretion of antimicrobial proteins such as PR-1 and\n                defensin (PDF1.2) likely contributing to host plant susceptibility via restriction\n                of PR-1 and PDF1.2 secretion and this was confirmed through coexpression studies in N. benthamiana 50 , 51 . Hence, CAP2-mediated abiotic stress tolerance merits further study to\n                elucidate the underlying network in response to stressors. Our findings revealed\n                elevated levels of\n                    O 2 •− in response\n                to cold and drought stress. Low levels of ROS have been found to regulate\n                differentiation, redox homeostasis, stress signaling, and systemic responses;\n                however, elevated levels of ROS harm cellular components through protein damage,\n                lipid peroxidation, and membrane destruction 52 . Thus, high levels of ROS\n                affect normal cellular functions 53 . We detected an elevated level of\n                    O 2 •− and severe\n                damage to young leaves in response to cold stress in finger lime trees. ROS\n                overproduction affects lipids and increases the lipid peroxidation of proteins and\n                DNA in plant cells 54 . Oxidative stress tolerance is an integrated\n                mechanism associated with changes in antioxidative/defensive enzymes, free radical\n                scavenging activities, nonenzymatic antioxidants, osmolytes, and signaling\n                        molecules 55 . We observed that the expression of CAP2 gene increased in response to salicylic acid application. This\n                finding aligns with the known biological function of the PR-1 gene, in which salicylic acid enhances systemic acquired\n                resistance by inducing the expression of the PR1 protein 56 . These findings suggest\n                that the identified CAP2 gene is a salicylic\n                acid-dependent regulator involved in plant defense. This study highlights the\n                importance of manipulating inherent defense mechanisms in host plants for effective\n                and sustainable plant disease management. Through the induction of resistance\n                mechanisms, plants activate various defense pathways involving a multitude of\n                factors, such as reactive oxygen species, pathogenesis-related proteins, and\n                metabolic enzymes, providing specific protection against pathogens. The expression of the finger lime CaCAP2 gene in transgenic Nicotiana\n                    tabacum induced a defense response against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tabaci. , further\n                supporting the role of CAP2 genes in plant defense mechanisms against bacterial\n                pathogens. Our study demonstrates that transgenic tobacco lines expressing CaCAP2 exhibit a distinct response to Pseudomonas infection compared to wild-type plants.\n                These transgenic plants show increased resistance, as evidenced by reduced bacterial\n                growth (lower CFU count), less leaf damage, and lower MDA content. We identified key\n                correlations between physiological parameters such as chlorophyll content, gene\n                expression levels, and antioxidant activity in both wild-type and transgenic plants.\n                These findings suggest that CaCAP2 plays a\n                crucial role in regulating oxidative stress responses and modulating defense\n                mechanisms against biotic stress. The observed changes in defense\n                strategies—such as reduced pathogen growth and a reprogrammed antioxidant\n                system—may help plants better manage oxidative damage during infection,\n                thereby enhancing stress resilience. Upon analyzing the CAP2 gene of\n                promoters, we observed variations in LDF scores between finger lime (0.02) and sweet\n                orange (0.05) concerning the local concentration and arrangement of transcription\n                factor-binding sites within the CAP2 gene\n                promoters. These differences likely influence gene expression dynamics between the\n                two citrus varieties: lower LDF scores in finger lime may indicate a denser or more\n                tightly regulated arrangement of transcription factor-binding sites, potentially\n                enhancing transcription initiation efficiency and leading to higher CAP2 gene expression levels than in sweet orange.\n                Conversely, the higher LDF score in sweet orange suggests a potentially more\n                dispersed or less accessible distribution of regulatory motifs, which could result\n                in a different regulatory landscape and consequently distinct gene expression\n                patterns. These regulatory differences are crucial, as they likely contribute to the\n                observed phenotypic variations between finger lime and sweet orange, impacting\n                traits such as fruit stress responses, and overall adaptability in different\n                environments. In summary, investigations into the CAP superfamily have demonstrated\n                their potential in enhancing plant defense mechanisms against diseases such as HLB\n                disease. Moreover, the findings elucidated the intricate regulatory network involved\n                in plant defense responses and oxidative stress tolerance, providing valuable\n                insights for the development of sustainable agricultural practices and\n                disease-resistant crop varieties. Methods Gene identification in the citrus genome The sequences of CAP proteins were retrieved from the citrus\n                    Pangenome to Breeding Database (CPBD) 57 and the National Center for\n                    Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The sequences were aligned with the sequences\n                    of citrus species. To confirm the presence of the obtained CAP proteins, we\n                    examined the presence of domain structures from the Pfam 32.0 ( http://pfam.xfam.org ) and UniProt Release 2023_05 ( https://www.uniprot.org/ ) databases. The physicochemical properties of the CAP2 protein were analyzed via the ProtParam server ( http://web.expasy.org/protparam ). The conserved motifs of the PR-1 proteins were identified via\n                    the Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) server v5.5.5 ( http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme ) (Fig. S2 ) 58 . The parameters used were as follows:\n                    max motif number to find: 10 motifs. Evolutionary relationships of the CAP\n                    proteins were determined via MEGAX 11 software, and alignments were generated\n                    via a built-in CLUSTALW implementation and the MUSCLE program. The evolutionary\n                    history was inferred via the neighbor-joining method based on the JTT\n                    matrix-based model. The protein–protein interaction network was predicted\n                    via String version 11 − 5. To validate these network\n                    predictions, we conducted gene expression analysis using qPCR on the identified\n                    genes. Gene Ontology (GO) was used to obtain information about CAP genes involvement, including biological\n                    processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, via the PANNZER2 web\n                    server ( http://plantpan2.itps.ncku.edu.tw/index.html ) 59,60 . Assessment of ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' ( Ca Las) titers in\n                        greenhouse-grown trees To assess the Ca Las titer in\n                        the leaves, genomic DNA was isolated from the petioles and midveins of fully\n                        expanded leaves. Genomic DNA extraction was performed via the GeneJET Plant\n                        Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the\n                        manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA was normalized to 25\n                        ng/µl before conducting quantitative PCR (qPCR). Quantitative PCR was\n                        carried out via a StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher\n                        Scientific). The detection of Ca Las\n                        genomic DNA was accomplished via the use of TaqMan™ Gene expression\n                        Master Mix and CQUL primers (Table S2 ), which were designed to amplify a segment of the Ca Las rplJ/rplL ribosomal\n                        protein-encoding gene 61 . Differential expression of the CAP2 gene in response to abiotic stress and salicylic acid treatment Finger lime trees (cv. UF RedLime) were grown at\n                        26 ± 1 ºC in a growth chamber or exposed to\n                        4 °C for different time intervals of 3, 7, 15 or 30 days.\n                        Leaves were collected from young and mature plants. The ‘0 h'\n                        sample represents the control finger lime trees grown at\n                        26 ± 1 ºC. Six replicates of finger lime trees\n                        were used for each time interval. Drought stress was induced by irrigating\n                        the plants with 10% PEG 8000 mw. The trees were irrigated three times\n                        per week. The samples were collected at four-time intervals, after 3, 7, 15\n                        and 30 days. To study the effects of salicylic acid exposure, the trees were\n                        sprayed with 50 mM salicylic acid mixed with 1% (v/v) Tween-20 as a\n                        surfactant as recommended by our previous study 62 . The trees were\n                        separated by plastic sheets to prevent hormonal cross-talk or contamination\n                        by adjacent foliar spraying. The samples were collected for qPCR data\n                        analysis at four-time intervals at 3, 7, 15, and 30 days post-salicylic acid\n                        spraying. At each sampling time, five biological replicates per treatment\n                        were used for physiological and biochemical measurements, and the\n                        experiments were repeated twice. Tobacco cultivation and pathogen inoculation Tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum )\n                    seeds were germinated on MS medium for 2 weeks and incubated at\n                    27 °C with a 16-hour photoperiod for 4 weeks. Leaves were\n                    transformed with the binary vector pC2300-CaCAP2-E for overexpression\n                    experiments. Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tabaci.\n                    11,528™ was cultured at 26 °C in ATCC medium with beef\n                    extract, peptone, and agar (pH 6.8). Overnight exponential-phase cultures were\n                    washed with 10 mM MgCl 2 and diluted to\n                    OD600 = 0.2. Bacterial suspensions were infiltrated into leaves\n                    using a needleless syringe, with control inoculations performed using 10 mM\n                        MgCl 2 . For assessing the CaCAP2 transgene, genomic DNA was extracted from\n                    regenerated plants using the GeneJET Plant Genomic DNA Purification Mini Kit.\n                    PCR analysis confirmed the presence of the CaCAP2 transgene using specific primers. Plants with positive\n                    PCR results were propagated, and one line was chosen for further\n                    evaluation. The bacterial population sizes were assessed to determine\n                    resistance or susceptibility by taking 0.5 cm leaf discs, incubating in\n                    10 mM MgCl 2 , and plating serial dilutions on\n                    rifampicin-supplemented nutrient medium. Colonies were counted to calculate the\n                    colony-forming unit (CFU) based on the number of colonies and the dilution\n                    factor. Physiological and biochemical analysis In situ histochemical localization of superoxide anion\n                    (O 2 •− ). Three mature leaves were collected from each tree, and five replicates\n                were sampled per treatment. In situ histochemical localization of\n                    O 2 •− was\n                performed via the NBT (Sigma‒Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA)\n                        method 63 . The leaves were vacuum infiltrated with 10 mM\n                potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 w/v% NBT as described by\n                Adam, et al. 64 . NBT-treated leaves were incubated in the dark\n                for 60 min at 25 °C and subsequently bleached in boiling\n                absolute ethanol for 30 min. Leaves were illuminated until the appearance of\n                dark blue/purple spots occurred, which are characteristic of blue formazan\n                precipitates. The leaves were subsequently stored in 50% glycerol for\n                evaluation and then photographed, and the intensity of the blue color was quantified\n                as described by Killiny, et al. 65 . The amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) was estimated according to the\n                methods of 64 . Fresh leaves were collected and extracted in\n                0.5 ml of 0.1% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The supernatant was\n                collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for\n                10 min. 2-Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) at 20% diluted in TCA was added to\n                0.5 ml of the supernatant, and the solution was incubated at\n                95 °C for 25 min. The tubes were incubated on ice for\n                10 min to stop the reaction and then evaluated for light absorption at 532\n                and 600 nm via a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The amount of MDA was calculated\n                via an extinction coefficient of\n                    155 mm − 1 cm − 1 . Loss of membrane integrity was\n                estimated by electrolyte leakage in 1 cm diameter cores as described Mur et\n                        al. 66 . These two parameters were used to indicate the\n                kinetics of cell death. To determine the differences between the infected wild-type and\n                transgenic lines, pigment contents, DPPH scavenging capacity, and total phenolic\n                compound contents were estimated. One hundred milligrams of fresh leaf sample was\n                extracted with 80% ethanol according to the method of Singleton and\n                        Rossi 67 . One hundred microliters of Folin reagent (1:10)\n                was mixed with the extract, vortexed, and incubated for 5 min at room\n                temperature. Then, the reaction was induced by adding 300 ml of 20%\n                sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) to the\n                mixture, and the tubes were incubated in the dark for 1 h. The absorbance of\n                the reaction mixture was measured at 765 nm. A standard curve was created\n                using standard solutions of gallic acid (0–600 ppm). The phenolic content is\n                expressed as milligrams of gallic acid per 100 milligrams of fresh weight\n                tissue. Subcellular localization of the finger lime gene ( CaCAP2 ) in leaf discs and overexpression of the CaCAP2 gene in tobacco The binary vector pC2300-CaCAP2-E was utilized as the basis for all\n                    the overexpression experiments, whereas the binary vector pC2300-CaCAP2-EGFP was\n                    used for the confocal studies. The pC2300-CaCAP2-E vector was developed by\n                    removing the coding sequence ( BamH I and Sac I sites at the 5′ and 3′\n                    respectively) from the plasmid DNA described by Wu et\n                            al. 68 . The new construct consists of the CaCAP2 gene (NCBI accession: PP767476) driven by a\n                    CaMV 35 S promoter. The egfp gene was\n                    driven by a CsVMV promoter, and the npt II\n                    gene was driven by the NOS promoter. The binary vector pC2300-CaCAP2-EGFP was\n                    produced by fusing the CaCAP2 gene sequence\n                    in frame to the egfp gene (NCBI accession:\n                    PP767477) to create a CaCAP2-EGFP fusion gene\n                    and subsequently cloned into the pCAM-CLON plant transformation\n                            vector 69 . The plasmid DNA was subsequently\n                    transformed into Agrobacterium strain AGL1. A\n                    single colony was selected for shaking culture for 12–16 h until\n                    the OD600 reached 0.4, and four-week-old N.\n                        benthamiana leaves were injected with a needleless syringe for\n                    transient expression. After cultivation in the growth room for 36 h, the\n                    agroinfiltrated leaf area was examined via a Leica Microsystems confocal\n                    microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). CAP2 promoter cloning and bioinformatic analysis DNA extraction from the leaves of finger lime (cv. VI697) and sweet\n                orange (cv. ‘Valencia') plants was conducted via a GeneJET Plant Genomic DNA\n                Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA) according to the\n                manufacturer's protocol. The cloned CsCAP2 and\n                    CaCAP2 cDNA sequences (chr8: Egl122180.1 ( CaCAP2 ) and Cs8g_pb004840.1 ( CsCAP2 )) were used as queries to search the C. australasica and C. sinensis genomic databases 70 , and the 5′ upstream genomic sequence\n                (approximately 2 kb) was retrieved. Specific primers for promoter isolation\n                were designed based on the reference sequences of the CaCAP2 and CsCAP2 promoters. For\n                PCR amplification, the reaction system included 25 µL of Q5 Master Mix, 2\n                µL of DNA, 2.5 µL of CAP-P-F and CAP-P-R (10 µmol/L), and 18\n                µL of ddH 2 O. The reaction procedure was as follows:\n                98 °C for 30 s; 35 cycles of 98 °C for\n                10 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for\n                20 s; and 72 °C for 10 min. The product was detected by\n                1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized in a gel documentation system.\n                The PCR products were subsequently cloned and inserted into the\n                    pCR ® 4-TOPO ® vector via TOPO TA Cloning ® (Invitrogen, Life\n                Technologies) and sequenced via the Sanger method. The recombinant vector was then\n                transformed into Escherichia coli (NEB ® 10-beta) competent cells, and the\n                positive clones selected with 50 mg/L ampicillin (Amp) were used for PCR\n                amplification and then sequenced. Three colonies from each sample were used for\n                colony sequencing. The obtained promoter sequences of CaCAP2 were compared with the sequence of the CsCAP2 gene via alignment via the SnapGene program\n                version 5.3.2 (SnapGene, San Diego, CA). All primer sequences are outlined in Table\n                S3. The regulatory elements were predicted and analyzed via the online analysis\n                server Plant CARE ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ ), TSSPlant 71 and PLACE ( https://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/ ). qPCR data analysis RNA was isolated from finely ground leaf tissues of the selected\n                    plant materials via a commercially available RNA extraction kit\n                    (Directzol™ RNA Miniprep Kit; Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). The\n                    isolated RNA samples were then subjected to qPCR analysis using the\n                    PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n                    Waltham, MA, USA). The obtained Ct values were compared to those of control\n                    plants. To determine the relative expression of the target gene, the\n                        2^ −ΔΔCT method was used,\n                    with the actin gene used as an internal housekeeping control. The primer\n                    sequences for the evaluated genes can be found in Tables S4,5,6. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was conducted via one-way analysis of variance\n                    (ANOVA) in a completely randomized design for the comparison of finger lime and\n                    ‘Valencia' trees, citrus species, drought stress and salicylic acid\n                    experiments, and transgenic tobacco experiments. Statistical analysis for cold\n                    stress was conducted via two-way ANOVA in a factorial-based complete randomized\n                    design with sampling times and young and mature leaves with five replicates. To\n                    identify significant differences between treatments, a post hoc analysis was\n                    conducted via the Tukey‒Kramer HSD test. The statistical analyses were\n                    performed via JMP Pro version 16, and significance was determined based on p\n                    values less than 0.05."
