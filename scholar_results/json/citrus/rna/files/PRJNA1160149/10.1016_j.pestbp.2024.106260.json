          "The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), is a serious sap-sucking pest on the Rutaceae plants. It is a huge threat to commercial citrus worldwide, due to its role of the principal vector of the Candidatus Liberibacter spp. (CLas) causing Huanglongbing (HLB), which is the most destructive citrus disease ( Lee et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). The citrus industry in Florida was affected by HLB and resulted in billions economic losses ( Spreen and Baldwin, 2013 ), with an annual ￥8.05–9.62 million loss in the Guangxi Province ( Jia et al., 2015 ). Management of the D. citri population is key to preventing the spread of HLB ( Li et al., 2020 ). Currently, chemical control still plays an irreplaceable role in management of D. citri because of its high efficiency ( Boina and Bloomquist, 2015 ; Ee et al., 2013 ). However, frequent application of chemicals results in insecticide resistance in D. citri , which brings great challenges to citrus production around the world ( Chen et al., 2021 ). To control D. citri effectively, it is important to develop resistance management strategies ( Barnett et al., 2019 ). Understanding the detoxification mechanism of insecticides is helpful for developing resistance management strategies.",
          "Lufenuron, a kind of benzoylurea, is an insect growth regulator insecticide, mainly against larval/nymph developmental stages, causing cuticular lesions resulting from the disruption of chitin synthesis ( Douris et al., 2016a, 2016b ; Bogwitz et al., 2005 ). Since lufenuron entered the market in 1998, it has been widely applied for management of multiple pests ( Merzendorfer, 2013 ). Due to overuse, the resistance to lufenuron in Lepidoptera ( Lv et al., 2023 ), Coleoptera ( Dos Santos Cruz et al., 2023 ), Hemiptera ( Emami, 2016 ) and Thysanoptera ( Mohamed and Ibrahim, 2022 ) has been reported. In Florida, diflubenzuron is an effective tool for D. citri management ( Tiwari et al., 2012 ). To delay the development of lufenuron resistance, it is important to study molecular mechanism of lufenuron detoxification in D. citri.",
          "UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), together with glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), are known as phase II enzymes in the detoxification process of exogenous substances in arthropods ( Bock, 2003 ). By catalyzing the conjugation of hydrophobic compounds with UDP sugars, more hydrophilic compounds are generated, thus, more readily excreted in bile or urine ( Tephly and Burchell, 1990 ; Coutinho et al., 2003 ). In contrast to human UGTs, the glycosylation of small hydrophobic compounds by arthropod UGTs has been poorly studied. Recently, some studies have shown that UGTs play an important role in the detoxification of insecticides in arthropods. UGTs can glycosylate the metabolites of phase I detoxification enzymes, while also catalyzing the reactions of electrophilic adenosinecontaining cofactors (UDPG, UDPGA, UDPX, etc. ) with insecticides ( David Josephy et al., 2005 ). Overexpression of UGTs was associated with imidacloprid detoxification in Leptinotarsa decemlineata ( Kaplanoglu et al., 2017 ), which was reported to involve in the detoxification of Nilaparvata lugens to chlorpyrifos ( Yang et al., 2023 ). A previous study demonstrated that recombinant Tetranychus urticae UGTs could glycosylate a series of pesticides ( Snoeck et al., 2019 ). TuUGT202A2 has a highly plastic and open-ended acceptor-binding site, which allows to accommodate a wide range of substrates in different orientations ( Arriaza et al., 2023 ). However, the role of UGTs to lufenuron detoxification in D. citri is still unknown.",
          "In this study, we identified an overexpression UGT gene, UGT379A1 , from transcriptome of D. citri . The expression patterns of UGT379A1 at different instars and after exposured to lufenuron was further analyzed. Molecular docking, RNA interference (RNAi), and in vitro metabolism were applied to analyze the function of UGT379A1 in D. citri . These results revealed the role of UGTs in lufenuron detoxification in D. citri ."

After half an hour, the leaf disks were placed on agar beds, and twenty D. citri 4th instar nymphs were transferred to each dish by a soft camel-hair brush. Petri dishes were wrapped with parafilm. Sealed petri dishes with D. citri were transferred into a growth chamber set at 25 ± 1 °C and 50 ± 5 % RH with a 14: 10 light: dark photoperiod. Nymphs found flaccid, dried, light colored and unable to move when probed with a camel hair brush were considered dead. The mortality of D. citri nymphs was assessed after 72 h. The 4th instar nymphs of D. citri were exposed to LC 20 and LC 50 lufenuron and cultured in the incubator. After 72 h, the surviving nymphs were collected. Three replicates were performed for each concentration."

          "Diaphorina citri is one of the most important citrus pests around the world, due to its role of the vector of HLB, which is the destructive citrus disease, causing billions of economic losses ( Gottwald, 2010 ). Insecticides are used to manage D. citri population commonly ( Chen et al., 2021 ). However, frequent application of insecticides results in development of resistance. Lufenuron belongs to benzoylurea, which affects the insect chitin synthase 1, and used to control pests field population commonly ( Douris et al., 2016a ). In previous study, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) and carboxyl/cholinesterases (CCEs) are reported to participate in lufenuron detoxification ( Panmei et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, the role of UGTs in lufenuron detoxification remains elusive. In this study, we identified a UGT gene, from the D. citri transcriptome, which was up-regulated after exposure to lufenuron.",
          "The expression pattern of a specific gene may imply its biological functions ( Kuang et al., 2022 ). The induced overexpression of detoxifying genes is thought to be involved in process of detoxification ( Demaeght et al., 2013 ). The overexpression of detoxification genes Cyp12a4 increased detoxification to lufenuron ( Bogwitz et al., 2005 ). CYP306A1 , which was involved in lufenuron detoxification, could be strongly induced by LC 10 of lufenuron in Spodoptera frugiperda ( Lu et al., 2023 ). Some up-regulated UGT genes were involved in imidacloprid detoxification in D. citri ( Tian et al., 2019 ). In current research, the expression level of UGT379A1 in D. citri was significantly increased after the exposure to lufenuron, indicating that UGT379A1 may participate in lufenuron detoxification in D. citri. The relative expression level of UGT379A1 showed a trend of increasing initaly and decreasing later, and reached the highest at the 4th instar. Consistently, lufenuron is an insect growth regulator, which exactly acts on nymphs ( Douris et al., 2016b ). Similarly, most of detoxification genes were overexpressed at larvae stage in lufenuron-resistant strain of S. frugiperda ( Do Nascimento et al., 2015 ).",
          "RNAi is extensively applied to reveal gene function in Hemiptera insects, and artificial diets is the primary methods used to deliver dsRNA ( Yang et al., 2022 ; Yu and Killiny, 2018 ). Via an RNAi-mediated approach, it has been demonstrated that the combination of RNAi and lufenuron would improve the control effect of H. armigera ( Ma et al., 2024 ). Silencing of UGT352A5 resulted in a noticeable increase in the mortality of B. tabaci ( Du et al., 2021 ). RNAi of UGT344M2 increased the toxicity of spirotetramat in A. gossypii ( Pan et al., 2020 ). Our results indicated the expression level of UGT379A1 was significantly decreased after feeding with dsUGT379A1 for 48 h or 72 h, and the mortality of D. citri after exposure to lufenuron increased significantly, which illustrates the involvement of UGT379A1 in lufenuron detoxification in D. citri .",
          "3D modeling and molecular docking are auxiliary approaches to visualize the structure of proteins, which play an important role in predicting the interaction between detoxification enzymes and insecticides ( Li et al., 2022 ; Meng et al., 2023 ). Molecular docking predicted that four UGTs could stably bind to chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos oxon, and the difference of hydrophobic interaction and binding free energy may affect the affinity of specific UGT to insecticides, thus affecting its metabolic efficiency ( Yang et al., 2023 ). In this study, the molecular docking results showed that UGT379A1 can interact with UDPG and lufenuron in different ways.",
          "In vitro metabolism is the most direct method to determine the function of detoxification genes ( Barnes et al., 1991 ). In human, megestrol acetate is converted into two secondary glucuronides by UGT2B17 after oxidized by CYP3A4 ( House et al., 2018 ). As phase II enzymes, it is involved in detoxification by glycosylation and sequestration ( Bock, 2016 ). UGT41B3 and UGT40D1 are capable of glycosylating gossypol mainly to the diglycosylated gossypol isomer 5 ( Krempl et al., 2016 ). Most of the BXD excretion in the frass occurs in the form of glucosylated products by the glycosylation of UGT33 and UGT40 in S. frugiperda ( Israni et al., 2020 ). It was found that the recombinant UGT202A9 can effectively degrade abamectin and catalyze the conjugation of UDP-glucose to abamectin in P. citri ( Shao et al., 2024 ). To clarify the role of UGT379A1 in detoxification of D. citri to lufenuron, recombinant UGT379A1 was produced by prokaryotic expression system. The specific activity of recombinant UGT379A1 was 24.04 ± 0.32 μmol/mg pro/min ( Table 2 ) and the detected protein band was consistent with the predicted position ( Fig. 4 ), which indicating that the active target protein was successfully expressed. We found that the residue of lufenuron in the UGT379A1 treatment group was significantly decreased compared with the control group, and the content of lufenuron gradually decreased with the increase of protein content. However, no metabolities were detected by HPLC-MS. In addition, the results of Dixon plot analysis indecades that it was a competitive inhibition between lufenuron and α-naphthol when combined with UDPG under the catalysis of UGT379A1. These results suggested that UGT379A1 plays an important role in lufenuron detoxification by sequestration.",
          "In conclusion, lufenuron exposure significantly increased the relative expression level of UGT379A1 in D. citri . The knockdown of UGT379A1 increased the susceptibility of D. citri to lufenuron. The recombinant UGT379A1 can deplete lufenuron by sequestration. These results indicated that UGT379A1 involved in lufenuron detoxification in D. citri , which provided a basis for the rational use of lufenuron in D. citri ."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), is a serious sap-sucking pest on the Rutaceae plants. It is a huge threat to commercial citrus worldwide, due to its role of the principal vector of the Candidatus Liberibacter spp. (CLas) causing Huanglongbing (HLB), which is the most destructive citrus disease ( Lee et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). The citrus industry in Florida was affected by HLB and resulted in billions economic losses ( Spreen and Baldwin, 2013 ), with an annual ￥8.05–9.62 million loss in the Guangxi Province ( Jia et al., 2015 ). Management of the D. citri population is key to preventing the spread of HLB ( Li et al., 2020 ). Currently, chemical control still plays an irreplaceable role in management of D. citri because of its high efficiency ( Boina and Bloomquist, 2015 ; Ee et al., 2013 ). However, frequent application of chemicals results in insecticide resistance in D. citri , which brings great challenges to citrus production around the world ( Chen et al., 2021 ). To control D. citri effectively, it is important to develop resistance management strategies ( Barnett et al., 2019 ). Understanding the detoxification mechanism of insecticides is helpful for developing resistance management strategies. Lufenuron, a kind of benzoylurea, is an insect growth regulator insecticide, mainly against larval/nymph developmental stages, causing cuticular lesions resulting from the disruption of chitin synthesis ( Douris et al., 2016a, 2016b ; Bogwitz et al., 2005 ). Since lufenuron entered the market in 1998, it has been widely applied for management of multiple pests ( Merzendorfer, 2013 ). Due to overuse, the resistance to lufenuron in Lepidoptera ( Lv et al., 2023 ), Coleoptera ( Dos Santos Cruz et al., 2023 ), Hemiptera ( Emami, 2016 ) and Thysanoptera ( Mohamed and Ibrahim, 2022 ) has been reported. In Florida, diflubenzuron is an effective tool for D. citri management ( Tiwari et al., 2012 ). To delay the development of lufenuron resistance, it is important to study molecular mechanism of lufenuron detoxification in D. citri. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), together with glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), are known as phase II enzymes in the detoxification process of exogenous substances in arthropods ( Bock, 2003 ). By catalyzing the conjugation of hydrophobic compounds with UDP sugars, more hydrophilic compounds are generated, thus, more readily excreted in bile or urine ( Tephly and Burchell, 1990 ; Coutinho et al., 2003 ). In contrast to human UGTs, the glycosylation of small hydrophobic compounds by arthropod UGTs has been poorly studied. Recently, some studies have shown that UGTs play an important role in the detoxification of insecticides in arthropods. UGTs can glycosylate the metabolites of phase I detoxification enzymes, while also catalyzing the reactions of electrophilic adenosinecontaining cofactors (UDPG, UDPGA, UDPX, etc. ) with insecticides ( David Josephy et al., 2005 ). Overexpression of UGTs was associated with imidacloprid detoxification in Leptinotarsa decemlineata ( Kaplanoglu et al., 2017 ), which was reported to involve in the detoxification of Nilaparvata lugens to chlorpyrifos ( Yang et al., 2023 ). A previous study demonstrated that recombinant Tetranychus urticae UGTs could glycosylate a series of pesticides ( Snoeck et al., 2019 ). TuUGT202A2 has a highly plastic and open-ended acceptor-binding site, which allows to accommodate a wide range of substrates in different orientations ( Arriaza et al., 2023 ). However, the role of UGTs to lufenuron detoxification in D. citri is still unknown. In this study, we identified an overexpression UGT gene, UGT379A1 , from transcriptome of D. citri . The expression patterns of UGT379A1 at different instars and after exposured to lufenuron was further analyzed. Molecular docking, RNA interference (RNAi), and in vitro metabolism were applied to analyze the function of UGT379A1 in D. citri . These results revealed the role of UGTs in lufenuron detoxification in D. citri . 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Insects The initial population of D. citri was collected from Nanning, Guangxi province, China, in 2018 then reared on Murraya exotica L. in the greenhouse. The strain was not exposed to pesticides until the present study, which was considered the susceptible strain (SS). 2.2 Insecticides and chemicals The tested insecticide lufenuron (98 %) was obtained from Shanghai Acmec Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The stock solution of lufenuron was dissolved in acetone (Analysis pure, Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China). 2.3 Bioassays and insecticide exposure The toxicities of lufenuron to D. citri nymphs were evaluated by leaf-dip method, which was modified from Tiwari ( Tiwari et al., 2011 ). For the bioassay, 3–5 mL of a 2 % agar solution was added to a 60-mm-diameter plastic disposable petri dish (Jiangsu Datang Medical Equipment Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China) to form a solidified bed. The sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis L. ) leaf discs were dipped into lufenuron or acetone (as the control treatment) for 30 s, then placed in the fume hood at room temperature for drying. After half an hour, the leaf disks were placed on agar beds, and twenty D. citri 4th instar nymphs were transferred to each dish by a soft camel-hair brush. Petri dishes were wrapped with parafilm. Sealed petri dishes with D. citri were transferred into a growth chamber set at 25 ± 1 °C and 50 ± 5 % RH with a 14: 10 light: dark photoperiod. Nymphs found flaccid, dried, light colored and unable to move when probed with a camel hair brush were considered dead. The mortality of D. citri nymphs was assessed after 72 h. The 4th instar nymphs of D. citri were exposed to LC 20 and LC 50 lufenuron and cultured in the incubator. After 72 h, the surviving nymphs were collected. Three replicates were performed for each concentration. 2.4 RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, molecular cloning, and bioinformatics analysis Total RNA was extracted from 10 D. citri adults using a Reliaprep™ RNA Tissue Miniprep System (Promega) based on the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting total RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water. The HiScript III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (+gDNA wiper) (Vazyme) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. The genomic DNA was removed first, and 8 μL of mixture containing 1 μg total RNA and RNase-free ddH 2 O was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, followed by standing on ice for 2 min. Then, 2 μL of 5 × gDNA wiper mix was added, and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. The above 10 μL mixture was added with 2 μL of 1 × RT Mix, 2 μL of HiScript II Enzyme Mix, 1 μL of Oligo (dT) 20VN, 1 μL of random hexamers, and 4 μL of RNase-free ddH 2 O. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription at 37 °C for 15 min and 85 °C for 5 s. Based on known upregulated genes from transcriptome, UGT379A1 was selected for cloning and sequencing. Based on the sequence, primers were designed to amplify the UGT379A1 (Table S1). A PCR mixture (50 μL) contained 2 μL of cDNA, 25 μL of 2 × PCR Master Mix (Genebase Bioscience, Guangzhou, China), 2 μL of forward and 2 μL of reverse primers, and 19 μL of ddH 2 O. PCR was conducted with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-rad) using the following protocol: 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, then 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 1.0 % agarose gel by electrophoresis. The target products were then excised and purified with FastPure Gel DNA Extraction Mini Kit (Vazyme). Theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point of the protein were calculated by the tools on the ExPaSy server ( http://www . expasy.ch/tools/pitool.html). The prediction of transmembrane regions and signal peptides were predicted by TMHMM 2.0 ( https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/ ) and SIGNALP 5.0 server ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ ). The amino acid sequences for multiple sequence alignment were downloaded from NCBI ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). Sequence similarity was determined by aligning with MEGA 7.0, and beautified by ESPript. 2.5 Real-time quantitative PCR Adults of D. citri were placed on Murraya exotica L. to oviposit to evaluate gene expression levels. Approximately 1000 eggs, 500 first instar nymphs, 300 s instar nymphs, 100 third instar nymphs, 70 fourth instar nymphs, 40 fifth instar nymphs, as well as 10 adult male and female were collected separately for each sample to quantify the expression of genes. Each sample had three biological replicates. Total RNA was extracted, and 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA described above. Two stable reference genes, α-tublin and β-actin were used to normalize the results. Primers for the genes and a set of two reference genes are listed in Table S2. The RT-qPCR reactions were performed on a qTOWER3G qPCR system (Analytik Jena) by the ChamQ™ Universal SYBR® qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 10-fold dilution series of pooled cDNA was used to assess the efficiency of the RT-qPCR reaction for each gene-specific primer pair. A no-template control (NTC) was also included to detect possible contamination. Experiments were performed by three biological and three technical replicates for each gene. A dissociation curve analysis was performed to check for the presence of a single amplicon. 2.6 Model construction and molecular docking The 3D model of UGT379A1 was constructed with SWISS-Model ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org ) by the crystal structure of AlphaFold DB model of A0A1S3CYB2_DIACI from D. citri (gene: LOC103507578) showing a sequence identity of 99 % with UGT379A1 as a template. The 3D stucture of UDP-galactose was obtained from pubchem ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ). Subsequently, the molecular model of lufenuron was obtained from the ZINC database ( https://zinc.docking.org/ ) and used to dock the 3D model of UGT379A1 by AutoDock Vina ( Trott and Olson, 2010 ). Finally, PyMOL 2.2.0 was used to generate structural images ( Janson et al., 2017 ). 2.7 Double-stranded RNA synthesis and RNA interference Primers (Table S3) containing T7 RNA polymerase promoter were used to amplify UGT379A1 and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene. The purified products were used as templates in a TranscriptAid T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) to synthesize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). To knock down the expression of UGT379A1 , dsRNA of UGT379A1 (dsUGT379A1) was fed to D. citri in an artificial diet ( Yuan et al., 2021 ). The final concentration was 500 ng/μL. After feeding with dsUGT379A1 in 48 h and 72 h, respectively, samples were colleted to determine the expression level of UGT379A1 . The double-stranded eGFP (dseGFP) and 20 % sucrose were used as negative controls. There were three replicates for each treatment. To determine the susceptibility of D. citri to LC 50 concentrations of lufenuron after UGT379A1 was silenced, 30 surviving D. citri nymphs of each treatment were placed to a sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis L. ) leaf disc. The bioassay method was conducted as described earlier. The dseGFP and 20 % sucrose-treated D. citri were used as negative controls. Each experiment was repeated three times. 2.8 Heterologous expression in vitro Online analysis of the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the target protein via ( https://www.detaibio.com/tools/hydropathy-analysis.html ) shows multiple hydrophobic regions in the target protein (Score > 0 is a hydrophobic region) (Fig. S1). After signal peptide prediction, it was found that there may be a signal peptide at 1–26 amino acids (Fig. S2). Hence, to ensure that no active sites and conserved regions of the protein were removed, we designed primers ( UGT379A1 ) that remove 27 amino acids from the 5′ hydrophobic region. Moreover, Sac I and BamHI restriction enzyme cutting sites were incorporated into forward and reverse primers (Table S4). Then the target gene sequences and the expression vector pCold-Sumo were ligated together after linearized with the same enzymes, respectively. The products of ligation were transformed into DH5α competent cells to identify positive clones. After that, the prokaryotic expression vectors pCold-Sumo- UGT379A1 were transformed into BL21 (DE3) strain. The grown bacterial cells were inoculated into 400 mL LB-Ampicillin media shaken at 37 °C for 6–7 h until the OD 600 reached 0.6–0.8. Then, isopropyl-β-D- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mmol/L. The culture was incubated at 16 °C overnight at 180 r/min, and collected by centrifugation. The cells were harvested at 4 °C for 5 min by centrifugation at 9000 g and resuspended with 20 mL ice-cold PBS (0.04 mol/L, pH 7.4), which added 800 μL 50× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and 80 μL 50 mg/mL lysozyme. Then the cells were disrupted by sonication (work 3 s/stop 3 s intervals, 200 W) on ice for 40 min and centrifuged at 12000 g for 50 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was purified by Ni-NTA agarose gel column (BBI, Shanghai, China), washed with 50 mmol/L imidazole (containing 0.5 mol/L NaCl, 0.04 mol/L pH 7.4 PBS) to remove impurity proteins, and eluted with 250 mmol/L imidazole (containing 0.5 mol/L NaCl, 0.04 mol/L pH 7.4 PBS). The quality of purified recombinant protein was determined by SDS-PAGE using a 5 % ( v /v) stacking gel and a 10 % (v/v) resolving gel as well as western blotting with anti-His tag monoclonal antibody. 2.9 Western blotting The purified recombinant protein was dividedusing 12 % SDS − PAGE and transferred into a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVFD) membrane (Millipore, USA) via Trans-Blot Turbo (Biorad).Subsequently, the His-tag antibodies (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) were used to incubate with the PVFD membrane at 4 °C overnight.Then 5 % defatted milk powder was used to block the PVFD membrane for 2 h at room temperature. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBST) with Tween-20 was used to wash the PVFD membrane three times. After incubation with goat antirabbit IgG (Beyotime, Shanghai,China) for 2 h at room temperature, the enhanced ECL Western blotassay kit (Biomed, Beijing, China) was used to visualize specific protein bands. 2.10 Enzyme activity and inhibition with insecticide measurements Recombinant UGT379A1 protein (purified) kinetic variables (K m [Michaelis constant] and V max [maximum velocity]) were evaluated in the enzymatic assay from a double-reciprocal plot of data obtained under assay conditions with different α-naphthol concentrations (25–200 μmol/L). To investigate the substrate competitions of the recombinant enzyme between α-naphthol and lufenuron, the median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was determined at different concentrations of lufenuron (0–100 μmol/L) with α-naphthol concentration equal to the K m of the recombinant UGT379A1 according to the enzymatic assay. For each combination of substrate and inhibitor at least three replicates were performed. In order to determine the type of inhibition, Dixon plot analysis were performed at three different concentrations of α-naphthol (50, 100 and 150 μmol/L) and five different concentrations of lufenuron (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 μmol/L). 2.11 Metabolism assays In order to identify the metabolic ability of UGT379A1 to degrade lufenuron, the reaction products were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The reaction system was modified with reference to Wang ( Wang et al., 2020 ). The purified recombinant protein (20 μg, 40 μg), 0.1 M MgCl 2 , 1000 mg/L lufenuron (Anpel-trace, Shanghai purity >99 %), 0.02 M UDPG (Yuanye, Shanghai purity >99 %) and 0.04 M PBS were used to form a 1 mL volume reaction system, and incubated at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 3 h. After the reaction was completed, 1 mL of acetonitrile was added to terminate the reaction, vortexed for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12000 g , 4 °C for 5 min. About 700 μL supernatant was filtered by 0.22 μm filter and injected into the HPLC vials. 10 μL sample was injected into the Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and detected by the chromatographic column SumFire C18 (4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm). With 80 % methanol and 20 % water as the mobile phase, at 30 °C, the flow rate of 1 mL/min, lufenuron was separated from the sample, and the absorbance change was determined at 254 nm. The inactivated protein treated at 100 °C for 30 min was used as the control for detection. 2.12 Stastistical analysis Three biological replicates were conducted for all experiments. Gene expression levels were quantified using the comparative threshold cycle (2 −ΔΔCt ) method ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2000 ). An independent sample t -test was used, and the difference between the significant level and the highly significant level was p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**), respectively. SPSS 23.0 software was used for statistical analysis. The graphics were made with GraphPad Prism 8 and Origin 2021. 3 Results 3.1 Aligning multiple sequences Based on the previously transcriptome data of D. citri (Accession: PRJNA1160149), we found that UGT379A1 (Gene ID: QBQ34573.1) up-regulated 3.15-fold, indicating that UGT379A1 may be related to the detoxification of lufenuron. The ORF sequence of UGT379A1 is 1542 bp, encoding a protein with 514 amino acids, the relative molecular weight is 59.44 kDa, and the theoretical isoelectric point is 4.77. By signal peptide analysis, it was found that there was a signal peptide at the foront of N-terminal (amino acids 1–26). By TMHMM transmembrane structure prediction, it was found that the protein had a transmembrane structure at the end of the C-terminal (amino acids 479–501), indicating that UGT379A1 was a membrane protein. Nilaparvata lugens (QCI55998.1), Bombyx mori (NP_001135960.1), Tuta absoluta (KAJ2951679.1), Xylotrechus. quadripes (QIK00366.1) and Frankliniella occidentalis (KAE8751364.1) were selected for amino acid sequence alignment ( Fig. 1 ). The protein possessed two typical domains of the UGT family: the N-terminal aglycone substrate binding domain and the C-terminal udp-glycoside binding domain. Besides, there is the UGT characteristic motif in the middle of the c-terminal domain: [FVA]-[LIVMF]-[TS]-[HQ]-[SGAC]-G-x(2)-[STG]-x(2)-[DE]-x(6)-P[LIVMFA]–[LIVMFA]-x(2)-P-[LMVFIQ]-x(2)-[DE]-Q. 3.2 Bioassays and expression patterns of UGT379A1 in different instars and under the exposure to lufenuron To clarify the expression pattern of UGT379A1 , the relative expression levels of UGT379A1 in different developmental stages of D. citri were detected by RT-qPCR. The expression levels of the UGT379A1 in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th instar and male adults were significantly up-regulated compared with eggs, which were 1.59-, 2.51-, 2.69-, 3.27-, 1.70-, 1.43-fold, respectively ( Fig. 2 A ). The expression level of UGT379A1 was significantly higher at 4th instar nymphs than any other developmental stages tested. The expression level of female adults was significantly higher than male adults. The LC 50 of lufenuron of this D. citri population was 0.15 mg/L determinated by bioassay ( Table 1 ). The relative expression levels of UGT379A1 under different concentrations of lufenuron (LC 20 and LC 50 ) were determinated by RT-qPCR ( Fig. 2 B). It was found that the relative expression level of UGT379A1 in D. citri was significantly increased by 1.69-fold (LC 20 ) and 2.97-fold (LC 50 ) under the exposure to lufenuron, indicating that UGT379A1 may be involved in the detoxification of D. citri to lufenuron. 3.3 RNAi on UGT379A1 genes increases the toxicity of lufenuron to D. citri To explore the function of UGT379A1 in lufenuron detoxification, the leaf disc delivery method was adopted to feed specific dsUGT379A1 to knock down the expression of UGT379A1 . After feeding with dsUGT379A1 for 48 h and 72 h, the expression of UGT379A1 decreased by 36.5 % (48 h) and 57.1 % (72 h), respectively, compared with dseGFP ( Fig. 2 C). After feeding with dsUGT379A1 for 24 h, the 4th instar D. citri were exposed to LC 50 of lufenuron (0.15 mg/L) for 72 h and the mortality of the D. citri increased to 64.12 % ( Fig. 2 D), which was significantly higher than dseGFP and 20 % sucrose. 3.4 Molecular docking analysis of UGT379A1 The affinity of UGT379A1 to lufenuron and UDPG was analyzed by molecular docking ( Fig. 3 ). The optimum docking results between UGT379A1 and UDPG was presented in Fig. 3 B,with a free energy ΔG of −7.8 kcal/mol. The interaction is mainly mediated by hydrogen bonds. The nitrogen atom of UDPG forms a conventional hydrogen bond with Val270 and TYR376 of UGT379A1 , and forms two hydrogen bonds with GLY276. Lufenuron was located in the pocket formed by Lys154, Asn461 and Tyr464 with a free energy ΔG of −5.4 kcal/mol. 3.5 Recombinant protein expression, kinetics, and inhibition assay in vitro of UGT379A1 Recombinant UGT379A1 was obtained by E. coli expression system. The recombinant UGT379A1 was determined by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The detected protein band was about 71 kDa (plus sumo tag) ( Fig. 4 ), which was consistent with the predicted position, indicating that the target protein was successfully expressed and purified. Using UDPG as the substrate, the specific activity of recombinant UGT379A1 was 24.04 ± 0.32 μmol/mg pro/min, and the kinetic parameters were calculated as K m = 103.2 ± 20.3 μM and V max = 61.1 ± 1.92 μmol/mg pro/min. The inhibitory effect of lufenuron on the recombinant UGT379A1 was determined. The results were as follows ( Table 2 ): when the concentration of naphthophene is 100 μM (K m ), IC 50 = 140.01 ± 10.12 μM. The results of Dixon plot analysis showed that the inhibition constant K i = 2.53 ± 0.65 μM, and the linear intersection of the three substrate concentrations was above the x-axis ( Fig. 5 ), indicating that it was a competitive inhibition. 3.6 The metabolic effect of recombinant UGT379A1 on lufenuron The metabolic effect of UGT379A1 on lufenuron was determined by HPLC ( Fig. 6 ). When the elution time was about 9 min, lufenuron was detected. The results showed that the lufenuron contentn of the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control group, and the lufenuron content decreased by 18.77 % ± 3.44 % and 33.91 % ± 2.46 % for 20 and 40 μg recombinant UGT379A1, respectively. According to the results of mass spectrometry, no new peak was detected after the reaction of the recombinant UGT379A1 with lufenuron. 4 Discussion Diaphorina citri is one of the most important citrus pests around the world, due to its role of the vector of HLB, which is the destructive citrus disease, causing billions of economic losses ( Gottwald, 2010 ). Insecticides are used to manage D. citri population commonly ( Chen et al., 2021 ). However, frequent application of insecticides results in development of resistance. Lufenuron belongs to benzoylurea, which affects the insect chitin synthase 1, and used to control pests field population commonly ( Douris et al., 2016a ). In previous study, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) and carboxyl/cholinesterases (CCEs) are reported to participate in lufenuron detoxification ( Panmei et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, the role of UGTs in lufenuron detoxification remains elusive. In this study, we identified a UGT gene, from the D. citri transcriptome, which was up-regulated after exposure to lufenuron. The expression pattern of a specific gene may imply its biological functions ( Kuang et al., 2022 ). The induced overexpression of detoxifying genes is thought to be involved in process of detoxification ( Demaeght et al., 2013 ). The overexpression of detoxification genes Cyp12a4 increased detoxification to lufenuron ( Bogwitz et al., 2005 ). CYP306A1 , which was involved in lufenuron detoxification, could be strongly induced by LC 10 of lufenuron in Spodoptera frugiperda ( Lu et al., 2023 ). Some up-regulated UGT genes were involved in imidacloprid detoxification in D. citri ( Tian et al., 2019 ). In current research, the expression level of UGT379A1 in D. citri was significantly increased after the exposure to lufenuron, indicating that UGT379A1 may participate in lufenuron detoxification in D. citri. The relative expression level of UGT379A1 showed a trend of increasing initaly and decreasing later, and reached the highest at the 4th instar. Consistently, lufenuron is an insect growth regulator, which exactly acts on nymphs ( Douris et al., 2016b ). Similarly, most of detoxification genes were overexpressed at larvae stage in lufenuron-resistant strain of S. frugiperda ( Do Nascimento et al., 2015 ). RNAi is extensively applied to reveal gene function in Hemiptera insects, and artificial diets is the primary methods used to deliver dsRNA ( Yang et al., 2022 ; Yu and Killiny, 2018 ). Via an RNAi-mediated approach, it has been demonstrated that the combination of RNAi and lufenuron would improve the control effect of H. armigera ( Ma et al., 2024 ). Silencing of UGT352A5 resulted in a noticeable increase in the mortality of B. tabaci ( Du et al., 2021 ). RNAi of UGT344M2 increased the toxicity of spirotetramat in A. gossypii ( Pan et al., 2020 ). Our results indicated the expression level of UGT379A1 was significantly decreased after feeding with dsUGT379A1 for 48 h or 72 h, and the mortality of D. citri after exposure to lufenuron increased significantly, which illustrates the involvement of UGT379A1 in lufenuron detoxification in D. citri . 3D modeling and molecular docking are auxiliary approaches to visualize the structure of proteins, which play an important role in predicting the interaction between detoxification enzymes and insecticides ( Li et al., 2022 ; Meng et al., 2023 ). Molecular docking predicted that four UGTs could stably bind to chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos oxon, and the difference of hydrophobic interaction and binding free energy may affect the affinity of specific UGT to insecticides, thus affecting its metabolic efficiency ( Yang et al., 2023 ). In this study, the molecular docking results showed that UGT379A1 can interact with UDPG and lufenuron in different ways. In vitro metabolism is the most direct method to determine the function of detoxification genes ( Barnes et al., 1991 ). In human, megestrol acetate is converted into two secondary glucuronides by UGT2B17 after oxidized by CYP3A4 ( House et al., 2018 ). As phase II enzymes, it is involved in detoxification by glycosylation and sequestration ( Bock, 2016 ). UGT41B3 and UGT40D1 are capable of glycosylating gossypol mainly to the diglycosylated gossypol isomer 5 ( Krempl et al., 2016 ). Most of the BXD excretion in the frass occurs in the form of glucosylated products by the glycosylation of UGT33 and UGT40 in S. frugiperda ( Israni et al., 2020 ). It was found that the recombinant UGT202A9 can effectively degrade abamectin and catalyze the conjugation of UDP-glucose to abamectin in P. citri ( Shao et al., 2024 ). To clarify the role of UGT379A1 in detoxification of D. citri to lufenuron, recombinant UGT379A1 was produced by prokaryotic expression system. The specific activity of recombinant UGT379A1 was 24.04 ± 0.32 μmol/mg pro/min ( Table 2 ) and the detected protein band was consistent with the predicted position ( Fig. 4 ), which indicating that the active target protein was successfully expressed. We found that the residue of lufenuron in the UGT379A1 treatment group was significantly decreased compared with the control group, and the content of lufenuron gradually decreased with the increase of protein content. However, no metabolities were detected by HPLC-MS. In addition, the results of Dixon plot analysis indecades that it was a competitive inhibition between lufenuron and α-naphthol when combined with UDPG under the catalysis of UGT379A1. These results suggested that UGT379A1 plays an important role in lufenuron detoxification by sequestration. In conclusion, lufenuron exposure significantly increased the relative expression level of UGT379A1 in D. citri . The knockdown of UGT379A1 increased the susceptibility of D. citri to lufenuron. The recombinant UGT379A1 can deplete lufenuron by sequestration. These results indicated that UGT379A1 involved in lufenuron detoxification in D. citri , which provided a basis for the rational use of lufenuron in D. citri .
