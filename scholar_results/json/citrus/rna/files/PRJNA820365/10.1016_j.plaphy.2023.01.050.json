    "full_text": "As a well-recognized traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), immature fruits of Citrus grandis ‘Tomentosa’ (CGT) serve to cure chronic cough in humans. Specialized metabolites including flavonoids may have contribute to this curing effect. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying flavonoid biosynthesis in ‘Tomentosa’ fruits will, therefore, support the breeding of varieties with improved medicinal properties. Hence, we profiled the transcriptomes and metabolites of the fruits of two contrasting C. grandis varieties, namely ‘Zheng-Mao’ (‘ZM’) used in TCM production, and a locally cultivated pomelo, namely ‘Guang-Qing’ (‘GQ’), at four developmental stages. A total of 39 flavonoids, including 14 flavanone/flavone, 5 isoflavonoids, 12 flavonols, and 6 anthocyanins, were identified, and 16 of which were quantitatively determined in the fruits of the two varieties. We found that ‘ZM’ fruits contain more flavonoids than ‘GQ’. Specifically, rhoifolin levels were significantly higher in ‘ZM’ than in ‘GQ’. We annotated 31,510 genes, including 1,387 previously unknown ones, via transcriptome sequencing of ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ.’ A total of 646 genes were found to be differentially expressed between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ throughout at all four fruit developmental stages, indicating that they are robust expression markers for future breeding programs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 18 modules. Combined transcriptional and metabolic analysis revealed 25 genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and 16 transcriptional regulators (MYBs, bHLHs, WD40) that may be involved in the flavonoids biosynthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits."

          "Citrus grandis ‘Tomentosa’ of the genus Citrus is an ancient variety of C. grandis (L.) Osbeck (pomelo). Unlike freshly consumed pomelo, immature ‘Tomentosa’ fruits are processed and utilized as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), called ‘Huajuhong’ in Chinese, which is famous for resolving phlegm, suppressing cough and calming panting. C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ originated from the Huazhou area located in the Guangzhou Province of southern China, and received a China Geographical Indication (GI) protection status ( Li et al., 2014 ). ‘Tomentosa’ fruits contain considerable amounts of flavonoids possessing various pharmaceutical properties such as antioxidant, antigenotoxic ( Bacanli et al., 2015 ), anti-hyperlipidemic ( Xu et al., 2012 ), and neuroprotective ( Gopinath and Sudhandiran, 2016 ) activities. Naringin, as one of the main chemical components in ‘Huajuhong’, may have potential to treat pulmonary diseases ( Luo et al., 2013 ). Due to long-term sexual propagation, multiple varieties of C. grandis are currently used for the production of ‘Huajuhong’. In a previous study, we evaluated and compared major bioactive chemical components and their antioxidant activities in the fruits of six C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ varieties ( Fan et al., 2019 ). Among the different varieties, ‘ZhengMao’ (‘ZM’) fruits are covered with a thick layer of trichomes, while the surface of ‘GuangQing’ (‘GQ’) fruits is smooth because of the absence of trichomes. The medicinal effect of ‘ZM’ is significantly better than that of ‘GQ’ and the fruits of ‘ZM’ are, therefore, best used as a raw material for ‘Huajuhong’ production. Although we had evaluated the contents of naringin and rhoifolin ( Fan et al., 2019 ), changes in their levels during fruit development have not yet been analyzed. In addition, an analysis of the wider spectrum of flavonoids accumulating in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits will be beneficial for establishing a solid basis for the high medicinal quality of ‘ZM.’ Moreover, research on flavonoid biosynthesis pathways and underlying genes is important for breeding and biotechnological improvement of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ germplasm. Importantly, the knowledge gained from this research can be used for the synthesis of important metabolites in microbial systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae using synthetic biology. This will provide a sustainable raw material for the future production of TCM.",
          "The flavonoid synthesis pathway, an important class of secondary metabolites in plants, has been comprehensively investigated ( Shen et al., 2022 ). Enzymes encoded by structural genes like PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE ( PAL ), CINNAMATE 4-HYDROXYLASE ( C4H ), 4 -COUMARATE-COA LIGASE (4CL), CHALCONE SYNTHASE ( CHS ), and CHALCONE ISOMERASE ( CHI ) are responsible for the generation of naringenin which is the primary precursor of specific flavonoids in the citrus family ( Chen et al., 2021 ). The conserved MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) ternary complex plays an important role in regulating the expression of the structural genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway ( Jaakola, 2013 ; Xu et al., 2015 ). Most of the studies have been conducted in model plants and often with respect to the production of flavonoid-based pigments. In Citrus sinensis , the bHLH transcription factor (TF) CsMYC2 was found to be potentially involved in the regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis ( Cultrone et al., 2009 ). Additionally, the R2R3-MYB TF Ruby activates anthocyanin accumulation in blood citrus fruits ( Butelli et al., 2012 ). Subsequently, CsMYB3 was discovered as a transcriptional repressor to form an ‘activation and repression’ loop with CsRuby1 for the stable accumulation of anthocyanins in C. sinensis ( Huang et al., 2020 ). In purple pomelo, another MYB TF, CgRuby2, acts as a repressor by competitively binding to CgbHLH1, like CgRuby1 ( Huang et al., 2018 ).",
          "Due to long juvenile phase and a high degree of heterozygosity in Citrus ( Cultrone et al., 2009 ), performing classical genetic studies to elucidate the molecular basis of flavonoid biosynthesis remains difficult. With the reduced costs of generating omics datasets and the availability of multiple bioinformatics tools, integrated omics approaches have become increasingly popular in plant research ( Wang et al., 2022 ; Wu et al., 2021 ). Omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics can reveal the spatial and/or temporal dynamics of a biological system, and by integrating multi-omics datasets a holistic view of the system analyzed can be obtained ( Jiang et al., 2022 ; Riano-Pachon et al., 2009 ). In this way, biologists can discover pathways for the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites ( Rai et al., 2017 ) and identify their regulators.",
          "Here, we systematically investigated the ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ varieties by a combined analysis of their transcriptomes and metabolomes to reveal the flavonoids and genes supporting the medicinal quality of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits. To this end, we performed an untargeted metabolic analysis of immature ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits at different developmental stages (2–8 cm in diameter), followed by targeted verification and quantitation of flavonoids. We also profiled the transcriptomes of those fruits by RNA-seq, and determined differentially accumulated metabolites and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and correlations between them. Finally, we revealed 25 enzyme-encoding genes of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in ‘Tomentosa’ fruits and genes of 16 transcription-related proteins (including MYBs, bHLHs, and WD40-repeat proteins) as potential candidates for the regulation of flavonoid synthesis."

The mixture was vortex-shacked for 30 s, and ultrasonication was conducted for 15 min at 25 °C. Second, extraction of the metabolites was performed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm (microcentrifuge). Finally, 300 μL supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Tianjin JinTeng Instrument Company, Tianjin, China) to obtain samples for LC-MS. To monitor deviations caused by the analytical instrument itself, a quality control (QC) sample was also analyzed by mixing 20 μL of each individual sample. The LC-MS analysis was conducted based on our previous protocol ( Fan et al., 2020 ) with some modifications, and six replicates of each sample were analyzed. After conversion of the LC-MS data to mzXML format files, XCMS ( www.bioconductor.org ) was used for the identification, filtration, and alignment of peaks. The exact molecular weight was used to confirm each metabolite, and possible empirical formulae of the metabolites were speculated (molecular weight error <20 ppm). For multivariate statistical analysis, the XCMS output was further processed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft), and the normalized data were imported into Simca-P software (version 11.0; Umetrics AB, www.umetrics.com/simca ). All data were mean-centered and unit variance (UV)-scaled before applying PCA and PLS–DA to guard against overfitting. A default 7-fold (leave-1/7th samples-out) cross-validation procedure and 100-random permutation testing were carried out to ensure that the supervised PLS-DA models do not overfit. These discriminating metabolites were obtained using a statistically significant threshold for variable influence on projection (VIP > 1.0). Values were obtained from the PLS–DA model and further validated via Student's t-test (p < 0.05). Metabolites with VIP values above 1.0 and p values below 0.05 were selected as discriminating metabolites between the two classes of samples. Multivariate data analyses including PCA, PLS-DA, and orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) were conducted using the R (version 3.3.2) package ropls with methods described previously ( Thévenot et al., 2015 ). The ropls package is available from the Bioconductor repository ( Gentleman et al., 2004 ). Differentiated metabolites between two classes of samples were identified using a statistically significant threshold of VIP ≥ 1 and further validated by one-way univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p ≤ 0.05). To investigate the metabolic pathways, the identified metabolites were aligned to biochemical pathways provided by KEGG ( http://www.kegg.jp/pathway).To investigate metabolic pathways, the identified metabolites were aligned to biochemical pathways provided by KEGG ( http://www.kegg.jp/pathway )."

The RNA-seq was performed by Gene Denovo Biotechnology (Guangzhou, China), using a protocol described previously ( Wang et al., 2020a ), with minor modifications. RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and checked using RNase-free agarose gel electrophoresis. Then the enriched mRNA was fragmented into short fragments using fragmentation buffer and reverse-transcribed into cDNA by using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #7530; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The purified double-stranded cDNA fragments were end-repaired, A base added, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation reaction was purified with the AMPure XP Beads (1.0X). Ligated fragments were subjected to size selection by agarose gel electrophoresis and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resulting cDNA library was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument. Bioinformatics analysis including filtering of raw reads, alignment with the pomelo reference genome ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/index.php , Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck. cv. ‘Wanbaiyou’ v1.0), the quantification of gene abundance, and the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were carried out by Gene Denovo Biotechnology. Briefly, after filtering of raw reads, an index of the reference genome was built, and paired-end clean reads were mapped to the abovementioned pomelo reference genome using HISAT (version 2.2.4) ( Kim et al., 2015 ) and other parameters set as a default. The repeatability of the data was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) performed by R ( Shen et al., 2014 ).

Fig. S1 illustrates the total ion chromatographs of all the samples in the positive and negative modes, respectively. Quality control (QC) was conducted to ensure the reliability of the methodology and data. As shown in Figs. S2A and B , principal component analysis (PCA) revealed densely gathered data patterns in both positive and negative modes indicating reliability of the data ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 ). In order to discover biomarkers, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of potential characteristic peaks in QC samples should not exceed 30%, otherwise the relevant characteristic peaks should be deleted ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 ) which is the quality assurance. In Fig. S1B , the proportion of characteristic peaks with RSD < 30% is higher than 70% in positive mode which further validates the reliability of the obtained data ( Want et al., 2010 ). The results of PCA as shown in Fig. S3 indicated that there were general differences in the total metabolites between the ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ groups and that the degree of variation between samples within the group was small. Notably, the variation between the groups of ‘ZM-6’ and ‘ZM-8’ was also small as well as the variation between ‘GQ-6’ and ‘GQ-8’. A total of 25,005 and 22,434 precursor molecules were obtained in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, 407 compounds were identified and detailed information including retention time (rt), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), exact mass, formula, KEGG ID, and the accurate molecular weight of metabolite errors (ppm) is provided in Table S1 .",

The total intensity of each category was calculated to determine the contents of flavonoids in each sample. In order to further elucidate the chemical composition of the bioactive flavonoids, a targeted metabolic analysis was performed. The qualitative contents of 16 flavonoids, namely, naringin, rhoifolin, prunin, naringenin, isovitexin, rutin, vitexin, glycitin, cynaroside, diosmin, apigenin, isoquercetin, catechin, daidzin, luteolin and taxifolin were determined ( Fig. 1 B). Naringin, rhoifolin, prunin and naringenin are the top four flavonoids present in high levels in the fruits of Citrus grandis ‘Tomentosa’, in the mg/g range. The contents of naringin are extremely high, however, there is insignificant difference between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’, while the content of rhoifolin is significantly higher in ‘ZM’ than in ‘GQ’ at all four fruit developmental stages. The amounts of naringenin in ‘ZM’ fruits at S1 and S2 are higher than in ‘GQ’ ( p < 0.05). In addition, there are significant differences in the contents of rutin ( p < 0.01), isovitexin ( p < 0.05), vitexin ( p < 0.05), glycitin ( p < 0.05), and daidzin ( p < 0.01) between S1 fruits of ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’.

The greatest number of DEGs was identified when comparing ZM-2 vs. ZM-4 (3,522 genes; 1,857 up, 1,665 down), followed by the comparison of GQ-2 vs. GQ-4 (3,431 genes; 1,843 up, 1,588 down), indicating major developmental shifts between these two fruit stages in both varieties. Many genes were also differentially expressed when identical fruit stages of different cultivars where compared; the largest difference was observed in the comparison ZM-4 vs . GQ-4 (2,724 genes). Furthermore, Venn analysis revealed 646 genes that were differently expressed between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ throughout all four developmental fruit stages ( Fig. 2 C and Table S6 ). GO classification analysis revealed that many genes related to ‘biological process’, ‘cellular component’, and ‘molecular function’ were included in the DEGs ( Fig. S6A ). The most significantly enriched biological process was observed in ‘response to external stimulus’ (GO:0009605), cellular process was ‘ribonucleoprotein granule’ (GO:0035770), and molecular function was ‘chromatin binding’ (GO:0003682) ( Fig. S6 BCD and Table S7 ). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed 65 enriched metabolic pathways ( Table S8 ), with ‘glutathione metabolism’ showing the strongest enrichment ( Fig. S7 ).",
              "TFs are crucial cellular regulators of essentially all developmental and physiological processes, and they likely also contribute to the pharmacological differences between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits. Therefore, we analyzed our transcriptome data to identify TFs differentially expressed between the two varieties at the four developmental fruit stages. A total of 109, 169, 106, and 108 TFs, respectively, were differentially expressed between the groups ZM-2 vs . GQ-2, ZM-4 vs . GQ-4, ZM-6 vs . GQ-6, and ZM-8 vs . GQ-8. Expression levels and statistical data of the TFs are presented in Table S9 . Considering the crucial role of MYB and bHLH TFs for controlling flavonoid biosynthesis, genes encoding them were further examined. Interestingly, two C. grandis MYB genes, i.e., Cg4g016300 and Cg5g039960 , were significantly differentially expressed between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ at all fruit developmental stages, suggesting they might be related to the differential accumulation of flavonoids in the fruits of the two cultivars. To further narrow down genes and TFs controlling flavonoid biosynthesis we conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) for the transcriptome data. First, genes with extremely low expression levels in all samples were removed to ensure accuracy of the network building (for details, see Materials and methods). A gene clustering tree was then constructed, considering the correlations between gene expression levels. Gene modules were established based on clustering relationships, i.e., genes with similar expression patterns were classified into the same module. The modules were generated by cutting off branches from the dendrogram. Dynamic Tree Cut is the primary classification method used to define modules ( Langfelder et al., 2008 ). Finally, similar modules were merged, and 18 modules were obtained, as shown in Fig. 3 A, where each color, i.e., brown, blue etc., represents a module, and gray represents genes that could not be classified into any module. The number of genes and TFs in each module is shown in Fig. S8 . Paleturquoise, thistle3, and darkmagenta are the top three modules including the highest number of genes, i.e., 4,064, 2,313, and 1,885, respectively, while the numbers of TFs in modules paleturquoise (234), darkmagenta (179), and brown (151) were above hundred. In Fig. 3 B, the three largest modules (paleturquoise, darkmagenta, and brown) were distributed in different subunits, reflecting of different expression patterns of the genes in those modules. Some modules showed strong correlations, such as the blue and brown2 modules ( Fig. 3 B), as the genes in these modules exhibit similar expression patterns during the various developmental stages of the two varieties. The WGCNA result provides important information about modules of highly correlated genes which can be integrated with metabolomic data for the identification of relevant gene clusters."

              "To understand flavonoid synthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits, the metabolite and transcriptional data were investigated together. To this end, the correlation between the WGCNA modules and the contents of 16 flavonoids was analyzed. Fig. 3 B shows the of correlation coefficients and corresponding p values. According to the correlation values, the paleturquoise module is significantly ( p < 0.001) positively correlated with catechin (r = 0.81), vitexin (r = 0.64), and isovitexin (r = 0.62). The darkmagenta module showed significant ( p < 0.001) positive correlations with naringenin (r = 0.79), prunin (r = 0.77), and isoquercetin (r = 0.69). The highest correlation value was observed for mediumorchid and isovitexin content (r = 0.88, p = 2e-08). For naringin and rhoifolin, lightcyan and blue are the two most correlated modules, respectively. In other words, the genes in these modules might be involved in the process of the flavonoid metabolism. Furthermore, hub genes in these modules were analyzed based on the intramodular connectivity. The selected hub genes as shown in Table S10 could be important regulators for the biosynthesis of flavonoids. A total of 845 hub genes were selected according to the intensity of connectivity ranking in top 10% ( Table S10 ). The annotation of KEGG pathways and GO terms for those hub genes were also presented in Table S10 to further classify the hub genes. Notably, the most significantly enriched molecular function was ‘UDP-glucosyltransferase activity’ (GO:0035251) ( Fig. S9 ), as reported previously, glycosylation catalyzed by glycosyltransferases plays an important role in regulating the stability, availability, and biological activity of flavonoids ( Dong et al., 2020 ). The pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis, beginning with phenylalanine, is illustrated in Fig. 4 , which includes the results of the metabolite profiling. The expression of the main structural genes in ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ throughout fruit development is shown in heatmaps ( Fig. 4 ), next to the pathway. The FPKM value of each structural gene and the respective WGCNA module to which it belongs to are Table S11 . The pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis (isoflavonoid, flavanone and flavone, flavonol and anthocyanin) are illustrated in different colors, and a summary of the metabolite ion intensity of each pathway is shown in the heatmaps ( Fig. 4 ). The total intensity data of flavonoids are listed in Table S3 . As can be seen, the contents of flavonoids derived from the isoflavonoid, and flavanone and flavone pathways are higher in ‘ZM’ than in ‘GQ’ fruits, while the total metabolite ion intensity from the flavonol and anthocyanin pathways is stronger in ‘GQ’ fruits. As shown in Fig. 4 , the expression levels of CgCHS in all samples were extremely high compared with other structural genes such as CgPAL1 , Cg4CL1 and CgCHI . In the backbone pathway ( Fig. 4 ), expression levels of CgPAL1 , CgPAL2 , CgPAL3 , CgPAL4 , CgPAL5 , CgC4H , and Cg4CL1 were highest in the Stage 4 of the fruits (8 cm) for the two varieties ( Table S11 ). Considering the lowest contents of the flavonoids from the backbone pathway, those genes might be also involved in other biological process. However, the relative higher expression levels of Cg4CL2 , Cg4CL3 , CgCHS , and CgCHI in smaller fruits suggests these genes were important for the biosynthesis of naringenin, which is the precursor for the diversified synthesis of flavonoids. Cg1, 2RhaT (1,2-rhamnosyltransferase) which is a key enzymatic gene for the biosynthesis of naringin ( Frydman et al., 2004 ) shows different expression patterns in ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits, as well as CgFNS (flavone synthase) which is essential for the biosynthesis of rhoifolin. Hence, those two genes might play important role for the produce of naringin and rhoifolin. In summary, the flavonoid biosynthesis is influenced through transcriptional levels of some structural genes. As shown in Table S11 , structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis mainly belong to the paleturquoise and darkmagenta modules. The predicted cis -elements of these structural genes are presented in Fig. S10 and Table S12 . MYB and MYC binding sites were observed in all structural genes. Considering this, we focused our further analysis on TFs of the MYB and bHLH families, as well as on WD40-repeat proteins, which form a complex with these two types of TFs to regulate flavonoid biosynthesis ( Table S13 ). Twenty-eight MYB , nine bHLH , and one WD40 genes were present in the paleturquoise module, while16 MYB, 12 bHLH , and 1 WD40 genes are included in the darkmagenta module. We selected 21 MYB, 12 bHLH , and 1 WD40 genes, considering their expression levels and connectivity, to illustrate their transcriptional regulatory network for flavonoid biosynthesis in the paleturquoise and darkmagenta modules ( Fig. 5 ). The gene IDs and names of the TFs are listed in Table S14 .",
              "Next, we searched for potential correlation of the 16 selected flavonoids with the DEGs between the 16 selected flavonoids in the groups ZM-2 vs . GQ-2, ZM-4 vs . GQ-4, ZM-6 vs . GQ-6, and ZM-8 vs . GQ-8. The correlation and p values of the main structural genes and selected MYB , bHLH and WD40 family genes with relatively high expression levels are shown in Table S15 . Pearson correlation coefficients between the four sets of groups compared were further examined to identify genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. On comparing ZM-2 vs . GQ-2, five MYB members ( CgMYB4 , CgMYB15, CgMYB74 , CgMYB103 , and CgMYB167 ) were sorted out. Among them, the expression level of CgMYB103 was positively correlated with naringenin content with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.83, whereas CgMYB4 and naringenin content were negatively correlated (r = −0.95). CgMYB74 (r = 0.95) and CgMYB167 (r = 0.96) were significantly positively correlated with rutin content, whereas CgMYB4 and rutin content were negatively correlated (r = −0.91).",
              "For comparing ZM-4 vs . GQ-4, seven MYB and three bHLH genes ( CgMYB4 , CgMYB59 , CgMYB74 , CgMYB77 , CgMYB88 , CgMYB108 , CgMYB111.1 , CgbHLH92 , CgbHLH140 , CgbHLH162.4 ) were selected. Among them, two MYBs ( CgMYB74 and CgMYB108 ) and one bHLH ( CgbHLH162.4 ) were highly positively correlated with naringenin content, with a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.90. Expression of CgMYB74 was also positively correlated with the levels of luteolin (r = 0.92), taxifolin (r = 0.94), and glycitin (r = 0.94) levels. Notably, CgMYB4 expression was negatively correlated with almost all flavonoid content except catechin (r = 0.83) and prunin (r = 0.94) contents. The expression levels of CgMYB111.1 and CgbHLH140 was comparable to that of CgMYB4 . Since prunin is the precursor metabolite of flavanones and flavones, we inferred that CgMYB4, CgMYB111.1 and CgbHLH140 repress the production of flavonoids in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits. Other TFs including CgMYB59, CgMYB74, CgMYB108, CgMYB77, CgMYB88, CgbHLH92, and CgbHLH162.4 activate the biosynthesis of flavonoids.",
              "In the group of ZM-6 vs. GQ-6, the expression levels of three MYBs ( CgMYB15 , CgMYB46 and CgMYB77 ) and one WD40 ( Cg1g012600 ) were significantly positively correlated with the content of rhoifolin content (r > 0.90, p < 0.05). In the group of ZM-8 vs. GQ-8, a WD40 member ( Cg2g017030 ) was highly (r < −0.95, p < 0.01) negatively correlated with the contents of diosmin and rhoifolin which are derived from the flavanone and flavone biosynthesis pathway. In summary, nine MYB ( CgMYB15, CgMYB46 , CgMYB59 , CgMYB74 , CgMYB77 , CgMYB88 , CgMYB103 , CgMYB108 , CgMYB167 ), two bHLH ( CgbHLH162.4 and CgbHLH92 ), and one WD ( Cg1g012600 ) genes were identified as candidate activators, and two MYB ( CgMYB4 and CgMYB111.1 ), one bHLH ( CgbHLH140 ) and one WD ( Cg2g017030 ) genes were identified as promising repressors for the biosynthesis of flavonoids in the fruits of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’."

          "Flavonoids were proved to have potential to reduce mortality through a diet rich in plant-derived foods ( Bondonno et al., 2019 ). As a recognized Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with China Geographical Indication GI) protection ( Li et al., 2014 ), the chemical, and potentially pharmacologically active components, particularly the flavonoids, of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits have attracted much attention. In the present study, the contents of four flavonoids (naringin, rhoifolin, prunin and naringenin) are relatively high (in grade of mg/g dry mass), especially naringin which in some studies appeared to be effective against chronic cough ( Luo et al., 2013 ) and to provide lung protection ( Chen et al., 2013 ). The second highest is rhoifolin, and preclinical studies have shown that it possesses a variety of significant biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and anticancer effects ( Refaat et al., 2015 ). The monoglycoside flavonoid prunin also shows biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, anticancer, antiviral and neuroprotective activities ( Carceller et al., 2019 ). In addition, the bioavailability and cardioprotective action of naringenin have been examined by some clinical studies ( Salehi et al., 2019 ). In our previous study, we compared naringin and rhoifolin in three tissues (exocarp, mesocarp, and pulp) of six varieties of C. grandis fruits and observed significant differences in the contents of naringin and rhoifolin between the tissues analyzed ( Fan et al., 2019 ). Duan et al. identified ten flavonoids from the fruits, leaves, branches, and flowers of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ ( Duan et al., 2014 ). Different from the freshly consumed pomelo, fruits of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ are utilized for the production of the Chinese medicine ‘Huajuhong’. However, some profiteers used locally produced pomelo as raw material to produce fake ‘Huajuhong’ which has a dramatically lower medicinal effect than the genuine product; for a typical customer it is virtually impossible to distinguish between the two products. Therefore, it is important to develop solid quality standards in the production of ‘Huajuhong’ that can be controlled by health authorities. The unique chemical composition of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits can be helpful in this respect. In addition, integrated metabolic and transcriptome analyses can provide clues for the mining of key regulatory genes that are important for both the breeding of new plant cultivars and the production of interesting metabolites in microbial systems using synthetic biological approaches.",
          "C. grandis ‘ZM’ is a typical variety for the production of ‘Huajuhong’, and ‘GQ’ is the locally cultivated pomelo. A total of 39 flavonoids including 14 flavanones/flavones, five isoflavonoids, 12 flavonols, six anthocyanins were identified, and 16 of them were further quantitatively measured in ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ varieties. While naringin content was similar in the two varieties, ‘ZM’ contained more rhoifolin than that in ‘GQ’ throughout fruit development, indicating it might be an important specialized flavonoid in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. In addition, eight flavonoids (isovitexin, vitexin, glycitin, cynaroside, diosmin, daidzin, luteolin and taxifolin) were detected and identified for the first time in ‘Tomentosa’ fruits. ‘Huajuhong’ is produced from fruits of 6–8 cm in diameter. Our finding that the contents of rhoifolin, isovitexin, rutin, vitexin, diosmin, apigenin, isoquercetin, and catechin are significantly different between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ might, therefore, be of medical relevance for contributing to the pharmacological properties of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. These flavonoids may potentially be utilized as biomarkers to distinguish bona fide ‘Huajuhong’ from fake products. Isoflavonoids are predominantly abundant in Papilionoideae, a subfamily of the Leguminosae ( Dixon and Sumner, 2003 ). However, isoflavonoids have also been identified in non-leguminous plant families, including Iridaceae, Moraceae, Liliaceae, Compositae, and Meliaceae ( Al-Maharik, 2019 ). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of isoflavonoids (glycitin and daidzin) in a species of the Rutaceae.",
          "In citrus fruits, as in other plants, flavonoids are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway which involves three main phases: precursor ( p -coumaroyl-CoA) synthesis; the synthesis of flavanones, flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins; and finally the formation of various glycosides through glycosylation. Enzymes involved in the production of backbone molecules for the synthesis of naringenin include phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI) ( Zhao et al., 2020 ). Herein, we analyzed the expression of five PALs , one C4H , three 4CLs, one CHS and one CHI genes in the two varieties during fruit development by both, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR. Among them, CgPAL3 and CgPAL4 were significantly differentially expressed at the two early developmental stages ( S1 and S2 ); they may thus be the key structural genes for the control of naringenin biosynthesis.",
          "As illustrated in Fig. 4 , naringenin is further converted to different classes of flavonoids by various enzymes ( Pfeiffer and Hegedűs, 2011 ). In the pathway of flavanone and flavone (the branch labeled green in Fig. 4 ), flavone synthase (FNS) is the key enzyme for the formation of apigenin; then, luteolin and diosmin are produced by F3′H (flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase)/F3′5′H (flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase) and O -methyltransferases, respectively. Naringenin and apigenin are precursors of flavanone/flavone-7- O -glucosides catalyzed by 7- O -glucosyltransferase (Cg7GlcT). Furthermore, many diverse metabolites are generated by the catalysis of 1,2-rhamnosyltransferase or 1,6-rhamnosyltransferase which leads to the attachment of rhamnose to C-2 or C-6 of the glucose moiety. This structural difference results in bitter or tasteless flavonoids, namely neohesperidosides or rutinosides. Frydman et al. first reported a key structural gene, i.e., Cm1, 2RhaT, to be involved in the biosynthesis of bitter flavonoids (flavanone/flavone-7- O -neohesperidosides, naringin and rhoifolin in this study) of Citrus , and provided the molecular and enzymatic basis of the bitter/non-bitter flavor of citrus fruits ( Frydman et al., 2004 ). Recently, Chen et al. investigated the genetic variations of 1, 2RhaT and 1, 6RhaT genes in different Citrus species and identified candidate MYB and bHLH TFs likely involved in regulating the accumulation of flavanone neohesperidoside ( Chen et al., 2021 ). Of importance, however, our study identified additional MYB TFs potentially involved in controlling flavonoid biosynthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits, and six of the 11 identified MYBs ( CgMYB4, CgMYB46 , CgMYB59 , CgMYB74 , CgMYB103 , and CgMYB108 ) belong to the R2R3-MYB subfamily, members of which are important for regulating flavonoid biosynthesis ( Xu et al., 2015 ). In Arabidopsis , MYB4 was reported to play a dual role in the inhibition of flavonoid biosynthesis and interacts with the bHLH TFs TT8, GL3 and EGL3 to interfere with the transcriptional activity of the MBW complex, and it represses the AROGENATE DEHYDRATASE 6 ( ADT6 ) gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the flavonoid precursor phenylalanine ( Wang et al., 2020b ). In the present study, the expression profile of CgMYB4 and the contents of naringenin were notably negatively correlated (r = −0.95). In addition, the closest homologous gene of CgMYB88 (Cg1g013930) in Arabidopsis is MYBD (AT1G70000) which has been reported to play a positive role in anthocyanin accumulation in response to light and cytokinins via repression of MYBL2 ( Nguyen et al., 2015 ). CgMYB88 was also suggested as an activator of the accumulation of flavonoids in the fruits of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. CgMYB1R1 ( Cg4g016300 ) was significantly differently expressed between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ at all fruit developmental stages. and MYB1R1 was also reported to be highly correlated with cotton's phenylpropanoid metabolites ( Tang et al., 2021 ) and involved in the ‘Pingguo’ pear's anthocyanin biosynthesis ( Liu et al., 2019 ).",
          "Moreover, as the MBW (MYB-bHLH-WD40) ternary complex functions as a transcriptional activator of flavonoid biosynthesis ( Qin et al., 2021 ) we also investigated WD40 family members and identified two promising candidates ( Cg5g039090 and Cg2g017030 ) for the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. Notably, the key structural gene of isoflavonoid biosynthesis ( CgIFS , isoflavone synthase) whose expression is highly (r > 0.95, p < 0.05) correlated with the content of glycitin in the comparison ZM-4 vs . GQ-4 ( Table S15 ) was identified. Similarly, expression levels of the R2R3-MYB gene CgMYB74 (r > 0.94, p < 0.01) and of the bHLH TF CgbHLH162.4 (r > 0.96, p < 0.01) showed a high correlation with glycitin content on comparing ZM-4 vs. GQ-4 comparison ( Table S15 ). Therefore, both TFs, therefore, represent excellent candidates for future studies on the transcriptional control of isoflavonoid biosynthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits.",
          "In summary, by comparing fruits of two different C. grandis varieties at four developmental stages, we found that ‘ZM’, which is the authentic raw material for the production of ‘Huajuhong’ TCM, contained more types and levels of flavonoids than those in ‘GQ’, a locally produced and freshly consumed pomelo. We also identified structural genes and TFs likely involved in controlling flavonoid biosynthesis, which provides an important basis for future research on the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in C. grandis ."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Citrus grandis ‘Tomentosa’ of the genus Citrus is an ancient variety of C. grandis (L.) Osbeck (pomelo). Unlike freshly consumed pomelo, immature ‘Tomentosa’ fruits are processed and utilized as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), called ‘Huajuhong’ in Chinese, which is famous for resolving phlegm, suppressing cough and calming panting. C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ originated from the Huazhou area located in the Guangzhou Province of southern China, and received a China Geographical Indication (GI) protection status ( Li et al., 2014 ). ‘Tomentosa’ fruits contain considerable amounts of flavonoids possessing various pharmaceutical properties such as antioxidant, antigenotoxic ( Bacanli et al., 2015 ), anti-hyperlipidemic ( Xu et al., 2012 ), and neuroprotective ( Gopinath and Sudhandiran, 2016 ) activities. Naringin, as one of the main chemical components in ‘Huajuhong’, may have potential to treat pulmonary diseases ( Luo et al., 2013 ). Due to long-term sexual propagation, multiple varieties of C. grandis are currently used for the production of ‘Huajuhong’. In a previous study, we evaluated and compared major bioactive chemical components and their antioxidant activities in the fruits of six C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ varieties ( Fan et al., 2019 ). Among the different varieties, ‘ZhengMao’ (‘ZM’) fruits are covered with a thick layer of trichomes, while the surface of ‘GuangQing’ (‘GQ’) fruits is smooth because of the absence of trichomes. The medicinal effect of ‘ZM’ is significantly better than that of ‘GQ’ and the fruits of ‘ZM’ are, therefore, best used as a raw material for ‘Huajuhong’ production. Although we had evaluated the contents of naringin and rhoifolin ( Fan et al., 2019 ), changes in their levels during fruit development have not yet been analyzed. In addition, an analysis of the wider spectrum of flavonoids accumulating in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits will be beneficial for establishing a solid basis for the high medicinal quality of ‘ZM.’ Moreover, research on flavonoid biosynthesis pathways and underlying genes is important for breeding and biotechnological improvement of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ germplasm. Importantly, the knowledge gained from this research can be used for the synthesis of important metabolites in microbial systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae using synthetic biology. This will provide a sustainable raw material for the future production of TCM. The flavonoid synthesis pathway, an important class of secondary metabolites in plants, has been comprehensively investigated ( Shen et al., 2022 ). Enzymes encoded by structural genes like PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE ( PAL ), CINNAMATE 4-HYDROXYLASE ( C4H ), 4 -COUMARATE-COA LIGASE (4CL), CHALCONE SYNTHASE ( CHS ), and CHALCONE ISOMERASE ( CHI ) are responsible for the generation of naringenin which is the primary precursor of specific flavonoids in the citrus family ( Chen et al., 2021 ). The conserved MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) ternary complex plays an important role in regulating the expression of the structural genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway ( Jaakola, 2013 ; Xu et al., 2015 ). Most of the studies have been conducted in model plants and often with respect to the production of flavonoid-based pigments. In Citrus sinensis , the bHLH transcription factor (TF) CsMYC2 was found to be potentially involved in the regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis ( Cultrone et al., 2009 ). Additionally, the R2R3-MYB TF Ruby activates anthocyanin accumulation in blood citrus fruits ( Butelli et al., 2012 ). Subsequently, CsMYB3 was discovered as a transcriptional repressor to form an ‘activation and repression’ loop with CsRuby1 for the stable accumulation of anthocyanins in C. sinensis ( Huang et al., 2020 ). In purple pomelo, another MYB TF, CgRuby2, acts as a repressor by competitively binding to CgbHLH1, like CgRuby1 ( Huang et al., 2018 ). Due to long juvenile phase and a high degree of heterozygosity in Citrus ( Cultrone et al., 2009 ), performing classical genetic studies to elucidate the molecular basis of flavonoid biosynthesis remains difficult. With the reduced costs of generating omics datasets and the availability of multiple bioinformatics tools, integrated omics approaches have become increasingly popular in plant research ( Wang et al., 2022 ; Wu et al., 2021 ). Omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics can reveal the spatial and/or temporal dynamics of a biological system, and by integrating multi-omics datasets a holistic view of the system analyzed can be obtained ( Jiang et al., 2022 ; Riano-Pachon et al., 2009 ). In this way, biologists can discover pathways for the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites ( Rai et al., 2017 ) and identify their regulators. Here, we systematically investigated the ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ varieties by a combined analysis of their transcriptomes and metabolomes to reveal the flavonoids and genes supporting the medicinal quality of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits. To this end, we performed an untargeted metabolic analysis of immature ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits at different developmental stages (2–8 cm in diameter), followed by targeted verification and quantitation of flavonoids. We also profiled the transcriptomes of those fruits by RNA-seq, and determined differentially accumulated metabolites and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and correlations between them. Finally, we revealed 25 enzyme-encoding genes of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in ‘Tomentosa’ fruits and genes of 16 transcription-related proteins (including MYBs, bHLHs, and WD40-repeat proteins) as potential candidates for the regulation of flavonoid synthesis. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant material C. grandis ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits of different sizes (2, 4, 6, and 8 cm in diameter) were harvested in 2020 from a preservation orchard belonging to Huazhou Pummelo Peel Medical Materials Development Co., Ltd. ( www.huajuhong.com ) certified for Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) by the Chinese government in Hexi District, Huazhou, Guangdong province. For each developmental stage, three biological replicates were obtained, each including at least three fruits. After harvest, the fruits were chopped into small pieces, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Before the experiments, the plant material was lyophilized and ground into powders which was sieved through a 100-μm mesh to obtain homogenous samples. 2.2 Chemical reagents HPLC-grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, and 2-chlorobenzalanine (98.5% purity) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai, China). Chemical standards of catechin, puerarin, rutin, naringin, diosmin, fisetin, daidzein, icariin, kaempferol, and chrysin were purchased from the Aladdin Reagent. L-epicatechin, dihydromyricetin, daidzin, vitexin, isovitexin, cynaroside, quercetin 3-glucoside, taxifolin, astragalin, quercitrin, genistin, myricetin, liquiritigenin, glycitein, luteolin, quercetin, apigenin, formononetin, kaempferide and biochanin A were purchased from Chengdu Herbpurify (Chengdu, China). Baicalin, silybin, naringenin, and genistein were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2.3 Metabolite extraction and untargeted LC-MS analysis First, 200 mg (±1%) of the samples were accurately weighed and 0.6 mL 2-chlorophenylalanine methanol (4 ppm; pre-cooled at −20 °C) was added. The mixture was vortex-shacked for 30 s, and ultrasonication was conducted for 15 min at 25 °C. Second, extraction of the metabolites was performed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm (microcentrifuge). Finally, 300 μL supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Tianjin JinTeng Instrument Company, Tianjin, China) to obtain samples for LC-MS. To monitor deviations caused by the analytical instrument itself, a quality control (QC) sample was also analyzed by mixing 20 μL of each individual sample. The LC-MS analysis was conducted based on our previous protocol ( Fan et al., 2020 ) with some modifications, and six replicates of each sample were analyzed. After conversion of the LC-MS data to mzXML format files, XCMS ( www.bioconductor.org ) was used for the identification, filtration, and alignment of peaks. The exact molecular weight was used to confirm each metabolite, and possible empirical formulae of the metabolites were speculated (molecular weight error <20 ppm). For multivariate statistical analysis, the XCMS output was further processed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft), and the normalized data were imported into Simca-P software (version 11.0; Umetrics AB, www.umetrics.com/simca ). All data were mean-centered and unit variance (UV)-scaled before applying PCA and PLS–DA to guard against overfitting. A default 7-fold (leave-1/7th samples-out) cross-validation procedure and 100-random permutation testing were carried out to ensure that the supervised PLS-DA models do not overfit. These discriminating metabolites were obtained using a statistically significant threshold for variable influence on projection (VIP > 1.0). Values were obtained from the PLS–DA model and further validated via Student's t-test (p < 0.05). Metabolites with VIP values above 1.0 and p values below 0.05 were selected as discriminating metabolites between the two classes of samples. Multivariate data analyses including PCA, PLS-DA, and orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) were conducted using the R (version 3.3.2) package ropls with methods described previously ( Thévenot et al., 2015 ). The ropls package is available from the Bioconductor repository ( Gentleman et al., 2004 ). Differentiated metabolites between two classes of samples were identified using a statistically significant threshold of VIP ≥ 1 and further validated by one-way univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p ≤ 0.05). To investigate the metabolic pathways, the identified metabolites were aligned to biochemical pathways provided by KEGG ( http://www.kegg.jp/pathway).To investigate metabolic pathways, the identified metabolites were aligned to biochemical pathways provided by KEGG ( http://www.kegg.jp/pathway ). 2.4 Flavonoid extraction and quantitative LC-MS determination The samples were mixed with 2 mL methanol and ultrasonicated at 25 °C for 60 min. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm (microcentrifuge) for 3 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Tianjin JinTeng Instrument Company) and tested at Waters ACQUITY UPLC (AB 4000) with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters) maintained at 40 °C. Elution A of water containing 0.1% formic acid and elution B of acetonitrile were applied. An increasing linear gradient of elution B was set as follows: 0–1 min, 10% B; 1–3 min, 10%–33% B; 3–5 min, 33% B; 5–7 min, 33%–90% B; 7–8.5 min, 90% B; 8.5–10 min, 90%–100% B; 10–13 min, 10% B. The injection was 5 μL, and the flow rate was set at 0.25 mL/min. As for the conditions of MS, electrospray ionization (ESI) source and negative ion ionization mode were applied. The temperature of ion source was set at 500 °C, and the voltage of ion source was −4.5 kV. Collision gas and curtain gas was set at 6 and 30 arbitrary units, respectively. Sheath gas and auxiliary gas were set at 50 arbitrary units. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used for scanning. Ions for quantitative analysis are provided in Table S1 . 2.5 RNA extraction, library construction, sequencing and data analysis Total RNA was extracted from each sample according to our previous protocol ( Tian et al., 2022 ). The RNA-seq was performed by Gene Denovo Biotechnology (Guangzhou, China), using a protocol described previously ( Wang et al., 2020a ), with minor modifications. RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and checked using RNase-free agarose gel electrophoresis. Then the enriched mRNA was fragmented into short fragments using fragmentation buffer and reverse-transcribed into cDNA by using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #7530; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The purified double-stranded cDNA fragments were end-repaired, A base added, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation reaction was purified with the AMPure XP Beads (1.0X). Ligated fragments were subjected to size selection by agarose gel electrophoresis and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resulting cDNA library was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument. Bioinformatics analysis including filtering of raw reads, alignment with the pomelo reference genome ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/index.php , Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck. cv. ‘Wanbaiyou’ v1.0), the quantification of gene abundance, and the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were carried out by Gene Denovo Biotechnology. Briefly, after filtering of raw reads, an index of the reference genome was built, and paired-end clean reads were mapped to the abovementioned pomelo reference genome using HISAT (version 2.2.4) ( Kim et al., 2015 ) and other parameters set as a default. The repeatability of the data was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) performed by R ( Shen et al., 2014 ). Genes were de novo -assembled using StringTie (version 2.0) ( Pertea et al., 2015 ) with default parameters and annotated according to the GFF files of the reference genome of pomelo ( Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck. cv. ‘Wanbaiyou’ v1.0, http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/download.php ). Genes that were not previously annotated in the C. grandis genome were considered as novel genes. TFs were identified by comparison with the TFs provided in the PlantTFDB database (version 3.0) ( Pertea et al., 2015 ), using hmmscan ( http://hmmer.org ), resulting in 1290 TFs. Differential expression between two different groups was performed by DESeq2 software ( Love et al., 2014 ). Genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.05 and absolute fold change ≥ 2 were considered as DEGs. 2.6 Weighted gene co-expression network analysis Co-expression networks were constructed using the WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) package (v1.47) in R ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 ). The WGCNA was performed by Gene Denovo Biotechnology as previously described ( Niu et al., 2020 ), with minor modifications. Briefly, WGCNA includes network construction, module and gene selection, and the functional analysis of module genes. First, 14,109 genes with extremely low expression levels in all samples were removed and the expression values of the remaining 17,401 genes were imported into WGCNA to construct coexpression modules using the automatic network construction function blockwiseModules with default settings, except that the power was 12, TOMType was unsigned, mergeCutHeight was 0.7, and minModuleSize was 50. The networks were visualized using Cytoscape v3.3.0 ( Shannon et al., 2003 ). To identify biologically significant modules, module eigengenes were used to calculate the correlation coefficients with the sample traits. We used the contents of 16 flavonoids as the sample traits. 2.7 GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed by mapping DEGs to GO terms in the Gene Ontology database ( http://www.geneontology.org/ ) and pathways in KEGG ( http://www.kegg.jp/pathway ), respectively. Gene numbers were then calculated for every term/pathway, and GO terms or KEGG pathways with corrected p value ≤ 0.05 were considered as significantly enriched. 2.8 Cis-element analysis For cis -acting element analysis, the promoter sequences of the structural genes from C. grandis which were in the 2000-bp upstream region were obtained from an online database ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/seqFetch/query.php ). Then, the cis-acting elements were analyzed using the PlantCARE database ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ ) and were illustrated by an online program of the gene structure display server (GSDS2.0) ( http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/index.php ) ( Hu et al., 2015 ). 2.9 RT-qPCR Real-time quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR) was conducted as follows. Briefly, the extracted total RNA was first treated with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Dalian, Japan), and then cDNA was obtained using a reverse transcription kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CgACTIN7 was used as reference to normalize the expression levels of genes and calculated by the comparative 2 −ΔΔCt method. Primers for RT-qPCR are listed in Table S2 . The data are presented as means ± standard deviation of three independent biological replicates each. 3 Results 3.1 Metabolite profiling of ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ during fruit development As premature fruits of Citrus grandis ‘Tomentosa’ are utilized for medicinal purposes, we harvested ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits at 2, 4, 6, and 8 cm diameters (indicated as S1, S2, S3, and S4; Fig. 1 A) and employed UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS/MS to perform a global untargeted metabolite analysis. Fig. S1 illustrates the total ion chromatographs of all the samples in the positive and negative modes, respectively. Quality control (QC) was conducted to ensure the reliability of the methodology and data. As shown in Figs. S2A and B , principal component analysis (PCA) revealed densely gathered data patterns in both positive and negative modes indicating reliability of the data ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 ). In order to discover biomarkers, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of potential characteristic peaks in QC samples should not exceed 30%, otherwise the relevant characteristic peaks should be deleted ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 ) which is the quality assurance. In Fig. S1B , the proportion of characteristic peaks with RSD < 30% is higher than 70% in positive mode which further validates the reliability of the obtained data ( Want et al., 2010 ). The results of PCA as shown in Fig. S3 indicated that there were general differences in the total metabolites between the ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ groups and that the degree of variation between samples within the group was small. Notably, the variation between the groups of ‘ZM-6’ and ‘ZM-8’ was also small as well as the variation between ‘GQ-6’ and ‘GQ-8’. A total of 25,005 and 22,434 precursor molecules were obtained in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, 407 compounds were identified and detailed information including retention time (rt), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), exact mass, formula, KEGG ID, and the accurate molecular weight of metabolite errors (ppm) is provided in Table S1 . A total of 39 flavonoids including 14 flavanones/flavones, 5 isoflavonoids, 12 flavonols, 6 anthocyanins, and 2 backbones for the synthesis of flavonoids were identified, and their average intensities in the different samples are presented in Table S3 . The total intensity of each category was calculated to determine the contents of flavonoids in each sample. In order to further elucidate the chemical composition of the bioactive flavonoids, a targeted metabolic analysis was performed. The qualitative contents of 16 flavonoids, namely, naringin, rhoifolin, prunin, naringenin, isovitexin, rutin, vitexin, glycitin, cynaroside, diosmin, apigenin, isoquercetin, catechin, daidzin, luteolin and taxifolin were determined ( Fig. 1 B). Naringin, rhoifolin, prunin and naringenin are the top four flavonoids present in high levels in the fruits of Citrus grandis ‘Tomentosa’, in the mg/g range. The contents of naringin are extremely high, however, there is insignificant difference between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’, while the content of rhoifolin is significantly higher in ‘ZM’ than in ‘GQ’ at all four fruit developmental stages. The amounts of naringenin in ‘ZM’ fruits at S1 and S2 are higher than in ‘GQ’ ( p < 0.05). In addition, there are significant differences in the contents of rutin ( p < 0.01), isovitexin ( p < 0.05), vitexin ( p < 0.05), glycitin ( p < 0.05), and daidzin ( p < 0.01) between S1 fruits of ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’. In summary, ‘ZM’ fruits contain more flavonoids than ‘GQ’. 3.2 RNA sequencing of ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits at various developmental stages To investigate genes contributing to flavonoid synthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits, we sequenced the transcriptomes of the same samples and annotated the sequencing reads to the genome of C. grandis . An overview of the transcriptome sequencing data including quality check information is presented in Table S4 . For each sample, the Q20 and Q30 percentages were higher than 96% and 90%, respectively, and the average GC content was 46.0% in all libraries. In each library, the percentage of total valid reads mapped to the reference genome was higher than 94%. Correlations between samples were checked ( Fig. S4 ) revealing good reproducibility between the three biological replicates. PCA of ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ groups at four developmental stages was performed to examine the data variation among different groups. As illustrated in Fig. S5 , small degree of variations were observed for the two varieties in the same developmental stages which indicated the similar genomic backgound of ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’. However, the PCA results from the metabolomic data exhibits the opposite. Hence, we might obtain useful molecular information based on the metabolome results via comparing the transcriptomes of the two varieties. In addition to 30,123 annotated genes in the reference genome, we discovered 1,387 previously unidentified genes (see Table S5 for detailed information). Gene expression levels are presented as Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) values calculated from the read counts. As expected, the global gene expression profiles were similar among all samples analyzed ( Fig. 2 A). DEGs were identified by comparing each sample pair under the conditions of a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a |log2FC(fold change)| > 1. Fig. 2 B shows the number of up- and down-regulated genes within varieties (to compare different fruit developmental stages) and between varieties (to compare the fruits in the same stages). The greatest number of DEGs was identified when comparing ZM-2 vs. ZM-4 (3,522 genes; 1,857 up, 1,665 down), followed by the comparison of GQ-2 vs. GQ-4 (3,431 genes; 1,843 up, 1,588 down), indicating major developmental shifts between these two fruit stages in both varieties. Many genes were also differentially expressed when identical fruit stages of different cultivars where compared; the largest difference was observed in the comparison ZM-4 vs . GQ-4 (2,724 genes). Furthermore, Venn analysis revealed 646 genes that were differently expressed between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ throughout all four developmental fruit stages ( Fig. 2 C and Table S6 ). GO classification analysis revealed that many genes related to ‘biological process’, ‘cellular component’, and ‘molecular function’ were included in the DEGs ( Fig. S6A ). The most significantly enriched biological process was observed in ‘response to external stimulus’ (GO:0009605), cellular process was ‘ribonucleoprotein granule’ (GO:0035770), and molecular function was ‘chromatin binding’ (GO:0003682) ( Fig. S6 BCD and Table S7 ). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed 65 enriched metabolic pathways ( Table S8 ), with ‘glutathione metabolism’ showing the strongest enrichment ( Fig. S7 ). TFs are crucial cellular regulators of essentially all developmental and physiological processes, and they likely also contribute to the pharmacological differences between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits. Therefore, we analyzed our transcriptome data to identify TFs differentially expressed between the two varieties at the four developmental fruit stages. A total of 109, 169, 106, and 108 TFs, respectively, were differentially expressed between the groups ZM-2 vs . GQ-2, ZM-4 vs . GQ-4, ZM-6 vs . GQ-6, and ZM-8 vs . GQ-8. Expression levels and statistical data of the TFs are presented in Table S9 . Considering the crucial role of MYB and bHLH TFs for controlling flavonoid biosynthesis, genes encoding them were further examined. Interestingly, two C. grandis MYB genes, i.e., Cg4g016300 and Cg5g039960 , were significantly differentially expressed between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ at all fruit developmental stages, suggesting they might be related to the differential accumulation of flavonoids in the fruits of the two cultivars. To further narrow down genes and TFs controlling flavonoid biosynthesis we conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) for the transcriptome data. First, genes with extremely low expression levels in all samples were removed to ensure accuracy of the network building (for details, see Materials and methods). A gene clustering tree was then constructed, considering the correlations between gene expression levels. Gene modules were established based on clustering relationships, i.e., genes with similar expression patterns were classified into the same module. The modules were generated by cutting off branches from the dendrogram. Dynamic Tree Cut is the primary classification method used to define modules ( Langfelder et al., 2008 ). Finally, similar modules were merged, and 18 modules were obtained, as shown in Fig. 3 A, where each color, i.e., brown, blue etc., represents a module, and gray represents genes that could not be classified into any module. The number of genes and TFs in each module is shown in Fig. S8 . Paleturquoise, thistle3, and darkmagenta are the top three modules including the highest number of genes, i.e., 4,064, 2,313, and 1,885, respectively, while the numbers of TFs in modules paleturquoise (234), darkmagenta (179), and brown (151) were above hundred. In Fig. 3 B, the three largest modules (paleturquoise, darkmagenta, and brown) were distributed in different subunits, reflecting of different expression patterns of the genes in those modules. Some modules showed strong correlations, such as the blue and brown2 modules ( Fig. 3 B), as the genes in these modules exhibit similar expression patterns during the various developmental stages of the two varieties. The WGCNA result provides important information about modules of highly correlated genes which can be integrated with metabolomic data for the identification of relevant gene clusters. 3.3 Combined transcriptomic and metabolic analysis To understand flavonoid synthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits, the metabolite and transcriptional data were investigated together. To this end, the correlation between the WGCNA modules and the contents of 16 flavonoids was analyzed. Fig. 3 B shows the of correlation coefficients and corresponding p values. According to the correlation values, the paleturquoise module is significantly ( p < 0.001) positively correlated with catechin (r = 0.81), vitexin (r = 0.64), and isovitexin (r = 0.62). The darkmagenta module showed significant ( p < 0.001) positive correlations with naringenin (r = 0.79), prunin (r = 0.77), and isoquercetin (r = 0.69). The highest correlation value was observed for mediumorchid and isovitexin content (r = 0.88, p = 2e-08). For naringin and rhoifolin, lightcyan and blue are the two most correlated modules, respectively. In other words, the genes in these modules might be involved in the process of the flavonoid metabolism. Furthermore, hub genes in these modules were analyzed based on the intramodular connectivity. The selected hub genes as shown in Table S10 could be important regulators for the biosynthesis of flavonoids. A total of 845 hub genes were selected according to the intensity of connectivity ranking in top 10% ( Table S10 ). The annotation of KEGG pathways and GO terms for those hub genes were also presented in Table S10 to further classify the hub genes. Notably, the most significantly enriched molecular function was ‘UDP-glucosyltransferase activity’ (GO:0035251) ( Fig. S9 ), as reported previously, glycosylation catalyzed by glycosyltransferases plays an important role in regulating the stability, availability, and biological activity of flavonoids ( Dong et al., 2020 ). The pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis, beginning with phenylalanine, is illustrated in Fig. 4 , which includes the results of the metabolite profiling. The expression of the main structural genes in ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ throughout fruit development is shown in heatmaps ( Fig. 4 ), next to the pathway. The FPKM value of each structural gene and the respective WGCNA module to which it belongs to are Table S11 . The pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis (isoflavonoid, flavanone and flavone, flavonol and anthocyanin) are illustrated in different colors, and a summary of the metabolite ion intensity of each pathway is shown in the heatmaps ( Fig. 4 ). The total intensity data of flavonoids are listed in Table S3 . As can be seen, the contents of flavonoids derived from the isoflavonoid, and flavanone and flavone pathways are higher in ‘ZM’ than in ‘GQ’ fruits, while the total metabolite ion intensity from the flavonol and anthocyanin pathways is stronger in ‘GQ’ fruits. As shown in Fig. 4 , the expression levels of CgCHS in all samples were extremely high compared with other structural genes such as CgPAL1 , Cg4CL1 and CgCHI . In the backbone pathway ( Fig. 4 ), expression levels of CgPAL1 , CgPAL2 , CgPAL3 , CgPAL4 , CgPAL5 , CgC4H , and Cg4CL1 were highest in the Stage 4 of the fruits (8 cm) for the two varieties ( Table S11 ). Considering the lowest contents of the flavonoids from the backbone pathway, those genes might be also involved in other biological process. However, the relative higher expression levels of Cg4CL2 , Cg4CL3 , CgCHS , and CgCHI in smaller fruits suggests these genes were important for the biosynthesis of naringenin, which is the precursor for the diversified synthesis of flavonoids. Cg1, 2RhaT (1,2-rhamnosyltransferase) which is a key enzymatic gene for the biosynthesis of naringin ( Frydman et al., 2004 ) shows different expression patterns in ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ fruits, as well as CgFNS (flavone synthase) which is essential for the biosynthesis of rhoifolin. Hence, those two genes might play important role for the produce of naringin and rhoifolin. In summary, the flavonoid biosynthesis is influenced through transcriptional levels of some structural genes. As shown in Table S11 , structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis mainly belong to the paleturquoise and darkmagenta modules. The predicted cis -elements of these structural genes are presented in Fig. S10 and Table S12 . MYB and MYC binding sites were observed in all structural genes. Considering this, we focused our further analysis on TFs of the MYB and bHLH families, as well as on WD40-repeat proteins, which form a complex with these two types of TFs to regulate flavonoid biosynthesis ( Table S13 ). Twenty-eight MYB , nine bHLH , and one WD40 genes were present in the paleturquoise module, while16 MYB, 12 bHLH , and 1 WD40 genes are included in the darkmagenta module. We selected 21 MYB, 12 bHLH , and 1 WD40 genes, considering their expression levels and connectivity, to illustrate their transcriptional regulatory network for flavonoid biosynthesis in the paleturquoise and darkmagenta modules ( Fig. 5 ). The gene IDs and names of the TFs are listed in Table S14 . Next, we searched for potential correlation of the 16 selected flavonoids with the DEGs between the 16 selected flavonoids in the groups ZM-2 vs . GQ-2, ZM-4 vs . GQ-4, ZM-6 vs . GQ-6, and ZM-8 vs . GQ-8. The correlation and p values of the main structural genes and selected MYB , bHLH and WD40 family genes with relatively high expression levels are shown in Table S15 . Pearson correlation coefficients between the four sets of groups compared were further examined to identify genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. On comparing ZM-2 vs . GQ-2, five MYB members ( CgMYB4 , CgMYB15, CgMYB74 , CgMYB103 , and CgMYB167 ) were sorted out. Among them, the expression level of CgMYB103 was positively correlated with naringenin content with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.83, whereas CgMYB4 and naringenin content were negatively correlated (r = −0.95). CgMYB74 (r = 0.95) and CgMYB167 (r = 0.96) were significantly positively correlated with rutin content, whereas CgMYB4 and rutin content were negatively correlated (r = −0.91). For comparing ZM-4 vs . GQ-4, seven MYB and three bHLH genes ( CgMYB4 , CgMYB59 , CgMYB74 , CgMYB77 , CgMYB88 , CgMYB108 , CgMYB111.1 , CgbHLH92 , CgbHLH140 , CgbHLH162.4 ) were selected. Among them, two MYBs ( CgMYB74 and CgMYB108 ) and one bHLH ( CgbHLH162.4 ) were highly positively correlated with naringenin content, with a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.90. Expression of CgMYB74 was also positively correlated with the levels of luteolin (r = 0.92), taxifolin (r = 0.94), and glycitin (r = 0.94) levels. Notably, CgMYB4 expression was negatively correlated with almost all flavonoid content except catechin (r = 0.83) and prunin (r = 0.94) contents. The expression levels of CgMYB111.1 and CgbHLH140 was comparable to that of CgMYB4 . Since prunin is the precursor metabolite of flavanones and flavones, we inferred that CgMYB4, CgMYB111.1 and CgbHLH140 repress the production of flavonoids in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits. Other TFs including CgMYB59, CgMYB74, CgMYB108, CgMYB77, CgMYB88, CgbHLH92, and CgbHLH162.4 activate the biosynthesis of flavonoids. In the group of ZM-6 vs. GQ-6, the expression levels of three MYBs ( CgMYB15 , CgMYB46 and CgMYB77 ) and one WD40 ( Cg1g012600 ) were significantly positively correlated with the content of rhoifolin content (r > 0.90, p < 0.05). In the group of ZM-8 vs. GQ-8, a WD40 member ( Cg2g017030 ) was highly (r < −0.95, p < 0.01) negatively correlated with the contents of diosmin and rhoifolin which are derived from the flavanone and flavone biosynthesis pathway. In summary, nine MYB ( CgMYB15, CgMYB46 , CgMYB59 , CgMYB74 , CgMYB77 , CgMYB88 , CgMYB103 , CgMYB108 , CgMYB167 ), two bHLH ( CgbHLH162.4 and CgbHLH92 ), and one WD ( Cg1g012600 ) genes were identified as candidate activators, and two MYB ( CgMYB4 and CgMYB111.1 ), one bHLH ( CgbHLH140 ) and one WD ( Cg2g017030 ) genes were identified as promising repressors for the biosynthesis of flavonoids in the fruits of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. 3.4 RT-qPCR To verify the results obtained from transcriptome sequencing of the selected flavonoid-biosynthesis and TF genes, RT-qPCR was conducted. As shown in Fig. 6 , the relative expression levels of the main structural genes in the flavonoid pathway and CgMYB genes were consistent with the results obtained by RNA-seq analysis. 4 Discussion Flavonoids were proved to have potential to reduce mortality through a diet rich in plant-derived foods ( Bondonno et al., 2019 ). As a recognized Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with China Geographical Indication GI) protection ( Li et al., 2014 ), the chemical, and potentially pharmacologically active components, particularly the flavonoids, of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits have attracted much attention. In the present study, the contents of four flavonoids (naringin, rhoifolin, prunin and naringenin) are relatively high (in grade of mg/g dry mass), especially naringin which in some studies appeared to be effective against chronic cough ( Luo et al., 2013 ) and to provide lung protection ( Chen et al., 2013 ). The second highest is rhoifolin, and preclinical studies have shown that it possesses a variety of significant biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and anticancer effects ( Refaat et al., 2015 ). The monoglycoside flavonoid prunin also shows biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, anticancer, antiviral and neuroprotective activities ( Carceller et al., 2019 ). In addition, the bioavailability and cardioprotective action of naringenin have been examined by some clinical studies ( Salehi et al., 2019 ). In our previous study, we compared naringin and rhoifolin in three tissues (exocarp, mesocarp, and pulp) of six varieties of C. grandis fruits and observed significant differences in the contents of naringin and rhoifolin between the tissues analyzed ( Fan et al., 2019 ). Duan et al. identified ten flavonoids from the fruits, leaves, branches, and flowers of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ ( Duan et al., 2014 ). Different from the freshly consumed pomelo, fruits of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ are utilized for the production of the Chinese medicine ‘Huajuhong’. However, some profiteers used locally produced pomelo as raw material to produce fake ‘Huajuhong’ which has a dramatically lower medicinal effect than the genuine product; for a typical customer it is virtually impossible to distinguish between the two products. Therefore, it is important to develop solid quality standards in the production of ‘Huajuhong’ that can be controlled by health authorities. The unique chemical composition of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits can be helpful in this respect. In addition, integrated metabolic and transcriptome analyses can provide clues for the mining of key regulatory genes that are important for both the breeding of new plant cultivars and the production of interesting metabolites in microbial systems using synthetic biological approaches. C. grandis ‘ZM’ is a typical variety for the production of ‘Huajuhong’, and ‘GQ’ is the locally cultivated pomelo. A total of 39 flavonoids including 14 flavanones/flavones, five isoflavonoids, 12 flavonols, six anthocyanins were identified, and 16 of them were further quantitatively measured in ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ varieties. While naringin content was similar in the two varieties, ‘ZM’ contained more rhoifolin than that in ‘GQ’ throughout fruit development, indicating it might be an important specialized flavonoid in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. In addition, eight flavonoids (isovitexin, vitexin, glycitin, cynaroside, diosmin, daidzin, luteolin and taxifolin) were detected and identified for the first time in ‘Tomentosa’ fruits. ‘Huajuhong’ is produced from fruits of 6–8 cm in diameter. Our finding that the contents of rhoifolin, isovitexin, rutin, vitexin, diosmin, apigenin, isoquercetin, and catechin are significantly different between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ might, therefore, be of medical relevance for contributing to the pharmacological properties of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. These flavonoids may potentially be utilized as biomarkers to distinguish bona fide ‘Huajuhong’ from fake products. Isoflavonoids are predominantly abundant in Papilionoideae, a subfamily of the Leguminosae ( Dixon and Sumner, 2003 ). However, isoflavonoids have also been identified in non-leguminous plant families, including Iridaceae, Moraceae, Liliaceae, Compositae, and Meliaceae ( Al-Maharik, 2019 ). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of isoflavonoids (glycitin and daidzin) in a species of the Rutaceae. In citrus fruits, as in other plants, flavonoids are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway which involves three main phases: precursor ( p -coumaroyl-CoA) synthesis; the synthesis of flavanones, flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins; and finally the formation of various glycosides through glycosylation. Enzymes involved in the production of backbone molecules for the synthesis of naringenin include phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI) ( Zhao et al., 2020 ). Herein, we analyzed the expression of five PALs , one C4H , three 4CLs, one CHS and one CHI genes in the two varieties during fruit development by both, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR. Among them, CgPAL3 and CgPAL4 were significantly differentially expressed at the two early developmental stages ( S1 and S2 ); they may thus be the key structural genes for the control of naringenin biosynthesis. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , naringenin is further converted to different classes of flavonoids by various enzymes ( Pfeiffer and Hegedűs, 2011 ). In the pathway of flavanone and flavone (the branch labeled green in Fig. 4 ), flavone synthase (FNS) is the key enzyme for the formation of apigenin; then, luteolin and diosmin are produced by F3′H (flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase)/F3′5′H (flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase) and O -methyltransferases, respectively. Naringenin and apigenin are precursors of flavanone/flavone-7- O -glucosides catalyzed by 7- O -glucosyltransferase (Cg7GlcT). Furthermore, many diverse metabolites are generated by the catalysis of 1,2-rhamnosyltransferase or 1,6-rhamnosyltransferase which leads to the attachment of rhamnose to C-2 or C-6 of the glucose moiety. This structural difference results in bitter or tasteless flavonoids, namely neohesperidosides or rutinosides. Frydman et al. first reported a key structural gene, i.e., Cm1, 2RhaT, to be involved in the biosynthesis of bitter flavonoids (flavanone/flavone-7- O -neohesperidosides, naringin and rhoifolin in this study) of Citrus , and provided the molecular and enzymatic basis of the bitter/non-bitter flavor of citrus fruits ( Frydman et al., 2004 ). Recently, Chen et al. investigated the genetic variations of 1, 2RhaT and 1, 6RhaT genes in different Citrus species and identified candidate MYB and bHLH TFs likely involved in regulating the accumulation of flavanone neohesperidoside ( Chen et al., 2021 ). Of importance, however, our study identified additional MYB TFs potentially involved in controlling flavonoid biosynthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits, and six of the 11 identified MYBs ( CgMYB4, CgMYB46 , CgMYB59 , CgMYB74 , CgMYB103 , and CgMYB108 ) belong to the R2R3-MYB subfamily, members of which are important for regulating flavonoid biosynthesis ( Xu et al., 2015 ). In Arabidopsis , MYB4 was reported to play a dual role in the inhibition of flavonoid biosynthesis and interacts with the bHLH TFs TT8, GL3 and EGL3 to interfere with the transcriptional activity of the MBW complex, and it represses the AROGENATE DEHYDRATASE 6 ( ADT6 ) gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the flavonoid precursor phenylalanine ( Wang et al., 2020b ). In the present study, the expression profile of CgMYB4 and the contents of naringenin were notably negatively correlated (r = −0.95). In addition, the closest homologous gene of CgMYB88 (Cg1g013930) in Arabidopsis is MYBD (AT1G70000) which has been reported to play a positive role in anthocyanin accumulation in response to light and cytokinins via repression of MYBL2 ( Nguyen et al., 2015 ). CgMYB88 was also suggested as an activator of the accumulation of flavonoids in the fruits of C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. CgMYB1R1 ( Cg4g016300 ) was significantly differently expressed between ‘ZM’ and ‘GQ’ at all fruit developmental stages. and MYB1R1 was also reported to be highly correlated with cotton's phenylpropanoid metabolites ( Tang et al., 2021 ) and involved in the ‘Pingguo’ pear's anthocyanin biosynthesis ( Liu et al., 2019 ). Moreover, as the MBW (MYB-bHLH-WD40) ternary complex functions as a transcriptional activator of flavonoid biosynthesis ( Qin et al., 2021 ) we also investigated WD40 family members and identified two promising candidates ( Cg5g039090 and Cg2g017030 ) for the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’. Notably, the key structural gene of isoflavonoid biosynthesis ( CgIFS , isoflavone synthase) whose expression is highly (r > 0.95, p < 0.05) correlated with the content of glycitin in the comparison ZM-4 vs . GQ-4 ( Table S15 ) was identified. Similarly, expression levels of the R2R3-MYB gene CgMYB74 (r > 0.94, p < 0.01) and of the bHLH TF CgbHLH162.4 (r > 0.96, p < 0.01) showed a high correlation with glycitin content on comparing ZM-4 vs. GQ-4 comparison ( Table S15 ). Therefore, both TFs, therefore, represent excellent candidates for future studies on the transcriptional control of isoflavonoid biosynthesis in C. grandis ‘Tomentosa’ fruits. In summary, by comparing fruits of two different C. grandis varieties at four developmental stages, we found that ‘ZM’, which is the authentic raw material for the production of ‘Huajuhong’ TCM, contained more types and levels of flavonoids than those in ‘GQ’, a locally produced and freshly consumed pomelo. We also identified structural genes and TFs likely involved in controlling flavonoid biosynthesis, which provides an important basis for future research on the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in C. grandis .
