    "full_text": "Abstract Tarocco is a prevalent blood-orange variety in China, has a bud variant identified in Wenzhou City. To characterize the quality traits and molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition of anthocyanin synthesis in this variety, we collected fruits of Tarocco (WT) and the bud variant Ouya (MT) at nine developmental stages. Their anthocyanin, soluble sugar, and organic acid profiles were examined, and transcriptomes and metabolites were analyzed at three developmental stages. The results revealed that MT is a new blood orange variety with weak anthocyanins and a better sugar-acid ratio than the WT. The content of anthocyanin in MT fruits were significantly lower than those in WT fruits, especially cyanidin-like anthocyanins, while the flavone contents exhibited no remarkable variation. A total of 64 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including five transcription factors (TFs), five methylation-related genes, and one flavonoid biosynthesis gene, were identified between WT and MT at three fruit developmental stages. The potential regulatory networks of these TFs were further constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.Furthermore, in MT fruit treated with the 5-azacytidine, we observed hypomethylation of anthocyanins accumulated in the pulp and the promoters and genebodies of some anthocyanin synthesis-related genes. These results provide new insights into the influence of DNA methylation on anthocyanin accumulation in MT and also provide support for the promotion of MT as a new variety."

            "text": "The synthesis of anthocyanins, recognized as a critical determinant that exerts a profound impact on both the aesthetic and nutritional qualities of fruits, has long occupied a central position in the academic exploration of fruit quality [ 1 ]. Anthocyanins not only serve as an important basis for fruit color formation but also possess a range of valuable health-related benefits, such as enhancing visual acuity, preventing cardiovascular disorders, and reducing blood pressure [ 2 ]. Numerous studies have shown that the anthocyanin contents and color types of fruits are primarily determined by structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, including PAL , C4H , 4CL , CHS , CHI , F3H , ANS , DFR , UFGT , etc [ 3 , 4 ]., together with transcription factors (TFs), in conjunction withthe activity of TFs such as MYBs , bHLHs , WDRs , and BBXs [ 5 , 6 ]. In addition, external environmental factors (including light, temperature, hormones, and fungi), as well as epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation), have been established to influence the levels of anthocyanins accumulated in fruits [ 7 , 8 , 9 – 10 ]. For example, DNA methylation of the promoter region can inhibit the binding of TFs, thereby leading to lighter colored fruits in some varieties [ 11 ]. Conversely, inhibitors of DNA methylation, such as 5-azacytidine (5-aza), can block the action of DNA methyltransferase, thus promoting the regulatory effects of TFs [ 12 ]."

Osbeck) is the only anthocyanin-rich Citrus fruits grown on a large scale [ 14 , 15 ], of which ‘Tarocco’ is the most widely planted blood orange variety in China. Tarocco has been reported to have originated from a spontaneous bud mutation in a Sanguinello orchard during the early 1900s in Siracusa Province, Sicily [ 15 ], and it has been established that the molecular basis of the blood orange pigmentation involves the retrotransposon-mediated transcriptional activation of CsRuby (a MYB-like TF) [ 14 ]. In the ‘Moro’, another blood orange variety, the sequence upstream of this TF has been found to contains the 3ʹ-LTR portion of the TCS1 retrotransposon [ 14 ]. Despite no differences in the coding sequences of Ruby among multiple Tarocco and Sanguinello clones, considerable variations in the degrees of anthocyanin pigmentation were found in the pulp and peel [ 15 ], ranging from a few red vesicles to a deep reddish-purple coloration [ 16 ]."

Unlike Tarocco fruits, which typically display a distinct purplish-red color at maturity and after 30 days of postharvest storage at low temperature, the fruits of this variant remained orange-yellow color (Fig. S1B, C). The two varieties have similar flowering periods. In addition, compared with Tarocco plants, the margins of the bud variant leaves were crinkled (Fig. S1D). Notably, these variant traits were established to be stably inherited in the asexually reproduced plants. The aberrant fruit color trait is an established trait of the original ancestor’s and can thus be cited as an example of revertive inheritance. In contrast, the leaf-crumpling trait is not observed in sweet oranges, suggesting that this trait may have resulted from new genetic variation."

Ouya (MT) at different developmental stages to examine trait changes including fruit size and the contents of anthocyanins, soluble sugars, and organic acids. Moreover, we screened the core genes based on RNA-seq analysis to validate their functionality. In addition, we treated MT fruits with 5-aza and analyzed the expression and methylation levels of the core TFs and structural genes based on RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) procedures. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the low anthocyanin content in MT fruits, and also provide support for the promotion of MT as a new variety."

After removing genes with extremely low expression levels from the samples, 9571 genes were imported intoWGCNA with the following parameters: soft threshold was 12, network type was signed, minKMEtoStay was 0.3, mergeCutHeight was 0.45, and minModuleSize was 50. Regulatory network diagrams were constructed using Cytoscape 3.7.1 [ 24 ]. To identify biologically significant modules, module eigengenes were used to calculate correlation coefficients with the sample traits. We used the contents of four highest content anthocyanins, total anthocyanins, soluble sugars (including glucose, fructose, and sucrose), and organic acids (including quinic, malic, and citric acids) as sample traits."

Aliquots of approximately 1.0 mL were carefully injected into the equatorial plane of fruits using an HPLC syringe with a needle inserted into the fruits to a depth of approximately 0.3–0.5 cm. One half of each fruit was injected with 5-aza, while the other half was injected with sterile water as a control. The 5-aza and sterile water injections were subsequently repeated three to five times at 2-day intervals. After 7 days of treatment, the fruits were cut into two halves using a scalpel, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used for analysis. Samples obtained frompulp on both sides of the fruits were subjected to RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis (WGBS).

The TSS contents of MT were also significantly higher than those of WT. The TSS of MT exceeded 15 °Brix at 190 DAF and then remained between 14.91 and 15.80 °Brix.

Similarly, the total soluble sugar content of MT between 220 and 265 DAF was significantly higher than those recorded for WT (Fig. S2A). Citric acid was the most abundant among the three assessed organic acids (citric, quinic, and malic acid). In both varieties, the citric acid content gradually increased from 160 to 190 DAF and then declined, and the content in MT was significantly lower than that in WT. Comparatively, there was less variation in the contents of the other two organic acids (Fig. S2B). These differences in sugar and acid contents between MT and WT were reflected in the respective sugar-acid ratios.

We found that both sucrose and total soluble sugars were significantly negatively correlated with the yellow and green modules, whereas citric acid and organic acids were positively correlated with these two modules. In addition, the brown module showed significant positive and negative correlations with quinic and malic acids, respectively, whereas the red module showed different correlations. The turquoise module showed significant positive correlations only with cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-d-glucoside) and total anthocyanins (Fig. 4 A). Both total anthocyanins and four specific anthocyanin components were highly correlated with the blue and yellow modules. The blue module was positively correlated and enriched for several anthocyanin synthesis-related metabolic pathways, including flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the yellow module was negatively correlated but also enriched for several anthocyanin synthesis-related pathways, as well as photosynthesis-related pathways such as photosynthesis and photosynthesis-antenna proteins (Fig. 4 C)."

Interestingly, all five TFs identified through enrichment analyses were found in the blue module (Table S8), thereby tending to indicate that certain DEGs in the blue module may be key factors contributing to the differential accumulation of anthocyanins in WT and MT. Accordingly, we selected these five TFs as hub genes and aimed to determine their regulatory associations with flavonoid synthesis-related genes in the blue module, among which only CsATHB40 , CsUNE10 , and CsRuby can act as regulatory proteins (Table S9). All of these can mediate self-transcriptional regulation, and CsUNE10 and CsRuby can regulate each other. Moreover, we found that they can also participate in the regulation of the flavonoid synthesis-related genes in the blue module, including CsPAL1 (Cs_ont_6g020620), CsPAL2 (Cs_ont_8g005310), CsAOC (Cs_ont_5g045250), Cs4CL1 (Cs_ont_6g025120), Cs4CL2 (Cs_ont_5g016610), CsCHS (Cs_ont_9g012610), CsCHI (Cs_ont_7g004690), and CsCOMT (Cs_ont_3g008120) (Fig. 4 D)."

The TSS contents of MT were also significantly higher than those of WT. The TSS of MT exceeded 15 °Brix at 190 DAF and then remained between 14.91 and 15.80 °Brix. In contrast, the TSS of WT was only 12.91 °Brix at 190 DAF and gradually increased to 14.81 °Brix at 280 DAF (Table S4). Similarly, the total soluble sugar content of MT between 220 and 265 DAF was significantly higher than those recorded for WT (Fig. S2A). Citric acid was the most abundant among the three assessed organic acids (citric, quinic, and malic acid). In both varieties, the citric acid content gradually increased from 160 to 190 DAF and then declined, and the content in MT was significantly lower than that in WT. Comparatively, there was less variation in the contents of the other two organic acids (Fig. S2B). These differences in sugar and acid contents between MT and WT were reflected in the respective sugar-acid ratios. In both varieties, the sugar-acid ratios gradually increased with fruit maturation, and the ratios in MT were consistently significantly higher than those in WT after 190 DAF (Table S4)."

In this study, we found that the expression of certain genes in the phenylalanine pathway, all genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, and a few genes in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway were significantly higher in WT fruits than in MT fruits.

For example, the red and green stripe traits in apples are due to differences in methylation of the promoter regions of MdMYB10 and MdMYB1, TFs that regulate pericarp anthocyanin synthesis, leading to differences in the expression of these genes in different parts of the pericarp [ 49 , 50 ]. In Citrus , hypomethylation of the promoter of AbRuby2 from oyster shell thorns has been found to promote anthocyanin accumulation in pigmented leaves [ 51 ]. Similarly, the fungus can induce anthocyanin accumulation, and cause hypomethylation in the promoter region of CsRuby [ 52 ]. In the present study, among the 64 genes that were commonly differentially expressed in the three-stage comparison groups, we identified five genes that are associated with methylation i.e., the modification of anthocyanin methylation and the promotion of DNA methylation, thereby providing evidence to indicate that methylation potentially influences anthocyanin accumulation. Furthermore, treatment of MT fruits with 20 mM 5-aza was observed to induce hypomethylation of the promoters and gene bodies of CsC4H and CsPAL, thereby promoting a significant anthocyanin accumulation in the pulp, which is similar to previous finding reported for peach and pear fruits injected with 5-aza at concentrations of 1 and 50 mM, respectively [ 53 , 54 ]. Notably, contrasting findings have been reported for strawberries, where treatment with 1 mM 5-aza inhibited anthocyanin and pigment accumulation in orange callus tissue [ 55 , 56 ].

For example, the red and green stripe traits in apples are due to differences in methylation of the promoter regions of MdMYB10 and MdMYB1, TFs that regulate pericarp anthocyanin synthesis, leading to differences in the expression of these genes in different parts of the pericarp [ 49 , 50 ]. In Citrus , hypomethylation of the promoter of AbRuby2 from oyster shell thorns has been found to promote anthocyanin accumulation in pigmented leaves [ 51 ]. Similarly, the fungus can induce anthocyanin accumulation, and cause hypomethylation in the promoter region of CsRuby [ 52 ]. In the present study, among the 64 genes that were commonly differentially expressed in the three-stage comparison groups, we identified five genes that are associated with methylation i.e., the modification of anthocyanin methylation and the promotion of DNA methylation, thereby providing evidence to indicate that methylation potentially influences anthocyanin accumulation. Furthermore, treatment of MT fruits with 20 mM 5-aza was observed to induce hypomethylation of the promoters and gene bodies of CsC4H and CsPAL, thereby promoting a significant anthocyanin accumulation in the pulp, which is similar to previous finding reported for peach and pear fruits injected with 5-aza at concentrations of 1 and 50 mM, respectively [ 53 , 54 ]. Notably, contrasting findings have been reported for strawberries, where treatment with 1 mM 5-aza inhibited anthocyanin and pigment accumulation in orange callus tissue [ 55 , 56 ]. These findings suggest that as an epigenetic modification, DNA methylation may be subjected to differential regulation, thereby presenting interesting avenues for further research."

MT fruits had high sugar and low acid content, which is more in line with the preferences of East Asian consumers [ 29 ]. In terms of flavonoids, the contents of different types of anthocyanins in MT fruits were significantly lower than those in WT fruits. However, there were no significant differences between the two varieties in other flavonoids (e.g., rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside). Based on the analysis of samples collected at different time points, we established thatMT fruits accumulated soluble sugars more rapidly and reduced organic acids faster, reaching the ripening and harvestable standard between 190 and 205 DAF, whereas WT fruits could not be harvested until between 250 and 280 DAF [ 30 ]."

Therefore, bud-growth materials with differential anthocyanin accumulation are ideal for investigating the mechanisms of anthocyanin synthesis in Citrus [ 35 ]. As in other plants, the anthocyanin synthesis pathway consists of three main stages: the phenylpropanoid pathway; the synthesis of flavanones, flavones, and flavonols; and, finally, the formation of different anthocyanidins via glycosylation [ 36 ]. In this study, we found that the expression of certain genes in the phenylalanine pathway, all genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, and a few genes in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway were significantly higher in WT fruits than in MT fruits. Given that we established that the differences in the expression of a large number of genes during anthocyanin synthesis were not related to changes in the structural genes of a particular step, we hypothesize that these changes may be mediated by certain TFs that play key regulatory roles in this process [ 37 , 38 ]."

    "full_text": "Introduction The synthesis of anthocyanins, recognized as a critical determinant that exerts a profound impact on both the aesthetic and nutritional qualities of fruits, has long occupied a central position in the academic exploration of fruit quality [ 1 ]. Anthocyanins not only serve as an important basis for fruit color formation but also possess a range of valuable health-related benefits, such as enhancing visual acuity, preventing cardiovascular disorders, and reducing blood pressure [ 2 ]. Numerous studies have shown that the anthocyanin contents and color types of fruits are primarily determined by structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, including PAL , C4H , 4CL , CHS , CHI , F3H , ANS , DFR , UFGT , etc [ 3 , 4 ]., together with transcription factors (TFs), in conjunction withthe activity of TFs such as MYBs , bHLHs , WDRs , and BBXs [ 5 , 6 ]. In addition, external environmental factors (including light, temperature, hormones, and fungi), as well as epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation), have been established to influence the levels of anthocyanins accumulated in fruits [ 7 , 8 , 9 – 10 ]. For example, DNA methylation of the promoter region can inhibit the binding of TFs, thereby leading to lighter colored fruits in some varieties [ 11 ]. Conversely, inhibitors of DNA methylation, such as 5-azacytidine (5-aza), can block the action of DNA methyltransferase, thus promoting the regulatory effects of TFs [ 12 ]. Among plants in the genus Citrus , carotenoids and flavonoids tend to be the predominant pigmented substances [ 13 ], and the blood orange ( C. sinensis L. Osbeck) is the only anthocyanin-rich Citrus fruits grown on a large scale [ 14 , 15 ], of which ‘Tarocco’ is the most widely planted blood orange variety in China. Tarocco has been reported to have originated from a spontaneous bud mutation in a Sanguinello orchard during the early 1900s in Siracusa Province, Sicily [ 15 ], and it has been established that the molecular basis of the blood orange pigmentation involves the retrotransposon-mediated transcriptional activation of CsRuby (a MYB-like TF) [ 14 ]. In the ‘Moro’, another blood orange variety, the sequence upstream of this TF has been found to contains the 3ʹ-LTR portion of the TCS1 retrotransposon [ 14 ]. Despite no differences in the coding sequences of Ruby among multiple Tarocco and Sanguinello clones, considerable variations in the degrees of anthocyanin pigmentation were found in the pulp and peel [ 15 ], ranging from a few red vesicles to a deep reddish-purple coloration [ 16 ]. As experimental material in this study, we focused on a bud variety discovered in a Tarocco orchard in Wenzhou city of China, which was characterized by a lack of accumulated anthocyanin in the peel and pulp (Fig. S1A). Unlike Tarocco fruits, which typically display a distinct purplish-red color at maturity and after 30 days of postharvest storage at low temperature, the fruits of this variant remained orange-yellow color (Fig. S1B, C). The two varieties have similar flowering periods. In addition, compared with Tarocco plants, the margins of the bud variant leaves were crinkled (Fig. S1D). Notably, these variant traits were established to be stably inherited in the asexually reproduced plants. The aberrant fruit color trait is an established trait of the original ancestor’s and can thus be cited as an example of revertive inheritance. In contrast, the leaf-crumpling trait is not observed in sweet oranges, suggesting that this trait may have resulted from new genetic variation. In this study, we collected the fruits of C. sinensis cv. Tarocco (WT) and its bud variant C. sinensis cv. Ouya (MT) at different developmental stages to examine trait changes including fruit size and the contents of anthocyanins, soluble sugars, and organic acids. Moreover, we screened the core genes based on RNA-seq analysis to validate their functionality. In addition, we treated MT fruits with 5-aza and analyzed the expression and methylation levels of the core TFs and structural genes based on RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) procedures. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the low anthocyanin content in MT fruits, and also provide support for the promotion of MT as a new variety. Materials and methods Plant material From September 2022 to January 2023, we collected WT and MT fruits, which were cultivated in a Fengwei orchard in Wenzhou city (120.41°E, 28.02°N). Our project team undertook the formal identification of the Ouya, but neither was deposited in a publicly accessible herbarium. Furthermore, plants derived from MT scions high-grafted with WT as the rootstock were found to have a similar fruiting period to the parent variety. The first samples were collected at 160 days after flowering (DAF), when the fruit surfaces of both varieties had begun to fade to green, and thereafter, samples were obtained at 15-day intervals until 280 DAF, during which time, a total of nine samples were collected, each consisting of 10 fruits. Appearance traits Measurement of fruit weights and size Fruit weight was determined using a DLX-A8 digital balance (DELIXI, Wenzhou, China) with an accuracy of 0.01 g. Fruit size (equatorial diameters and length) was measured using a 3.0 V electronic digital slide gauge (DELIXI, Wenzhou, China) with an accuracy of 0.01 mm. Measurement of peel and pulp color parameters The colors of the peel and pulp of fruits were determined using a C-300 colorimeter (Minolta, Osaka, Japan). For the peel, four points were uniformly selected on the equatorial plane of each fruit for testing. For the pulp, four points were uniformly selected on the longitudinal plane of the fruit, 2 cm from the peel. Thereby, the L*, a*, and b* data were obtained using a colorimeter. These values were then used to calculate the hue angle degree (H) and citrus color index (CCI) [ 17 ]. All the above appearance traits assessed 10 WT and MT fruits. After the test, the peel was separated from the pulp. The albedo was removed from the peel, and the segment wall was removed from the pulp. Both the peel and pulp were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Physicochemical determinations Determination of total soluble solid, soluble sugar, organic acid, vitamin C, and total carotenoid contents of fruits The total soluble solids (TSS) content of fruits was measured using a digital total soluble solids refractometer (PAL-1; Atago, Tokyo, Japan). After the pulp was initially ground with liquid nitrogen, the soluble sugar and organic acid contents were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC; soluble sugars: UPLC ACQUITY H-Class, Waters, Milford, USA; organic acids: UltiMate 3000, Thermo, Waltham, USA). Extraction and assay methods were based on the B Yang, H Yao, J Zhang, Y Li, Y Ju, X Zhao, X Sun and Y Fang [ 18 ]. The sugar-acid ratio was calculated as the ratio of total soluble solids to total organic acids. The vitamin C contents in fruit pulp samples were determined by titrating an aqueous extract of the pulp with a solution of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol dye to a faint pink endpoint [ 19 ]. The total carotenoid contents were measured using a plant carotenoid content assay kit (AKPL004M, Boxbio, Beijing, China). Analysis of total anthocyanins and their fractions The pulp and peel samples were ground into a powder, and 100 mg was weighed and extracted with 0.5 mL of a methanol/water/hydrochloric acid (500:500:1, V/V/V). Then the extract was vortex-mixed for 5 min, ultrasonicated for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 ℃ for 3 min. The residue was re-extracted by repeating the above steps under the same conditions. The supernatants were collected and filtered through a membrane filter (0.22 μm). The total anthocyanin content in the samples was measured using the pH differential method as described by J Lee, RW Durst and RE Wrolstad [ 20 ]. Theabsorbances of the sample extracts were measured at 520 and 700 nm using a spectrophotometer (UV-2550; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The contents of anthocyanin fractions ofpulp were determined using MetWare ( http://www.metware.cn/ ) based on an LC-MS/MS platform (QTRAP 6500; AB Sciex, Framingham, USA). Assessments of each of the physicochemical traits were performed using three biological replicates. RNA extraction, library construction, sequencing, and data analysis Total RNA was extracted from the pulp of WT and MT fruits collected at 235, 265, and 280 DAF using an Omini Plant RNA Kit (DNase I, Cwbio, Nanjing, China) and named WT1/MT1, WT2/MT2, and WT3/MT3, respectively. High-throughput sequencing was performed using the Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform (Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology Co., Ltd). To ensure data accuracy, each preparation was analyzed using three biological replicates, resulting in 18 independent RNA samples. Each sequencing library contained 40.8–85.2 million clean reads, alignment with the pomelo reference genome ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/index.php , Citrus sinensis v3.0), genes with a false discovery rate below 0.05 and absolute fold change ≥ 2 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and functional annotation methods are referenced from Y You, C Ju, L Wang, X Wang, F Ma, G Wang and Y Wang [ 21 ]. TFs analysis and prediction of the reference PlantTFDB [ 22 ]. Weighted gene co-expressed network analysis (WGCNA) Co-expression networks were constructed using the weighted gene co-expressed network analysis (WGCNA) package (v1.47) in R. WGCNA was performed using Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology as previously described, with minor modifications [ 23 ]. Briefly, WGCNA includes network construction, module and gene selection, and the functional analysis of module genes. After removing genes with extremely low expression levels from the samples, 9571 genes were imported intoWGCNA with the following parameters: soft threshold was 12, network type was signed, minKMEtoStay was 0.3, mergeCutHeight was 0.45, and minModuleSize was 50. Regulatory network diagrams were constructed using Cytoscape 3.7.1 [ 24 ]. To identify biologically significant modules, module eigengenes were used to calculate correlation coefficients with the sample traits. We used the contents of four highest content anthocyanins, total anthocyanins, soluble sugars (including glucose, fructose, and sucrose), and organic acids (including quinic, malic, and citric acids) as sample traits. cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR cDNA was synthesized from extracted RNA using Hifair II First Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (Yeasen, Shanghai, China). RT-qPCR analyses were performed using three independent biological and three technical replicates in a QuantStudio 6 thermocycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), with relative gene expression being calculated using the 2 −△△Ct method. The primers used for RT-qPCR are listed in Table S1. Transient expression of CsRuby in fruits To compare the sequences of CsRuby in the two varieties, the respective coding sequences of CsRuby were PCR amplified from cDNA libraries prepared from WT and MT newly-grown leaves and cloned using a Hieff Clone ® Plus One Step Cloning Kit (Yeasen, Shanghai, China). To insert the gene into a pBI101 plasmid for overexpression, we conducted recombinase reactions using a Hieff Clone ® Universal II One Step Cloning Kit (Yeasen, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Agrobacterium transformed with the gene constructs was grown overnight in liquid Luria–Bertani medium to an optical density (O.D.) of 0.8–1.0, and diluted to a final O.D. of 0.8 in liquid injection medium containing 0.05 M MES, 2 mM Na 3 PO 4 , 0.5% (m/v) d-glucose, and 0.1 mM acetosyringone. For the assessment of transient expression, we injected both sides of MT fruits’ equatorial plane with either the CsRuby overexpression vector or a control empty vector. 5-Azacytidine treatment and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis To assess the effects of DNA methylation in fruits, we used the methylation inhibitor 5-aza (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) to treat MT fruits collected at 235 DAF. The 5-aza was dissolved in sterile water to a final concentration of 20 mM and passed through 0.22-µm polyethersulfone filters. Aliquots of approximately 1.0 mL were carefully injected into the equatorial plane of fruits using an HPLC syringe with a needle inserted into the fruits to a depth of approximately 0.3–0.5 cm. One half of each fruit was injected with 5-aza, while the other half was injected with sterile water as a control. The 5-aza and sterile water injections were subsequently repeated three to five times at 2-day intervals. After 7 days of treatment, the fruits were cut into two halves using a scalpel, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used for analysis. Samples obtained frompulp on both sides of the fruits were subjected to RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis (WGBS). DNA/RNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing were performed by e-Gene ( www.egenetech.com ). Statistical analysis All data are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD). For each treatment, the mean and SD values were calculated using Microsoft Excel. Subsequently, statistically significant differences between WT and MT samples were determined by a two-tailed Student’s t -test ( P < 0.05). Results Physicochemical properties Between 160 and 235 DAF, the peel of WT fruits was found to be consistently more orange-red in color than that of the MT fruits. In contrast, between 160 and 205 DAF, the pulps of the two varieties were similar in color, and no significant anthocyanin accumulation was observed. It was not until 220 DAF that the color of the MT pulp was significantly paler than that of the WT. At this time,the edges of the WT peel were red. Thereafter, the red coloration in the WT gradually spread to the central axis, and by 280 DAF, it had covered the entire pulp in filaments pattern. In contrast, in the MT, only the edge of the peel remained red (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 The appearance ( A ) and total anthocyanin content in the peel and pulp ( B ) of Tarocco (WT) and its bud variety (MT) at different development stages. Data are mean ± standard error ( n = 3 biologically independent replicates). Asterisks indicate significant differences: ∗ P < 0.05 The color characteristics of the peeland pulp of the two varieties are shown in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. Specifically, between 160 and 235 DAF, the L* values of MT peel were significantly lower than those of the WT peel. However, no significant differences were detected between the MT and WT peels from 250 to 280 DAF, nor were there significant differences in the pulp throughout all the assessed stages. As the fruits of both varieties continued to ripen, the a* values of the peel and pulp gradually increased. Nevertheless, the a* values in the MT pulp were consistently and significantly lower than those in the WT pulp, and significant differences in the a* values of the peels were observed after 205 DAF. At all stages, the CCI values of the MT peel were significantly lower than those of the WT peel. Specifically, at 280 DAF, the CCI values were 3.69 for the WT peel (characterized by an orange - red appearance) and 2.46 for the MT peel (with an orange appearance). At this time, the CCIs of MT and WT were −1.68 and 1.12, respectively. In contrast to the trends of a*, b*, and CCI, notable differences were observed in the trends of H values. Throughout all sampling stages, the H values recorded for the MT pulp and peel were significantly higher than those for the WT. Comparisons of the changes in fruit weight, size, TSS, soluble sugar, and organic acid contents in the pulp of WT and MT fruits at different stages revealed that the equatorial diameter of MT fruits was significantly greater than that of WT fruits, resulting in higher fruit weights of MT (254.08 g) compared with those of WT (242.36 g) at 280 DAF (Table S4). The TSS contents of MT were also significantly higher than those of WT. The TSS of MT exceeded 15 °Brix at 190 DAF and then remained between 14.91 and 15.80 °Brix. In contrast, the TSS of WT was only 12.91 °Brix at 190 DAF and gradually increased to 14.81 °Brix at 280 DAF (Table S4). Similarly, the total soluble sugar content of MT between 220 and 265 DAF was significantly higher than those recorded for WT (Fig. S2A). Citric acid was the most abundant among the three assessed organic acids (citric, quinic, and malic acid). In both varieties, the citric acid content gradually increased from 160 to 190 DAF and then declined, and the content in MT was significantly lower than that in WT. Comparatively, there was less variation in the contents of the other two organic acids (Fig. S2B). These differences in sugar and acid contents between MT and WT were reflected in the respective sugar-acid ratios. In both varieties, the sugar-acid ratios gradually increased with fruit maturation, and the ratios in MT were consistently significantly higher than those in WT after 190 DAF (Table S4). In addition, we examined the contents of vitamin C and total carotenoids in the pulp at 280 DAF. The vitamin C contents were 53.70 and 51.01 mg·100 g −1 in WT and MT, respectively, with no significant difference (Fig. S2C). Compared with MT, the carotenoid levels in WT were significantly higher, with values of 48.28 and 59.62 µg·g −1 , respectively (Fig. S2D). Changes in the contents of total anthocyanins and their fractions The changes in the contents of total anthocyanins in the peel and pulp of the two varieties were observed to follow trends similar to those of the change in fruit appearance, with no anthocyanins being detected until 220 DAF. As the fruits gradually matured, the contents of total anthocyanins in the pulp tended to remain relatively low, and no significant differences were detected at 220 and 235 DAF. However, compared with MT fruits, significantly higher levels of total anthocyanins were detected in the peel of WT fruits. From 250 to 280 DAF, the total anthocyanins in both the pulp and peel were significantly higher in WT than in MT (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, we also analyzed the flavonoid fractions in pulp samples collected at 235, 265, and 280 DAF (Fig. 2 A), and accordingly detected a total of 38 anthocyanins and 6 flavanones, with the contents of cyanidin-like anthocyanins being relatively high, among which cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-d-glucoside) and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside had the highest relative contents. The levels of both these anthocyanins gradually increased with fruit maturation, with significantly higher levels being detected in WT (53.68 and 9.96 µg·g −1 , respectively) than in MT (27.14 and 6.61 µg·g −1 , respectively) when measured at 289 DAF. Rutin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, and quercetin-3-O-glucoside were identified as the flavonoids with higher relative contents. At 280 DAF, their levels were again found to be significantly higher in WT (22.2, 12.64, and 8.26 µg·g −1 , respectively) than in MT (15.04, 9.76, and 3.42 µg·g −1 , respectively) (Table 1 , Table S5).

The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences determined by the Student’s t -test, P < 0.05 A comparison of the number of anthocyanins and flavonoids among the different groups revealed four differential metabolites between the WT and MT fruits at 235 DAF, with the number reaching 7 and 19 at 265 and 280 DAF, respectively, of which only the difference in cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-d-glucoside) was significant at all assessed time points (Fig. 2 B). Among the differential metabolites detected in the same variety at 265 and 280 DAF compared with 235 DAF, a majority (11 and 9 metabolites) were commonly differentially synthesized in WT and MT, respectively (Fig. 2 C, D). RNA-seq of WT and MT fruits during different developmental stages To investigate the mechanisms associated with the differential synthesis of anthocyanins in WT and MT at the gene expression level, we also conducted RNA-seq analysis of samples in which anthocyanin fractions were detected. An overview of the transcriptome data (including quality check information) is shown in Table S6. Correlations analysis between samples demonstrated good reproducibility among the three biological replicates, with the least variability between WT1 and WT2, while relatively large differences among WT1, MT3, MT1, and WT3 (Fig. S3A). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the WT and MT groups at the three time points was performed to examine the variation in data across different groups. The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 27.80% of the observed variance, suggesting that gene expression profiles were influenced by the degree of fruit development. In contrast, the second principal component (PC2) accounted for only 15.37% of the variance (Fig. S3B). Interestingly, there was less variability between WT and MT in the subsequent stage (i.e., WT1 vs. MT2 and WT2 vs. MT3). In addition to the 49,567 annotated genes in the reference genome, we discovered 1,695 previously unidentified genes (see Table S7 for detailed information). Three comparison groups (WT1 vs. MT1, WT2 vs. MT2, and WT3 vs. MT3) were established for the two varieties at different time points (Fig. S3C). A total of 321 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (207 up-regulated and 114 down-regulated) were identified at 235 DAF, whereas 734 (617 up-regulated and 117 down-regulated) and 816 (507 up-regulated and 309 down-regulated) DEGs were identified at 265 and 280 DAF, respectively. This indicates that the number of DEGs between the two varieties gradually increased with fruit maturation. Details of the expression levels and statistical data for TFs in the DEGs are presented in Table S8. Notably, five common TFs detected in WT and MT, namely Cs_ont_1g026270 ( CsATHB40 ), Cs_ont_1g027600 ( CsBBX18 ), Cs_ont_3g011170 ( CsLBD1 ), Cs_ont_5g001230 ( CsUNE10 ), and Cs_ont_6g005110 ( CsRuby ), showed significant differences in expression throughout all the assessed stages. This suggests that these TFs may be involved in regulating the differential accumulation of flavonoids in the fruits of the two varieties. Among these, CsBBX18 , CsUNE10 , and CsRuby are B-box, bHLH, and MYB class TFs, respectively, which may be associated with flavonoid biosynthesis. KEGG and GO enrichment analysis of DEGs Enrichment analysis of the DEGs obtained from the three comparison groups was conducted with reference to the KEGG and GO databases. For all three comparison groups, KEGG analysis revealed an enrichment of DEGs in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. As the fruit matured, both the upstream and downstream pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis were concurrently enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as the biosynthesis of flavonoids and flavonols (Fig. 3 A-C). Fig. 3 Identification and functional characterization of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Tarocco (WT) and its bud variety (MT) pulp samples.

For the WT2 vs. MT2 comparison, DEGs were found to be enriched in pathways associated with cellular transporters, such as ABC transporters and secondary active transmembrane transporter activity. In the case of the WT3 vs. MT3 comparison, GO analysis revealed enrichment in the categories associated with anthocyanin synthesis, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity and flavonoid biosynthesis (Fig. S4A-C). To identify specific genes associated with WT and MT at different time points, we constructed Venn diagrams for the DEGs. As shown in Fig. 3 D, we identified 64 DEGs common to the three groups, suggesting that these core conserved genes may be associated with the developmental traits of both varieties. Subsequently, we carried out KEGG and GO enrichment analysis on these 64 DEGs, with the former revealing an enrichment of flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis pathways (Fig. 3 E), and the latter indicating enrichment of five methylation-related DEGs. All of these DEGs were found to be more highly expressed in WT than in MT (Fig. S4D). Identification of WGCNA modules associated with anthocyanin and fruit quality traits To ensure the accuracy of network construction, we initially removed genes with extremely low expression levels in all samples (for details, see the Materials and Methods). A gene clustering tree was constructed by consideration the correlations between gene expression levels. Gene modules were established based on clustering relationships; that is, genes with similar expression patterns were grouped into the same module. The modules were generated by cutting off branches from the dendrogram. Finally, similar modules were merged to obtain seven modules, as shown in Fig. S5A-C, which were clustered into three main branches (three, two, and two modules, respectively; Fig. S5D). Genes associated with anthocyanin synthesis can be better categorized based on WGCNA. We found that both sucrose and total soluble sugars were significantly negatively correlated with the yellow and green modules, whereas citric acid and organic acids were positively correlated with these two modules. In addition, the brown module showed significant positive and negative correlations with quinic and malic acids, respectively, while the red module exhibited different correlation patterns. The turquoise module showed significant positive correlations only with cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-d-glucoside) and total anthocyanins (Fig. 4 A). Both total anthocyanins and four specific anthocyanin components were highly correlated with the blue and yellow modules. The blue module was positively correlated and enriched for several anthocyanin synthesis-related metabolic pathways, including flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism (Fig. 4 B), whereas the latter was negatively correlated, it was also enriched for several anthocyanin synthesis-related pathways, as well as photosynthesis-related pathways such as photosynthesis and photosynthesis-antenna proteins (Fig. 4 C).

( A ) The left panel shows the 7 modules and the number of genes in each module. Color indicates the correlation coefficient of a specific module and the treatment, as shown in the right.

We found that both sucrose and total soluble sugars were significantly negatively correlated with the yellow and green modules, whereas citric acid and organic acids were positively correlated with these two modules. In addition, the brown module showed significant positive and negative correlations with quinic and malic acids, respectively, whereas the red module showed different correlations. The turquoise module showed significant positive correlations only with cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-d-glucoside) and total anthocyanins (Fig. 4 A). Both total anthocyanins and four specific anthocyanin components were highly correlated with the blue and yellow modules. The blue module was positively correlated and enriched for several anthocyanin synthesis-related metabolic pathways, including flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the yellow module was negatively correlated but also enriched for several anthocyanin synthesis-related pathways, as well as photosynthesis-related pathways such as photosynthesis and photosynthesis-antenna proteins (Fig. 4 C). All TFs found to show a differential expression between the WT and MT were categorized into different modules, with blue having a progressively higher number of differentially expressed TFs in the three stages (12, 15, and 33, respectively), while the total numbers and differences in the yellow module were smaller (2, 0, and 2, respectively). Interestingly, all five TFs identified through enrichment analyses were found in the blue module (Table S8), thereby tending to indicate that certain DEGs in the blue module may be key factors contributing to the differential accumulation of anthocyanins in WT and MT. Accordingly, we selected these five TFs as hub genes and aimed to determine their regulatory associations with flavonoid synthesis-related genes in the blue module, among which only CsATHB40 , CsUNE10 , and CsRuby can act as regulatory proteins (Table S9). All of these can mediate self-transcriptional regulation, and CsUNE10 and CsRuby can regulate each other. Moreover, we found that they can also participate in the regulation of the flavonoid synthesis-related genes in the blue module, including CsPAL1 (Cs_ont_6g020620), CsPAL2 (Cs_ont_8g005310), CsAOC (Cs_ont_5g045250), Cs4CL1 (Cs_ont_6g025120), Cs4CL2 (Cs_ont_5g016610), CsCHS (Cs_ont_9g012610), CsCHI (Cs_ont_7g004690), and CsCOMT (Cs_ont_3g008120) (Fig. 4 D). Combined transcriptomic and flavonoid analysis Among the MBW complexes comprising important TFs that regulate anthocyanin synthesis, we found that only the expression levels of CsRuby showed a trend similar to that of total anthocyanin content. In all three stages, the expression of CsRuby in WT fruits was significantly higher than that in MT fruits, and its expression gradually increased with fruit maturation. In contrast, the expression pattern of CsTTG1 (a WD40 TF) was opposed to that of CsRuby . The expression of CsAN1 (a bHLH TF) and another CsWD40 was significantly higher in MT than in WT at 265 DAF, but diametrically opposite at 280 DAF (Fig. S6). Among the structural genes, with the exception of CsPAL (Cs_ont_7g006400, Cs_ont_8g005310, and Cs_ont_6g020620) and Cs4CL (Cs_ont_5g016610 and Cs_ont_6g025120), none of those in the phenylpropanoid pathway were significantly up-regulated in MT compared with WT. Comparatively, all genes of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (including CsCHS , CsCHI , CsF3H , CsF3’H , CsF3’5’H , CsDFR , CsANS , and CsBZ1 ) showed significantly lower expression in MT than in WT. Furthermore, among the genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (including Cs3MaT1 , Cs3GGT , and CsUDPG ), only Cs3MaT1 (Cs_ont_2g020750) and CsUDPG (Cs_ont_2g015530 and Cs_ont_2g022650) exhibited a trend similar to that of genes associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, whereas other genes showed no significant differences between the two varieties (Fig. S6). Collectively, these findings provide evidence to indicate that in WT, CsRuby enhances the anthocyanin content in fruits by regulating the expression of gene associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, whereas this process appears to be suppressed in MT. To assess whether the expressed transcripts were correctly quantified, we analyzed 11 transcripts (three TFs and eight structural genes associated with flavonoid synthesis), and accordingly found that the relative expression and TPM of each gene was significantly correlated (Fig. S7), thereby confirming the results of RNA-seq analysis. Functional validation of CsRuby The coding sequences of CsRuby from MT and WT were cloned and compared with those of the Navel (JN402329), Moro (JN402330.1), and Jingxian (JN402333) varieties, all of which are registered in the NCBI database and are identical (Fig. S8A). In addition, the coding sequence of CsRuby cloned from MT and overexpressed in MT pulp, it significantly promoted the accumulation of anthocyanins and the expression of related synthetic genes in the pulp (Fig. S8B-E). Changes in gene expression and DNA methylation in response to 5-aza treatment After treatment with 5-aza, a significant accumulation of anthocyanin was detected in the pulp of MT fruits (Fig. 5 A, B). By comparing the RNA-seq of the CK and 5-aza treated samples, a total of 1657 DEGs were identified between the two treatments. Among them, 661 and 996 were up- and down-regulated, respectively (Fig. 5 C). KEGG enrichment analysis of these DEGs revealed an enrichment of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis, two pathways associated with anthocyanin synthesis (Fig. 5 D). However, the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was enriched with both up- and down-regulated genes, the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway was enriched only with down-regulated genes, as was the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway (Fig. S9A, B). In addition, GO enrichment analysis revealed that the categories of categories chitin and external encapsulating structure synthesis were enriched with up-and down-regulated genes, respectively (Fig. S9C, D). Furthermore, the levels of CsPAL , CsC4H , Cs4CL , CsCHS , CsF3H , CsF3’5’H , CsF3’H , CsDFR , and CsANS , along with numerous other structural genes associated with anthocyanin synthesis, as well as TFs such as CsWD40 and CsAN1 , were significantly higher after 5-aza treatment. Nevertheless, no significant changes in the expression of CsRuby were detected in response to this treatment (Fig. 5 E). Fig. 5 Changes in the anthocyanin content, gene expression, and methylation levels based on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis in bud variety (MT) after 5-aza treatment.

H , visualization of the methylation levels in the anthocyanin-related genes (including CsCHI , CsUDPG , CsC4H , Cs4CL , and CsPAL ) promoter and gene body region. Hyper, hypermethylated; Hypo, hypomethylated We performed WGBS for the 5-aza treatment and CK groups and obtained > 50.93 million clean reads (6.63 Gb) from each sample, among which at least 77.00% mapped to the reference genome (Table S10). A comparison of the DNA methylation dynamics patterns between the CK and 5-aza treatment samples showed that the proportions of CG and CHG methylation were higher in the CK group, at 12.94% and 15.52%, respectively, whereas that the proportions of CHH methylation were relatively higher in the 5-aza treated group, at 73.15% (Fig. S10A). Furthermore, in all CG, CHG, and CHH methylation contexts, reductions in DNA methylation were detected within the 5ʹ and 3ʹ regions (in the upstream or downstream 2 K sequences) of genes in the 5-aza treated samples compared with the CK samples, especially in the case of CHG and CHH methylation (Fig. 5 F, S10B-D). Analysis of the differentially methylated regions (DMR) between the CK and 5-aza groups revealed a higher number of hyper-DMRs compared with hypo-DMRs in all contexts of CG, CHG, and CHH, with the most pronounced effects detected in promoters and exons (Fig. 5 G). KEGG analysis of DMRs indicated an enrichment of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts (Fig. S11). In this case, the promoters of CsCHI, CsUDPG, CsC4H, and CsPAL were characterized by a reduction in CHH methylation levels following 5-aza treatment, and similar reductions were detected in the gene body regions of CsC4H, Cs4CL, and CsPAL (Fig. 5 H). In addition, three and one differentially methylated cytosines were identified in the introns and exons of CsRuby, respectively (Fig. S12). Discussion Differences in the traits of MT and WT fruits Currently, numerous new citrus varietiesare derived from natural mutation [ 25 ], and a majority of the citrus varieties validated, registered, and granted plant variety rights in China are selected by bud mutation (i.e., somatic variation) [ 26 ]. However, in most cases, somatic variations result in new traits that may not be superior to those of the original varieties; moreover, some of these traits may not be apparent after subsequent grafting [ 27 , 28 ]. Consequently, in this study, we performed high grafting of the MT and WT varieties, and accordingly found that the resulting plants of two varieties still showed significant differences in appearance and fruit quality. In terms of fruit quality traits, MT was superior to WT in terms of fruit weight, size, and the contents of soluble sugars and organic acids. MT fruits had high sugar and low acid content, which is more in line with the preferences of East Asian consumers [ 29 ]. In terms of flavonoids, the contents of different types of anthocyanins in MT fruits were significantly lower than those in WT fruits. However, there were no significant differences between the two varieties in other flavonoids (e.g., rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside). Based on the analysis of samples collected at different time points, we established thatMT fruits accumulated soluble sugars more rapidly and reduced organic acids faster, reaching the ripening and harvestable standard between 190 and 205 DAF, whereas WT fruits could not be harvested until between 250 and 280 DAF [ 30 ]. In this regard, whereas numerous studies have demonstrated that high-sugar and high-acid fruit environments are more conducive to anthocyanin accumulation [ 31 , 32 – 33 ], we found that in MT fruits, which have relatively high sugar and low acid contents, anthocyanins accumulate at a slower rates in both the peel and pulp compared with WT fruits. Accordingly, we postulate that the suppression of anthocyanin accumulation in MT is due to the inhibition of a “switch” that regulates anthocyanins. Furthermore, the lower pulp pH may also affect anthocyanin synthesis. However, the effects of these factors need further investigation. Compared with the WT fruits, MT also had significantly lower levels of total carotenoids, whereas we observed no significant differences between the two varieties in the content of vitamin C, the most representative nutrient in blood oranges [ 16 ]. Based on these findings, we identified MT as a new low-anthocyanin blood orange variety that can ripen up to 1 month earlier than the Tarocco variety traditionally cultivated in Wenzhou City. Moreover, the MT variety produces larger fruits with a more favorable sugar–acid ratio, and thus could contribute to the promotion of blood orange production in China. Effects of the hypothetical “switch” on the synthesis of anthocyanins Among Citrus fruits, blood oranges are among the few varieties of orange that accumulate comparatively large amounts of anthocyanins in ripe fruits [ 15 , 34 ]. Therefore, bud-growth materials with differential anthocyanin accumulation are ideal for investigating the mechanisms of anthocyanin synthesis in Citrus [ 35 ]. As in other plants, the anthocyanin synthesis pathway consists of three main stages: the phenylpropanoid pathway; the synthesis of flavanones, flavones, and flavonols; and, finally, the formation of different anthocyanidins via glycosylation [ 36 ]. In this study, we found that the expression of certain genes in the phenylalanine pathway, all genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, and a few genes in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway were significantly higher in WT fruits than in MT fruits. Given that we established that the differences in the expression of a large number of genes during anthocyanin synthesis were not related to changes in the structural genes of a particular step, we hypothesize that these changes may be mediated by certain TFs that play key regulatory roles in this process [ 37 , 38 ]. The findings of previous studies have indicated that MYB TFs, as well as other TFs such as BBX , may play key regulatory roles in anthocyanin synthesis [ 5 , 39 ]. Accordingly, we examined the activity of five selected TFs at all three assessed stages of fruit maturation. Notably, it has been established that the promoter of CsRuby contains a copia-like retrotransposon insertion that enables it to regulate blood orange anthocyanin production [ 34 ]. We detected no differences in the coding sequences of CsRuby in MT and WT, in which it can promote anthocyanin synthesis. However, whether these are differences in the promoter or other regions of this gene between the two varieties needs further investigation. Among the other TFs assessed, CsTTG1 and CsWD40 (WD40), and CsAN1 (bHLH), which can form MBW complexes with CsRuby, have been shown to be jointly involved in the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis in plants [ 40 , 41 ]. However, in citrus , members of this complex also interacts with each other [ 42 ], and CgAN1 can synergistically interact with CgRuby to promote anthocyanin accumulation [ 31 ], although the functions of the homologous CsTTG1 and CsAN1 proteins in anthocyanin synthesis remain unclear [ 32 , 43 ]. In the present study, we found that neither of these proteins had a positive effect on anthocyanin synthesis. That is, for most of the assessed stage, there were no significant differences in the expression of these TFs between the two varieties. BBX18 has been established to regulate thermoresponsive growth via the PRR5-PIF4 pathway, in which PIF4 inhibits anthocyanin synthesis [ 44 ]. The sequence of UNE10, a member of the PIF family, contains a domain similar to that of PIF4 [ 45 ], and whether it is involved in the regulation of BBX18, and thus affects anthocyanin accumulation is an interesting direction for future research. In addition, LBD proteins have been demonstrated to regulate anthocyanin and nitrogen metabolism, and respond to phytohormones and environmental stimuli during organ boundary formation [ 46 ], among which ATHB has been established to play pivotal roles in regulating the responses to abiotic stress [ 47 ]. Accordingly, it is conceivable that these TFs may also function as key factors that influence anthocyanin synthesis in MT. DNA methylation influences the synthesis of anthocyanin DNA methylation has been shown to play important regulatory roles in fruit development and color formation by modulating the expression of relevant genes [ 48 ]. For example, the red and green stripe traits in apples are due to differences in methylation of the promoter regions of MdMYB10 and MdMYB1, TFs that regulate pericarp anthocyanin synthesis, leading to differences in the expression of these genes in different parts of the pericarp [ 49 , 50 ]. In Citrus , hypomethylation of the promoter of AbRuby2 from oyster shell thorns has been found to promote anthocyanin accumulation in pigmented leaves [ 51 ]. Similarly, the fungus can induce anthocyanin accumulation, and cause hypomethylation in the promoter region of CsRuby [ 52 ]. In the present study, among the 64 genes that were commonly differentially expressed in the three-stage comparison groups, we identified five genes that are associated with methylation i.e., the modification of anthocyanin methylation and the promotion of DNA methylation, thereby providing evidence to indicate that methylation potentially influences anthocyanin accumulation. Furthermore, treatment of MT fruits with 20 mM 5-aza was observed to induce hypomethylation of the promoters and gene bodies of CsC4H and CsPAL, thereby promoting a significant anthocyanin accumulation in the pulp, which is similar to previous finding reported for peach and pear fruits injected with 5-aza at concentrations of 1 and 50 mM, respectively [ 53 , 54 ]. Notably, contrasting findings have been reported for strawberries, where treatment with 1 mM 5-aza inhibited anthocyanin and pigment accumulation in orange callus tissue [ 55 , 56 ]. These findings suggest that as an epigenetic modification, DNA methylation may be subjected to differential regulation, thereby presenting interesting avenues for further research. In summary, by comparing the fruits of two different blood orange varieties at different development stages, we identified MT as a new variety with less pronounced anthocyanin synthesis, but a more favorable sugar–acid ratio than the WT Tarocco variety. We also identified structural genes associated with anthocyanin synthesis, TFs, and methylation-related genes that we assume are involved in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, by treating MT with 5-aza, we found that the promoters and gene bodies of certain anthocyanin synthesis-related genes showed hypomethylation, and that treated fruit accumulated anthocyanin in the pulp. We accordingly speculate that DNA methylation may play an important role in anthocyanin accumulation in MT. Our findings in this study will provide a valuable basis for further research on the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in citrus fruits (Fig. 6 ).

The inhibition of the expression of CsRuby, a key transcription factor in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway, led to the inhibition of the expression of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. This led to the suppression of the expression of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, which ultimately led to the suppression of the synthesis and accumulation of major anthocyanins in the Tarocco fruit.
