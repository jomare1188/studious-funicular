    "full_text": "The host-selective ACT toxin is essential for the pathogenesis of the citrus fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata . However, the mechanism of ACT-toxin gene clusters ACT-toxin biosynthesis regulated by is still poorly understood. The biosynthesis of ACT toxin is mainly regulated by multiple ACT toxin genes located in the secondary metabolite gene cluster. In this study, we reported a transcription regulator ACTR contributes ACT toxin biosynthesis through mediating ACT toxin synthesis gene ACTS4 in Alternaria alternata. We generated ACTR -disrupted and -silenced mutants in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata. Phenotype analysis showed that the ACTR mutants displayed a significant loss of ACT toxin production and a decreased virulence on citrus leaves whereas the vegetative growth and sporulation were not affected, indicating an essential role of ACTR in both ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity. To elucidate the transcription network of ACTR, we performed RNA-Seq experiments on wild-type and ACTR null mutant and identified genes that were differentially expressed between two genotypes. Transcriptome profiling and RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the ACT toxin biosynthetic gene ACTS4 is down-regulated in ACTR mutant. We generated ACTS4 knock-down mutant and found that the pathogenicity of ACTS4 mutant was severely impaired. Interestingly, both ACTR and ACTS4 are not involved in the response to different abiotic stresses including oxidative stress, salt stress, cell-wall disrupting regents, and metal ion stress, indicating the function of these two genes is highly specific. In conclusion, our results highlight the important regulatory role of ACTR in ACT toxin biosynthesis through mediating ACT toxin synthesis gene ACTS4 and underline the essential role of in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata ."

          "The ascomycete fungi belonging to the Alternaria genus contain more than 400 species that are extensively found in air, soil or decaying plant tissues. Most Alternaria species are common saprophytes that derive energy through cellulose decomposition activities, and are found in a variety of habitats as ubiquitous decay agents. However, some Alternaria species have acquired the ability to cause disease over a broad host range. For instance, Alternaria alternata consists of at least seven pathotypes, each of which produces a specific host-selective toxin (HST) with a unique chemical structure, which is only toxic to susceptible host plants ( Tsuge et al., 2013 ; Meena and Samal, 2019 ). A. alternata producing AK-toxin, AM-toxin, AF-toxin, AL-toxin and AT-toxin show virulence specifically to the Japanese pear, apple, strawberry, tomato and tobacco, respectively ( Tsuge et al., 2013 ). In the citrus plant, two A. alternata pathotypes have been found, including rough lemon and tangerine pathotypes. The rough lemon pathotype mostly infects Rough Lemon ( Citrus jambhiri Lush) and Limeng ( C. limonia Osbeck), and lead to rough lemon leaf spot via the production of ACRL (Alternaria citri Rough Lemon) ( Izumi et al., 2012 ). The A. alternata tangerine pathotype produces ACT (Alternaria citri Tangerine) toxin, which is specifically toxic to tangerine ( Citrus reticulata Blanco), grapefruit ( C. paradisi Macfad.), and their hybrids, causing Alternaria brown spots (ABS) of citrus ( Miyamoto et al., 2009 ).",
          "In the infection process of citrus brown spot pathogen, ACT toxin occupies an absolutely important position, which can cause the rupture of citrus cell plasma membrane and cause rapid electrolyte leakage ( Tsuge et al., 2013 ; Meena and Samal, 2019 ). Previous studies have revealed that ACT toxin at a concentration of 2 × 10 −8 M causes necrosis lesions on citrus leaves with a rapid loss of electrolytes from host cells, which is essential for the full virulence of A. alternata tangerine pathotype ( Kohmoto et al., 1993 ; Meena and Samal, 2019 ). Interestingly, ACT toxin, AK-toxin and AF-toxin share a common chemical structure, which is called 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-tridecenoic acid (EDA). The chemical structure of ACT toxin consists of three parts: EDA, valine and polyketide. The ACT toxin mainly includes ACT toxin I and ACT toxin II, of which ACT I is the main component ( Kohmoto et al., 1993 ).",
          "The biosynthesis of ACT toxin is regulated by multiple genes of ACT toxin gene cluster in the conditionally dispensable chromosome (CDC) ( Wang et al., 2019 ). Until now, more than seven genes have been reported to be required for the biosynthesis of ACT toxin, including ACTT1 , ACTT2 , ACTT3 , ACTT5 , ACTT6 , ACTTS2 and ACTTS3 ( Masunaka et al., 2000 , 2005 ; Miyamoto et al., 2008 ; Tsuge et al., 2013 ). Among them, ACTT1, ACTT2 are considered as the homologous genes of AKT1, AKT2 in the Japanese Pear pathotype, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of the decatrienoic acid moiety in the tangerine pathotype ( Miyamoto et al., 2008 ). ACTT5 and ACTT6 encode acetyl-CoA synthetase and enoyl-CoA hydratase, respectively, and the corresponding homologous genes also exist in the Japanese Pear pathotype ( Miyamoto et al., 2009 ). Interestingly, there are two genes, including ACTTS2 (encoding enoyl reductase) and ACTTS3 (encoding peptide synthetase), that are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ACT toxin ( Ajiro et al., 2010 ; Miyamoto et al., 2010 ). In addition, current studies mainly focus on genes directly involved in the biosynthesis of ACT toxin, and the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of these genes are still poorly understood.",
          "In the present study, a homolog of the Zn2Cys6 transcription factor ACTR in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata was identified and functionally characterized to further understand the regulation of host-selective toxin biosynthesis and its significance in pathogenesis. The comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type and ACTR mutant were performed to provide novel data for ACTR-mediated host-selective toxin biosynthesis in A. alternata tangerine pathotype. The ACTR mutation perturbs the expression of a large number of secondary metabolite (SM) genes, including these genes related to the ACT toxin biosynthesis pathway. Our results underline the important regulatory role of ACTR in ACT toxin biosynthesis through mediating ACT toxin synthesis gene ACTS4, and expanded our understanding of the essential role of ACT toxin biosynthesis in the pathogenesis of necrotrophic fungus A. alternata ."

For ACTR -silencing mutant construction, two ACTR fragments (509 bp) were amplified with primer set ACTR-pLF/ACTR-pLR and ACTR-pRF/ACTR-pRR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were inserted into the pSilent-1 plasmid carrying a hygromycin-resistance gene as previously described ( Nunes and Dean, 2012 ). For ACTS4 -silencing mutant construction, two ACTS4 fragments (461 bp) were amplified with primer set ACTS4-pLF/ACTS4-pLR and ACTS4-pRF/ACTS4-pRR by PCR and were inserted into the pSilent-1 plasmid carrying a hygromycin-resistance gene. For ACTR disruption, the upstream and downstream flanking regions of the ACTR gene were amplified with the primer pairs ACTR-pro1F/M14R::ACTR and M14F::ACTR/ACTR-tail, respectively, and were fused with a partial hygromycin gene (HY/g and h/YG) by fusion PCR to generate two DNA fragments (5′ACTR::HY/g and h/YG::3′ACTR) overlapping the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (HYG). The resultant plasmid or DNA fragments were transformed into protoplasts of A. alternata wild-type using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and CaCl 2 as previously described ( Fu et al., 2020 ). Transformants growing on a regeneration medium amended with 100 μg/mL hygromycin were selected, examined by PCR with specific primer pairs upstream and downstream primers.

Raw RNA-Seq reads were processed to remove adaptors and low-quality bases using Trimmomatic v0.36 ( Bolger et al., 2014 ). The cleaned reads were mapped to the A. alternata Z7 using HISAT2 version 2.1.0 ( Kim et al., 2015 ). The number of reads mapped to each gene was counted by HTSeq ( Anders et al., 2015 ) and the resulting transcript count tables were subjected to R DESeq package with a preset FDR ≤ 0.05 and Log2FC ≥ 2 for differential expression analysis ( Love et al., 2014 ). Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and functional term mapping were performed using Blast2GO software ( Conesa et al., 2005 ).

In the present work, we identified an AKTR homolog in the whole genome of Z7, and thus we designated this gene ACTR (GenBank accession no. MW311077, also known as ACTTR ). Protein domain analysis showed that ACTR contained a Zn2Cys6 DNA binding site (Interpro Accession no. IPR001138). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the GO terms of ACTR belong to “regulation of transcription, DNA-templated (GO:0006355)”, “DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (GO:0000981)” and “zinc ion binding (GO:0008270)”.

KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up-regulated genes revealed that the inactivation of ACTR extensively affects gene expression in several metabolic pathways, including “Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis”,” Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum”,” Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism”,” Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism”,” Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)” ( Fig. 4 C, Supplementary Table S4). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of down-regulated genes showed that the inactivation of ACTR widely influences the “Arginine and proline metabolism”,” Starch and sucrose metabolism”,” Tyrosine metabolism”,” Tryptophan metabolism” ( Fig. 4 D, Supplementary Table S5).",

              "To explore the relationship of secondary metabolites (SM) and pathogenicity mediated by ACTR , we examined the transcription response of 30 SM gene clusters in A. alternata predicted by antiSMASH 5.0 (Supplementary Table S6). In general, ACTR showed a broad regulation of SM gene clusters ( Fig. 6 A). The transcript level of cluster1 NRPS, cluster5 T1PKS (Alternapyrone), cluster6 NRPS (Dimethylcoprogen), cluster7 T1PKS, cluster18 NRPS, cluster29 NRPS (ACT-Toxin), cluster19 NRPS_like (Phomopsins) were strongly affected in ACTR -disrupted mutants, indicating that ACTR has an extensive regulatory effect on these gene clusters. The ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster located in CDC 1 is essential for ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity. Interestingly, transcriptome profiles showed that the transcript level of AALT_g11744 (putative membrane protein gene), AALT_g11751 (ACTT5, acyl-synthetase gene), AALT_g11752, and AALT_g11753 were significantly up-regulated while the transcript level of AALT_g11749 ( ACTS4 , non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene) were down-regulated in ⊿ ACTR compared to the wild-type ( Fig. 6 A).",
              "The expression profiles of 14 genes located in the ACT toxin gene cluster were validated by RT-qPCR. The expression of three genes (AALT_g11744, AALT_g11751, and AALT_g11753) were up-regulated and ACTS4 (AALT_g11749) were down-regulated in ⊿ ACTR , which was consistent with the results of RNA-Seq ( Fig. 6 B). RT-qPCR analysis also revealed that the expression of AALT_g11742 (CENP-B protein), AALT_g11743 (ACTT2), AALT_g11746 (Tfo1 transposase), AALT_g11750 (polyketide synthase ACTTS3), AALT_g11756 (c6 zinc finger-like protein), AALT_g11757 (polyketide synthase ACT16), and AALT_g11758 (ACT11) were up-regulated in ⊿ ACTR mutant. Transcriptome and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the inactivation of ACTR gene broadly affects the expression of many genes of SM gene clusters. In particular, ACTR disruption caused a significant down-regulation of ACTS4 gene located in the ACT toxin gene cluster ( Fig. 6 A and B). These results indicate that ACTR may play an important role in ACT toxin biosynthesis through mediating ACT toxin synthesis gene ACTS4 ."

Given that the transcription of ACTS4 is positively regulated by ACTR and crushed citrus leaves treatment, we speculated that ACTR regulates ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity of A. alternata via the transcriptional regulation of ACTS4 . To test this hypothesis, we obtained ACTS4 knock-down transformants (D- ACTS4 ) and performed a phenotypic analysis of D- ACTS4 . Similar to ΔACTR , virulence assays performed on detached citrus leaves revealed that D- ACTS4 failed to induce visible necrotic lesions 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) indicating that ACTS4 is essential for the pathogenicity of A. alternata ( Fig. 7 C)."

          "In the long evolution of natural selection, microorganisms have developed sophisticated strategies to break down plant defense systems and acquire nutrients. ACT toxin is a unique secondary metabolite biosynthesized by the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata and plays a critical role in the virulence of this pathogen ( Masunaka et al., 2000 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). In this study, we have identified a transcription factor ( ACTR ) from ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster located in CDC1 of A. alternata tangerine pathotype. ACTR encodes a Zn2Cys6 domain transcription factor, which shares a conserved protein domain with the Japanese Pear pathotype AK-toxin regulator AKTR and strawberry pathotype AF-toxin regulator AFTR ( Hatta et al., 2002 ). Gene function analysis revealed that ACTR is essential for the ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity of A. alternata . Further studies indicated that ACTS4 , transcriptionally regulated by ACTR, is also required for the ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in A. alternata .",
          "Although it has been demonstrated that the ability to produce ACT toxin is required for the virulence of A. alternata tangerine pathotype ( Meena and Samal, 2019 ), the upstream genes responsible for the transcriptionally regulation of ACT toxin biosynthesis genes are yet unknown. Host-selective toxins produced by the A. alternata tangerine, strawberry, and Japanese pear pathotypes share a common structure EDA ( Meena and Samal, 2019 ). These three pathotypes contain many common genes required for the host-selective toxin biosynthesis ( Tsuge et al., 2013 ). In this study, we found that ACTR (in tangerine pathotype), AKTR (in Japanese pear pathotype) and AFTR (in strawberry pathotype) shared a highly conserved domain. Previous studies showed that both AKTR and AFTR work as key transcription factors responsible for the transcription of HST biosynthesis genes and thus required for HST production ( Hatta et al., 2002 ). The results of RT-qPCR showed that the transcription of ACTR is up-regulated when the wild-type is exposed to the crushed citrus leaves, indicating that ACTR responds to the induction of citrus leaves at the transcription level. The ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity capability decreased significantly in ACTR knock-down and knock-out transformants, indicating that ACTR plays a critical role in ACT toxin production and pathogenicity.",
          "Transcriptome analysis of gene expression profiles between ΔACTR and wild-type reveals that more than 3000 genes are positively or negatively regulated by ACTR. Among them, only one gene ( ACTS4 ) in the ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster was down-regulated in ACTR -disrupted mutant, indicating that ACTR has a positive regulatory effect on ACTS4 . Functional analysis of NR database indicated that ACTS4 encoded an acetyl-CoA synthetase-like protein and predicted that it was essential for ACT toxin synthesis. Pathogenicity assays demonstrated that ACTS4 as a down-stream gene of ACTR is essential for the virulence of A. alternata . Previous studies revealed that many genes in ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster, such as ACTT1, ACTT2, ACTT3, ACTT5, ACTT6, ACTTS2 and ACTTS3 , are required for the biosynthesis of ACT toxin and thereby essential for the virulence of A. alternata ( Masunaka et al., 2000 ; Tsuge et al., 2013 ). In the present study, we found that most ACT toxin genes including ACTT1, ACTT2, ACTT3, ACTT5, ACTT6, ACTTS2 and ACTTS3 were significantly up-regulated in ΔACTR compared to the wild-type. These results indicate that ACTS4 may be the most upstream gene in the ACT toxin synthesis pathway, and the gene silencing of ACTR can lead to a significant down-regulation of ACTS4 . The synthesis products regulated by ACTS4 may be the substrates of the downstream genes in the ACT toxin synthesis pathway, including the ACTT1, ACTT2, ACTT3, ACTT5, ACTT6, ACTTS2 and ACTTS3 . The failure of the ΔACTR mutant to produce enough ACT toxin may partly explain the up-regulation of these genes which is the case in the wild-type.",
          "Interestingly, stress sensitivity assays revealed that ACTR knock-out mutants and ACTS4 knock-down transformants displayed a wild-type level of sensitivity to multiple stresses, including oxidative stress, salt stress, cell-wall disrupting regents, and Cu 2+ , indicating that both ACTR and ACTS4 are not involved in the resistance to these stresses. Moreover, the necrotic lesions on detached pre-wounded and non-wounded citrus leaves induced by ΔACTR or D- ACTS4 were both much smaller than those induced by the wild-type, suggesting that both ACTR and ACTS4 are not required for breaching the cuticle of citrus leaves. For A. alternata tangerine pathotype, the capabilities of ACT toxin biosynthesis ( Meena and Samal, 2019 ), ROS detoxification ( Yang and Chung, 2012 ; Ma et al., 2018 ), and cuticle penetration ( Suzuki et al., 2003 ) are essential for the full virulence. Our results revealed that the effect of ACTR and ACTS4 on the virulence of A. alternata is achieved by the regulation of ACT toxin production, rather than ROS detoxification or cuticle penetration."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction The ascomycete fungi belonging to the Alternaria genus contain more than 400 species that are extensively found in air, soil or decaying plant tissues. Most Alternaria species are common saprophytes that derive energy through cellulose decomposition activities, and are found in a variety of habitats as ubiquitous decay agents. However, some Alternaria species have acquired the ability to cause disease over a broad host range. For instance, Alternaria alternata consists of at least seven pathotypes, each of which produces a specific host-selective toxin (HST) with a unique chemical structure, which is only toxic to susceptible host plants ( Tsuge et al., 2013 ; Meena and Samal, 2019 ). A. alternata producing AK-toxin, AM-toxin, AF-toxin, AL-toxin and AT-toxin show virulence specifically to the Japanese pear, apple, strawberry, tomato and tobacco, respectively ( Tsuge et al., 2013 ). In the citrus plant, two A. alternata pathotypes have been found, including rough lemon and tangerine pathotypes. The rough lemon pathotype mostly infects Rough Lemon ( Citrus jambhiri Lush) and Limeng ( C. limonia Osbeck), and lead to rough lemon leaf spot via the production of ACRL (Alternaria citri Rough Lemon) ( Izumi et al., 2012 ). The A. alternata tangerine pathotype produces ACT (Alternaria citri Tangerine) toxin, which is specifically toxic to tangerine ( Citrus reticulata Blanco), grapefruit ( C. paradisi Macfad.), and their hybrids, causing Alternaria brown spots (ABS) of citrus ( Miyamoto et al., 2009 ). In the infection process of citrus brown spot pathogen, ACT toxin occupies an absolutely important position, which can cause the rupture of citrus cell plasma membrane and cause rapid electrolyte leakage ( Tsuge et al., 2013 ; Meena and Samal, 2019 ). Previous studies have revealed that ACT toxin at a concentration of 2 × 10 −8 M causes necrosis lesions on citrus leaves with a rapid loss of electrolytes from host cells, which is essential for the full virulence of A. alternata tangerine pathotype ( Kohmoto et al., 1993 ; Meena and Samal, 2019 ). Interestingly, ACT toxin, AK-toxin and AF-toxin share a common chemical structure, which is called 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-tridecenoic acid (EDA). The chemical structure of ACT toxin consists of three parts: EDA, valine and polyketide. The ACT toxin mainly includes ACT toxin I and ACT toxin II, of which ACT I is the main component ( Kohmoto et al., 1993 ). The biosynthesis of ACT toxin is regulated by multiple genes of ACT toxin gene cluster in the conditionally dispensable chromosome (CDC) ( Wang et al., 2019 ). Until now, more than seven genes have been reported to be required for the biosynthesis of ACT toxin, including ACTT1 , ACTT2 , ACTT3 , ACTT5 , ACTT6 , ACTTS2 and ACTTS3 ( Masunaka et al., 2000 , 2005 ; Miyamoto et al., 2008 ; Tsuge et al., 2013 ). Among them, ACTT1, ACTT2 are considered as the homologous genes of AKT1, AKT2 in the Japanese Pear pathotype, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of the decatrienoic acid moiety in the tangerine pathotype ( Miyamoto et al., 2008 ). ACTT5 and ACTT6 encode acetyl-CoA synthetase and enoyl-CoA hydratase, respectively, and the corresponding homologous genes also exist in the Japanese Pear pathotype ( Miyamoto et al., 2009 ). Interestingly, there are two genes, including ACTTS2 (encoding enoyl reductase) and ACTTS3 (encoding peptide synthetase), that are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ACT toxin ( Ajiro et al., 2010 ; Miyamoto et al., 2010 ). In addition, current studies mainly focus on genes directly involved in the biosynthesis of ACT toxin, and the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of these genes are still poorly understood. In the present study, a homolog of the Zn2Cys6 transcription factor ACTR in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata was identified and functionally characterized to further understand the regulation of host-selective toxin biosynthesis and its significance in pathogenesis. The comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type and ACTR mutant were performed to provide novel data for ACTR-mediated host-selective toxin biosynthesis in A. alternata tangerine pathotype. The ACTR mutation perturbs the expression of a large number of secondary metabolite (SM) genes, including these genes related to the ACT toxin biosynthesis pathway. Our results underline the important regulatory role of ACTR in ACT toxin biosynthesis through mediating ACT toxin synthesis gene ACTS4, and expanded our understanding of the essential role of ACT toxin biosynthesis in the pathogenesis of necrotrophic fungus A. alternata . 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Fungal strains and culture conditions The A. alternata Z7 strain (deposited at China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center with the accession number CGMCC3.18907) was isolated from Alternaria brown spot (ABS) infected citrus leaves collected from Zhejiang Province, China and was used as the parental strain for genetic transformation ( Huang et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2016 ). Unless otherwise indicated, fungal strains were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (potato 200 g, glucose 20 g, and agar 20 g, per liter of purified water) or in liquid potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 26℃ for 5 days. Conidia produced by fungal strains cultured on PDA were collected by flooding, scraping with sterile water. Fungal strains were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium, V8 medium (V8 broth 200 mL, CaCO 3 3 g and agar 20 g, per liter of purified water), minimal medium (MM) and complete medium (CM) at 26 °C to evaluate their growth and colony characteristics as previously described ( Gai et al., 2021 ). 2.2 Expression of the ACTR gene in different infection stages To quantitatively detect the expression of ACTR gene in different infection stages, qRT-PCR was performed using Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection Systems (Bio-Rad, USA). The fungus A. alternata strain Z7 was cultured in liquid PDB medium at 26 °C on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm for 48 h. After the mycelia were inoculated on tangerine ( Citrus reticulata Blanco) leaves for 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 h, the treated mycelia were immediately crabbed from tangerine leaves and ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. Fungal RNA was extracted from each sample using the AxyPrep Multisource Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen Biotechnology, Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5 μg RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a HiScript II Q RT SuperMix Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). The Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection Systems was used for qRT-PCR with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. For each sample, all treatments were performed in triplicate. A. alternata actin gene was used as an endogenous control in this study. All the primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. 2.3 Constructions of mutant strains The ACT toxin gene cluster was annotated by antiSMASH fungal version 5.0. For ACTR -silencing mutant construction, two ACTR fragments (509 bp) were amplified with primer set ACTR-pLF/ACTR-pLR and ACTR-pRF/ACTR-pRR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were inserted into the pSilent-1 plasmid carrying a hygromycin-resistance gene as previously described ( Nunes and Dean, 2012 ). For ACTS4 -silencing mutant construction, two ACTS4 fragments (461 bp) were amplified with primer set ACTS4-pLF/ACTS4-pLR and ACTS4-pRF/ACTS4-pRR by PCR and were inserted into the pSilent-1 plasmid carrying a hygromycin-resistance gene. For ACTR disruption, the upstream and downstream flanking regions of the ACTR gene were amplified with the primer pairs ACTR-pro1F/M14R::ACTR and M14F::ACTR/ACTR-tail, respectively, and were fused with a partial hygromycin gene (HY/g and h/YG) by fusion PCR to generate two DNA fragments (5′ACTR::HY/g and h/YG::3′ACTR) overlapping the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (HYG). The resultant plasmid or DNA fragments were transformed into protoplasts of A. alternata wild-type using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and CaCl 2 as previously described ( Fu et al., 2020 ). Transformants growing on a regeneration medium amended with 100 μg/mL hygromycin were selected, examined by PCR with specific primer pairs upstream and downstream primers. The expression of the transcription factor ACTR was verified by qPCR. All the primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. 2.4 Fungal growth and stress sensitivity assays The A. alternata wild-type strain Z7 and its derivative mutants were grown on PDA media supplemented with one of 10 mM H 2 O 2 (hydrogen peroxide), 1 mM CuSO 4 , 0.02 % SDS, 1 M Sorbitol, 0.5 mM CongoRed, 1 M KCl, 250 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM t -BHP (tert-butyl-hydroperoxide), 1 M NaCl. The mycelial growth rate and colony morphology were measured after the plates were incubated at 26 °C for 5 days. The conidial productions were measured after the V8 medium of each strain was incubated at 26 °C for 14 days as previously described ( Gai et al., 2019 ). The conidia suspension was suspended in 5 mL sterile water, filtered with filter paper and counted with a hemocytometer under an optical microscope. All the experiments were performed at least twice, with three replicates of each treatment. 2.5 Virulence assays Fungal virulence was evaluated on detached citrus ( Citrus reticulata Blanco) leaves by inoculating with a 5-mm mycelial plug from PDA medium as previously described ( Ma et al., 2018 ). After inoculation, the leaves were put into a moist box and incubated at 26 °C for 3 days to observe the development of disease symptoms. To further investigate whether the reduced pathogenicity of fungal mutants is caused by the inability to penetrate the host cells, a wound inoculation test was carried out on the detached citrus leaves. Followed by incubation at 26 ℃ for 2–3 days until the lesions expand. We tested at least 30 leaves per strain, and the whole experiment was repeated twice. 2.6 ACT toxin assays For ACT purification, fungal strains were grown in a 300-mL Richard’s solution (glucose 25 g, KNO 3 10 g, KH 2 PO 4 5 g, MgSO 4 2.5 g, FeCl 3 0.02 g, and ZnSO 4 0.005 g, 1 L water) at 26 °C for 24 days ( Fu et al., 2020 ). The mycelia were filtered with four layers of cheesecloth and adjusted to pH 5.5 with 10 % NaH 2 PO 4 . For high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, cultural filtrates were mixed with Amberlite XAD-2 resins (1:30, w:v) for 2 h and loaded into a column. The ACT toxin was eluted from the Amberlite XAD-2 resins with 40 mL methanol. Methanol was dried in a rotary evaporator, and ACT toxin was dissolved in 1 mL methanol. ACT toxin was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis as previously described ( Ma et al., 2019 ). 2.7 Transcriptome analysis Mycelia of tested strains were cultured in liquid PDB medium at 26 °C in a rotary shaker for 2 days, harvested, and ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle for RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using the Axygen RNA purification kit (Capital Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity and concentration were assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). RNA-Seq was performed using three biological replicates of each sample. The libraries were constructed using Ultra RNA Library Prep kit (NEB) and were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer platform (Illumina Inc.) to generate 150 bp paired-end reads. Raw RNA-Seq reads were processed to remove adaptors and low-quality bases using Trimmomatic v0.36 ( Bolger et al., 2014 ). The cleaned reads were mapped to the A. alternata Z7 using HISAT2 version 2.1.0 ( Kim et al., 2015 ). The number of reads mapped to each gene was counted by HTSeq ( Anders et al., 2015 ) and the resulting transcript count tables were subjected to R DESeq package with a preset FDR ≤ 0.05 and Log2FC ≥ 2 for differential expression analysis ( Love et al., 2014 ). Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and functional term mapping were performed using Blast2GO software ( Conesa et al., 2005 ). The DEGs were classified into GO categories using Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot 2.0 (WEGO) ( Ye et al., 2006 ). Secondary metabolite (SM) biosynthesis gene clusters were identified in A. alternata Z7 genome by antiSMASH 5.0 ( Blin et al., 2019 ). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and SM gene clusters were plotted using Circos ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 ). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed for mapping enzymes onto known metabolic pathways ( Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 ). The GO enrichment and KEGG Pathway enrichment were performed using R clusterProfiler package ( Yu et al., 2012 ). The KEGG Pathway was illustrated using R Pathview package ( Luo and Brouwer, 2013 ). 2.8 RT-qPCR analysis To verify the transcriptome data obtained by RNA-Seq, the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection Systems (Bio-Rad, USA). The fungus A. alternaria wildtype Z7 and Δ ACTR mutant were cultivated in 150-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of liquid PDB medium and incubated at 26 °C on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm in the dark for two days. For RNA extraction, the mycelia of Z7 and Δ ACTR mutant were immediately filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, freeze-dried and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. 2.9 Statistical analysis The significance of treatments was determined by analysis of variance and means separated by Ducan’s test (P < 0.05). 3 Results 3.1 Identification and characterization of ACTR in A. alternata Previously, our group have identified an ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster from the genome sequence of A. alternata tangerine pathotype Z7 (GenBank accession no. GCA_001572055.1; http://www.zjudata.com/alternaria/blast.php ) ( Wang et al., 2016 ). In the present work, we identified an AKTR homolog in the whole genome of Z7, and thus we designated this gene ACTR (GenBank accession no. MW311077, also known as ACTTR ). Protein domain analysis showed that ACTR contained a Zn2Cys6 DNA binding site (Interpro Accession no. IPR001138). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the GO terms of ACTR belong to “regulation of transcription, DNA-templated (GO:0006355)”, “DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (GO:0000981)” and “zinc ion binding (GO:0008270)”. The ACTR gene contains a 1335 bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a 444 amino-acid polypeptide, with a predicted molecular mass of 49.09 kDa. 3.2 ACTR gene is upregulated in the stages of infection of A. alternata To explore the regulatory role of ACTR in pathogenesis, we examined the transcriptional profile of the ACTR gene in infection stages, including 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 h post-inoculation. Our qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcript level of ACTR was up-regulated in the stages of infection compared with the transcript level of ACTR gene in wild-type under vegetative growth stage ( Fig. 1 ), suggesting that ACTR may play a potentially important role in the infection stages. 3.3 Inactivation of ACTR does not affect fungal development and stress tolerance We use two independent methods to construct ACTR -silent and -disrupted mutant to verify the biological functions of ACTR . To generate the ACTR -silenced mutants, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated protoplast transformation with the pSilent-1 vector carrying ACTR . Three transformants were obtained through antibiotic resistance screening and confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Among them, the transcriptional level of transformant D- ACTR ( PS-R2 ) in mycelium was significantly lower than that of wild-type strain Z7. To generate ACTR -disrupted mutants, we inserted a 2.2 kb hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (HYG) cassette into the ORF of ACTR gene through a split maker approach. In total, 12 fungal transformants were recovered after transformation of two split HYG/ACTR fragments. Among them, the transcriptional level of transformant ⊿ ACTR ( 4-AR ) in mycelium was significantly lower than that of wild-type strain Z7. Therefore, the ACTR- silent mutant D-ACTR ( PS-R2 ) and ACTR -disrupted mutant ⊿ ACTR ( 4-AR ) were selected to verify the biological functions of ACTR. The disruption of ⊿ ACTR ( 4-AR ) gene was confirmed by PCR with targeted gene disruption. The ACTR- silent mutant D-ACTR and ACTR -disrupted mutant ⊿ ACTR showed wild-type growth on artificial medium, although the growth rate of ACTR mutants and wild-type may be slightly different ( Fig. 2 A,B). Chemical sensitivity assays performed on PDA revealed that ACTR mutants displayed wild-type resistance to oxidative stress (BHP, H 2 O 2 ), salt stress (NaCl, CaCl 2 , KCl), and metal ion stress (CuSO 4 ), sorbitol, cell-wall disrupting regents (Congo red), SDS, although the growth rate of ACTR mutants and wild-type may be slightly different in some chemical media ( Fig. 2 A,B). Microscopic examination revealed that both ⊿ ACTR and D- ACTR strains produced ovoid conidia with both longitudinal and cross septae with dark pigmentation similar to those produced by the wild-type ( Fig. 2 C,D). Morphological analysis indicated that the inactivation of the ACTR gene does not affect fungal development and stress tolerance. 3.4 Inactivation of ACTR significantly decreased the virulence To study the possible effect of ACTR on the virulence of A. alternata , infection assays were carried out on citrus leaves. Pathogenicity assays revealed that ACTR plays a critical role in pathogenicity, as D- ACTR mutant failed to induce any necrotic lesions on detached citrus leaves. Most citrus leaves did not form necrotic lesions after inoculation with ⊿ ACTR mutant, while all citrus leaves inoculated with wild-type strain showed severe brown spots. However, compared with the wild-type, the ⊿ ACTR mutant formed significantly smaller lesions in these citrus leaves ( Fig. 3 A). We also tested the effects of wound inoculation on pathogenicity to investigate whether the reduced pathogenicity of fungal mutants is caused by the inability to penetrate the citrus leaves. Three days after inoculation, the citrus leaves inoculated with wild-type showed severe necrotic lesions, while the citrus leaves inoculated with ACTR mutants showed no or much smaller necrotic lesions, suggesting that ACTR is not involved in the capability of the fungus to penetrate the host. Taken together, our results indicate that ACTR is essential for the virulence of A. alternata tangerine pathotype. 3.5 Inactivation of ACTR significantly impaired ACT-toxin biosynthesis Pathogenicity assays revealed that the inactivation of ACTR gene significantly impaired the virulence of ACTR mutants, so we also analyzed the production of ACT toxin of ACTR mutants. ACT was purified from cultural filtrates and analyzed by HPLC, showed that ACTR-silenced mutant (D- ACTR ) and ACTR-disrupted mutant (⊿ ACTR ) produced a much smaller quantity of ACT toxin than that of wild-type. These results indicate that the inactivation of ACTR significantly affects the production of ACT toxin ( Fig. 3 B). 3.6 Data mining of transcriptome profile of ACTR mutant Transcriptome analysis was performed to compare the whole gene expression profiles between the wild-type and ⊿ ACTR mutant. In total, 3354 genes differentially expressed genes (DEGs) consisting of 1336 up-regulated and 2018 down-regulated genes were identified in ⊿ ACTR compared to the wild-type strain ( Fig. 4 A, Supplementary Table S2). Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to explore the function and regulatory role of DEGs in A. alternata . WEGO analysis revealed that most DEGs belong to “catalytic activity”,” binding”, “transporter activity”, “structural molecule activity”, “transcription regulator activity” ( Fig. 4 B). To further elucidate the detailed GO annotation of DEGs, we used the R clusterProfiler packages for GO enrichment analysis and found that most DEGs belong to the” oxidation-reduction process”, “oxidoreductase activity”, “catalytic activity”, “integral component of membrane”, “transmembrane transport”, “metabolic process”, “protein binding”, “ATP binding”, “membrane”, “zinc ion binding” (Supplementary Table S3). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up-regulated genes revealed that the inactivation of ACTR extensively affects gene expression in several metabolic pathways, including “Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis”,” Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum”,” Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism”,” Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism”,” Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)” ( Fig. 4 C, Supplementary Table S4). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of down-regulated genes showed that the inactivation of ACTR widely influences the “Arginine and proline metabolism”,” Starch and sucrose metabolism”,” Tyrosine metabolism”,” Tryptophan metabolism” ( Fig. 4 D, Supplementary Table S5). Circos plot analysis showed the genomic location of genes differentially expressed in ⊿ ACTR mutant, as well as the location, length, and expression level of genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis ( Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, we found that most genes on the conditionally dispensable chromosome (CDC) are down-regulated in ⊿ ACTR mutant, while a few ACT-toxin genes are up-regulated in ⊿ ACTR mutant, indicating that ACTR plays different roles in the regulation of CDC genes. 3.7 Inactivation of ACTR widely affects the expression of SM gene clusters To explore the relationship of secondary metabolites (SM) and pathogenicity mediated by ACTR , we examined the transcription response of 30 SM gene clusters in A. alternata predicted by antiSMASH 5.0 (Supplementary Table S6). In general, ACTR showed a broad regulation of SM gene clusters ( Fig. 6 A). The transcript level of cluster1 NRPS, cluster5 T1PKS (Alternapyrone), cluster6 NRPS (Dimethylcoprogen), cluster7 T1PKS, cluster18 NRPS, cluster29 NRPS (ACT-Toxin), cluster19 NRPS_like (Phomopsins) were strongly affected in ACTR -disrupted mutants, indicating that ACTR has an extensive regulatory effect on these gene clusters. The ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster located in CDC 1 is essential for ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity. Interestingly, transcriptome profiles showed that the transcript level of AALT_g11744 (putative membrane protein gene), AALT_g11751 (ACTT5, acyl-synthetase gene), AALT_g11752, and AALT_g11753 were significantly up-regulated while the transcript level of AALT_g11749 ( ACTS4 , non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene) were down-regulated in ⊿ ACTR compared to the wild-type ( Fig. 6 A). The expression profiles of 14 genes located in the ACT toxin gene cluster were validated by RT-qPCR. The expression of three genes (AALT_g11744, AALT_g11751, and AALT_g11753) were up-regulated and ACTS4 (AALT_g11749) were down-regulated in ⊿ ACTR , which was consistent with the results of RNA-Seq ( Fig. 6 B). RT-qPCR analysis also revealed that the expression of AALT_g11742 (CENP-B protein), AALT_g11743 (ACTT2), AALT_g11746 (Tfo1 transposase), AALT_g11750 (polyketide synthase ACTTS3), AALT_g11756 (c6 zinc finger-like protein), AALT_g11757 (polyketide synthase ACT16), and AALT_g11758 (ACT11) were up-regulated in ⊿ ACTR mutant. Transcriptome and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the inactivation of ACTR gene broadly affects the expression of many genes of SM gene clusters. In particular, ACTR disruption caused a significant down-regulation of ACTS4 gene located in the ACT toxin gene cluster ( Fig. 6 A and B). These results indicate that ACTR may play an important role in ACT toxin biosynthesis through mediating ACT toxin synthesis gene ACTS4 . 3.8 Inactivation of ACTS4 does not affect vegetative growth and stress response Gene structure analysis revealed that ACTS4 coding gene contains a 4215 bp open reading frame (ORF). ACTS4 encodes a 1404 amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 156.14 kDa. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the transcription level of ACTS4 was significantly up-regulated when the wild-type was treated with crushed Citrus leaves. Similar to Δ ACTR, D- ACTS4 displayed wild-type radial growth on PDA, V8, MM, and CM medium. Microscopic observation showed that the conidiation and mycelial morphology of D- ACTS4 is similar to the wild-type. In addition, D- ACTS4 displayed wild-type sensitivity to multiple stresses, such as oxidative stress, salt stress, cell-wall disrupting regents, and Cu 2+ , which is consistent with the phenotype of ΔACTR ( Fig. 7 A, B). 3.9 ACTS4 is required for the pathogenicity of A. alternata The amino acid sequence analysis showed that ACTS4 was an acetyl-CoA synthetase-like protein, which was essential for ACT toxin biosynthesis. Given that the transcription of ACTS4 is positively regulated by ACTR and crushed citrus leaves treatment, we speculated that ACTR regulates ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity of A. alternata via the transcriptional regulation of ACTS4 . To test this hypothesis, we obtained ACTS4 knock-down transformants (D- ACTS4 ) and performed a phenotypic analysis of D- ACTS4 . Similar to ΔACTR , virulence assays performed on detached citrus leaves revealed that D- ACTS4 failed to induce visible necrotic lesions 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) indicating that ACTS4 is essential for the pathogenicity of A. alternata ( Fig. 7 C). 4 Discussion In the long evolution of natural selection, microorganisms have developed sophisticated strategies to break down plant defense systems and acquire nutrients. ACT toxin is a unique secondary metabolite biosynthesized by the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata and plays a critical role in the virulence of this pathogen ( Masunaka et al., 2000 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). In this study, we have identified a transcription factor ( ACTR ) from ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster located in CDC1 of A. alternata tangerine pathotype. ACTR encodes a Zn2Cys6 domain transcription factor, which shares a conserved protein domain with the Japanese Pear pathotype AK-toxin regulator AKTR and strawberry pathotype AF-toxin regulator AFTR ( Hatta et al., 2002 ). Gene function analysis revealed that ACTR is essential for the ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity of A. alternata . Further studies indicated that ACTS4 , transcriptionally regulated by ACTR, is also required for the ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in A. alternata . Although it has been demonstrated that the ability to produce ACT toxin is required for the virulence of A. alternata tangerine pathotype ( Meena and Samal, 2019 ), the upstream genes responsible for the transcriptionally regulation of ACT toxin biosynthesis genes are yet unknown. Host-selective toxins produced by the A. alternata tangerine, strawberry, and Japanese pear pathotypes share a common structure EDA ( Meena and Samal, 2019 ). These three pathotypes contain many common genes required for the host-selective toxin biosynthesis ( Tsuge et al., 2013 ). In this study, we found that ACTR (in tangerine pathotype), AKTR (in Japanese pear pathotype) and AFTR (in strawberry pathotype) shared a highly conserved domain. Previous studies showed that both AKTR and AFTR work as key transcription factors responsible for the transcription of HST biosynthesis genes and thus required for HST production ( Hatta et al., 2002 ). The results of RT-qPCR showed that the transcription of ACTR is up-regulated when the wild-type is exposed to the crushed citrus leaves, indicating that ACTR responds to the induction of citrus leaves at the transcription level. The ACT toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity capability decreased significantly in ACTR knock-down and knock-out transformants, indicating that ACTR plays a critical role in ACT toxin production and pathogenicity. Transcriptome analysis of gene expression profiles between ΔACTR and wild-type reveals that more than 3000 genes are positively or negatively regulated by ACTR. Among them, only one gene ( ACTS4 ) in the ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster was down-regulated in ACTR -disrupted mutant, indicating that ACTR has a positive regulatory effect on ACTS4 . Functional analysis of NR database indicated that ACTS4 encoded an acetyl-CoA synthetase-like protein and predicted that it was essential for ACT toxin synthesis. Pathogenicity assays demonstrated that ACTS4 as a down-stream gene of ACTR is essential for the virulence of A. alternata . Previous studies revealed that many genes in ACT toxin biosynthesis gene cluster, such as ACTT1, ACTT2, ACTT3, ACTT5, ACTT6, ACTTS2 and ACTTS3 , are required for the biosynthesis of ACT toxin and thereby essential for the virulence of A. alternata ( Masunaka et al., 2000 ; Tsuge et al., 2013 ). In the present study, we found that most ACT toxin genes including ACTT1, ACTT2, ACTT3, ACTT5, ACTT6, ACTTS2 and ACTTS3 were significantly up-regulated in ΔACTR compared to the wild-type. These results indicate that ACTS4 may be the most upstream gene in the ACT toxin synthesis pathway, and the gene silencing of ACTR can lead to a significant down-regulation of ACTS4 . The synthesis products regulated by ACTS4 may be the substrates of the downstream genes in the ACT toxin synthesis pathway, including the ACTT1, ACTT2, ACTT3, ACTT5, ACTT6, ACTTS2 and ACTTS3 . The failure of the ΔACTR mutant to produce enough ACT toxin may partly explain the up-regulation of these genes which is the case in the wild-type. Interestingly, stress sensitivity assays revealed that ACTR knock-out mutants and ACTS4 knock-down transformants displayed a wild-type level of sensitivity to multiple stresses, including oxidative stress, salt stress, cell-wall disrupting regents, and Cu 2+ , indicating that both ACTR and ACTS4 are not involved in the resistance to these stresses. Moreover, the necrotic lesions on detached pre-wounded and non-wounded citrus leaves induced by ΔACTR or D- ACTS4 were both much smaller than those induced by the wild-type, suggesting that both ACTR and ACTS4 are not required for breaching the cuticle of citrus leaves. For A. alternata tangerine pathotype, the capabilities of ACT toxin biosynthesis ( Meena and Samal, 2019 ), ROS detoxification ( Yang and Chung, 2012 ; Ma et al., 2018 ), and cuticle penetration ( Suzuki et al., 2003 ) are essential for the full virulence. Our results revealed that the effect of ACTR and ACTS4 on the virulence of A. alternata is achieved by the regulation of ACT toxin production, rather than ROS detoxification or cuticle penetration. 5 Conclusions In summary, this study provides genetic evidence to define the biological and pathological function of transcription factor ACTR and its downstream gene ACTS4 in A. alternata tangerine pathotype. Both ACTR and ACTS4 are required for the pathogenicity, and the reduced virulence of ACTR or ACTS4 deficient transformants is attributable to ACT toxin biosynthesis deficiency. This work expands our understanding of how and which upstream gene affects ACT toxin production via the transcriptional regulation of ACT toxin biosynthesis genes. Overall, our research further underlines the important role of ACT toxin in the virulence of A. alternata tangerine pathotype.
