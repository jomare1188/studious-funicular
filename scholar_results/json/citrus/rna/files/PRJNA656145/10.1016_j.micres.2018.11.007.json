    "full_text": "The tangerine pathotype of A. alternata, which produces a unique host-selective ACT toxin causes brown spots on citrus leaves and fruits. In this study, we report a methionine biosynthesis regulator (MetR), which belong to bZIP transcription factor, is required for methionine metabolism, oxidative stress tolerance and pathogenicity. We generated two Δ AaMetR mutants in the tangerine pathotype of Alternaria alternata and investigated the resulting mutant phenotypes. The ΔAaMetR disruption mutant grew poorly in the absence of methionine and unable to produce conidia. Furthermore, pathogenicity tests have shown that ΔAaMetR mutant on their tangerine host can neither penetrate nor cause disease. These ΔAaMetR mutants exhibit an increased sensitivity to exogenous H 2 O 2 and many ROS generating oxidants. To elucidate the transcription network of AaMetR, we performed RNA-Seq experiments on wild-type and ΔAaMetR mutant and identified genes that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes. Transcriptome data demonstrated that AaMetR contributes in many other biological processes including ROS detoxification, sulfur transfer, and amino acid metabolism. Comparative transcriptome analysis indicated that the ΔAaMetR mutant up-regulated several genes involved in cysteine and methionine metabolism. In conclusion, our results highlight the global regulatory role of AaMetR in cysteine and methionine metabolism and provide new insights into the crucial role of ROS detoxification, sporulation and pathogenicity in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata ."

          "To successfully cause disease, pathogenic microorganisms must overwhelm the host’s immune defenses, spread throughout the entire tissue and acquire nutrients from the cells. When pathogens infect plant, inducers in the plant cells bind to receptors on cell membranes, activate G protein, and then Ca 2+ enters the cell to activate the protein kinase, which acts on the membrane of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase to produce toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Bowler and Fluhr, 2000 ; Gilroy et al., 2014 ). ROS are reactive chemical species containing oxygen, such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radicals (OH·) and superoxide (O .− 2 ) ( Schopfer et al., 2001 ; Giorgio et al., 2007 ). Under normal condition, host cells typically maintain ROS at relatively low, sub-toxic levels. However, ROS levels can increase dramatically after the host recognizes pathogens ( Wojtaszek, 1997 ). Excessive production of ROS can cause oxidative damage to membrane lipids, proteins, other cellular molecules, and ultimately kill pathogens and host cells, which is known as hypersensitive response (HR) ( Bandyopadhyay et al., 1999 ). Therefore, the pathogen must be able to withstand the toxic ROS after penetrating the host cell.",
          "Pathogens have evolved strategies to overcome plant defense responses. For example, the filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler produces a unique host-selective toxin (HST) that kills host cells prior to invasion and nutrient acquisition ( Akimitsu et al., 2014 ; Tsuge et al., 2016 ). A. alternata consists of at least seven pathotypes, each of which can cause diseases in a variety of important crops, including Japanese pear, tangerine, apple, strawberry, rough lemon, tomato, and tobacco ( Akimitsu et al., 2014 ). Two distinct pathotypes of A. alternata have been found in citrus. One is the rough lemon pathotype of A. alternata, which produces host-selective ACRL toxin that is pathogenic to rough lemon ( Citrus jambhiri Lush) and Pangpur lime ( Citrus limonia Osbech), causing leaf spot ( Akimitsu et al., 1989 ; Peever et al., 1999 , 2004 ). The other is the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata, which produces a unique host-selective toxin called ACT toxin that causes brown spots on citrus leaves and fruits ( Kohmoto et al., 1991 ; Akimitsu et al., 2003 ; Huang et al., 2015 ). The tangerine pathotype of A. alternata is pathogenic to tangerines ( Citrus reticulata Blanco), grapefruit ( Citrus paradisi Merced.), their hybrids, as well as hybrids from tangerine and sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), but not toxic in rough lemon ( Ma et al., 2018 ). Previous studies have shown that at least seven ACTT genes are present in multiple copies of gene clusters on less than 2.0 Mb of the conditionally dispensable chromosome (CDC), which is essential for the biosynthesis of ACT toxin ( Tsuge et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). RNA silencing of any ACTT gene leads to no production of ACT toxin and loss of pathogenicity ( Miyamoto et al., 2008 ; Wang et al., 2017 ).",
          "Sulfur is an essential mineral element that plays an important role in many biological processes ( Kellogg et al., 1972 ). Sulfur is a crucial constituent of some amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine ( Brosnan and Brosnan, 2006 ). Methionine plays a critical role in various cellular metabolic pathways in all organisms ( Shoveller et al., 2005 ). For example, under the catalysis of methionine adenosyltransferase, methionine can bind to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to synthesize S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which is a key source of activated methyl groups in all organisms. It can also be served as a source of activated C3 aminopropyl units for polyamine biosynthesis in the cell cycle ( Wang et al., 2005 ). S-adenosyl methionine is the major methyl donor in biomethylation and involves in methyl transfer, transsulfurization and aminopropylation, which are required for cell growth and regeneration( Cantoni, 1975 ; Lu, 2000 ). Microorganisms, plants, and animals are different in terms of obtaining methionine. Plants and microorganisms can acquire mineral sulfur from the environment through the aspartate biosynthetic pathway and de novo synthesize methionine ( Ravanel et al., 2004 ). In contrast, animals cannot synthesize methionine and must acquire methionine from their diet ( Ball et al., 2006 ). As a result, the methionine biosynthetic pathway is a common target for antifungal agents because of the presence of methionine biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and absence in the animal kingdom. Ebelactone A is a beta-lactonease inhibitor that inhibits N-formylmethionine aminopeptidases on cell surface and stimulates host defense ( Paterson and Hulme, 1995 ). Another compound strongly affecting methionine biosynthesis is the antibiotic azoxybacillin, which is shown to induce five sulfate assimilation enzymes, especially ATP sulfurylase and homoserine transacetylase ( Jastrzębowska and Gabriel, 2015 ).",
          "In the present study, a homolog of the bZIP transcription factor MetR in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata was identified and functionally characterized to further understand the mechanism of methionine biosynthesis. Comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type and AaMetR disruption mutant ΔAaMetR was performed to provide a novel data for AaMetR-mediated regulation of gene expression in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata . The ΔAaMetR mutation perturb the expression of a large number of genes, including those associated with the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway. Most of the differentially expressed genes are up-regulated in the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathways in the ΔAaMetR mutant, suggesting that AaMetR plays a negative regulatory role in cysteine and methionine metabolism."

Briefly, two DNA fragments (5′ MetR ::5′ HYG and 3′ MetR ::3′ HYG ) overlapped with the hygromycin phosophotransferase gene (HYG) cassette were constructed separately by fusion PCR. Two purified fragments were transformed into protoplasts of A. alternaria strain Z7 using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and CaCl 2 ( Yang and Chung, 2013 ). The transformants were cultured on PDA medium amended with 100 ug/mL hygromycin. To identify transformants carrying the mutation, the resistant transformants were screened by PCR using the inner and flanking primers of the HYG and MetR genes. For AaMetR gene complementation, a 3.6 kb DNA fragment containing AaMetR promoter and AaMetR gene was PCR amplified and cloned to the linearized pA1300-NEO vector by recombination method using ClonExpress II (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). After confirming the integrity of the recombinant plasmid by sequencing, the plasmid containing AaMetR gene were transformed into the protoplasts of ΔAaMetR .

A. alternata wild-type Z7 grew well on all four media, while AaMetR1 and AaMetR2 were only able to grow on PDA and CM. The ΔAaMetR mutant could not grow on V8 and MM media ( Figs. 4 and 5 A ). Furthermore, the colony morphology of ΔAaMetR mutant were distinct from the wild-type strain on PDA. On PDA medium, the colony of wild-type strain Z7 was initially light brown, then turned brown to dark brown within 3–5 days, producing abundant aerial hyphae. In contrast, the ΔAaMetR mutant consistently produced white to pale colonies without aerial hyphae (Fig. S2). After introducing the AaMetR gene, the complementary strain ΔAaMetR / MetR was able to grow on all four media and exhibited colony morphology similar to wild-type, indicating that the aberrant morphological phenotypes were caused by AaMetR disruption ( Figs. 4 and 5 A)."

Three days after inoculation, symptoms with circular to irregular brown necrosis were fully developed on detached citrus leaves inoculated with the wild-type strain Z7, but no lesion were observed on the leaves inoculated with ΔAaMetR mutant ( Fig. 7 A and B). The loss of pathogenicity was complemented in ΔAaMetR / MetR . To further investigate the loss-of-pathogenicity due to the inability of the ΔAaMetR mutant to penetrate the host cells, wound inoculation experiments were conducted on detached tangerine leaves. Three days after inoculation, symptoms with brown spot were observed on the wound tangerine leaves inoculated with wild-type strain Z7. However, no visible symptoms were observed on wounded leaves inoculated with AaMetR mutant. Therefore, our results demonstrated that the disruption of AaMetR gene leaded to the complete loss of virulence of A. alternata .",
              "To further investigate the loss of pathogenicity of ΔAaMetR mutant due to the observed methionine auxotrophy, we inoculated detached tangerine leaves with 5-days-old mycelial plugs of ΔAaMetR mutant grown on PDA amended with 3 mM L-methionine. We used wild-type and ΔAaMetR mutant without methionine supplementation as control. Three days after inoculation, typical symptoms of brown spot were observed on detached leaves inoculated with wild-type strain Z7 as well as the ΔAaMetR mutant grown with methionine supplementation. The detached leaves inoculated with ΔAaMetR mutant without methionine supplementation were asymptomatic. Although the lesions induced by the ΔAaMetR mutant with methionine supplementation were less than that caused by the wild-type strain Z7 ( Fig. 7 C and D). This experiment suggests that the loss of pathogenicity in the ΔAaMetR mutant is caused by a defect in methionine biosysthesis. The ΔAaMetR mutant partially restored their virulence after supplementation with extraneous methionine."

Among these genes, Aa05306 is a MetC ortholog (cystathionine beta-lyase), which converts L-cystathionine to homocysteine. Aa05948 is a MetE ortholog, which is involved in catalyzing homocysteine to methionine. Aa10494 is an ortholog of msrC (methionine sulfoxide reductase C) that is involved in oxidative stress response and is specific for repairing free methionine sulfoxide. After disrupting AaMetR gene in A. alternata , the log 2 ratio value of msrC was 5.28-folds compare with wild-type.

          "The present study identified a homolog of the methionine biosynthesis regulator MetR, designated AaMetR, and further investigated the key role of this bZIP transcription factor in regulating methionine metabolism. Similar to other homologs of the bZIP transcription factor family, AaMetR contains a conserved leucine zipper (bZIP) domain and several conserved motifs that are critical for binding to the promoter region of the gene and regulating their expression. By analyzing the loss of function and complementation of AaMetR gene, we found that AaMetR gene is required for methionine metabolism, vegetative growth, conidial formation, pathogenicity and anti-oxidative stress. This work further demonstrated that the citrus pathogen A. alternata utilizes a complex pathway that modulates methionine biosynthesis through transcriptome analysis of the ΔAaMetR mutant and the wide-type strain Z7. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to quantify AaMetR expression under various stress condition, including H 2 O 2 , the injured tangerine leaves, FeSO4, CuSO4 and NaCl. The injured tangerine leaves are used to stimulate A. alternata , because after the plant is infected by microorganisms, NADPH oxidase can utilizes molecular electrons provided by NADPH to catalyze molecular oxygen (O 2 ) to superoxide anion (O 2− ), and then converted to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Therefore, the injured tangerine leaves can be used to stimulate A. alternata and to determine gene expression during the pathogen infecting the host plant. Compared to A. alternata wild-type Z7 in PDB, the expression of AaMetR gene was up-regulated at different levels of oxidative stress, metal ionic stress and injured tangerine leaves, implicating that the bZIP transcription factor AaMetR may be involved in the regulation of genes in responding to the exogenous oxidative stress.",
          "The ability of detoxified host-generating ROS is critical in the infection and colonization of pathogenic microorganisms. After disrupting AaMetR gene in A. alternata , the mutant became hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and various ROS-generating agents. The ΔAaMetR mutant was unable to grow on PDA medium containing 3 mM H 2 O 2 and other ROS-generating oxidants. ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) are by-products of aerobic metabolism, which are mainly generated by mitochondria and NADPH oxidases. Previous studies have demonstrated that NADPH oxidase components, including NoxA, NoxB and NoxR, are involved in the resistance to oxidative stress ( Yang and CHUNG, 2012 ,2013). A. allternata lacking NoxA , NoxB and NoxR genes displayed a slightly increased sensitivity to oxidants. Only double disrupting mutants lacking NoxA / NoxB or NoxA / NoxR genes exhibited significant sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )[41]. The ROS sensitivity phenotype of ΔAaMetR mutant is similar to that of the GPx3 , Yap1 and hog1 mutants, but more severe than any of these mutants ( Lin et al., 2009 ; Lin and Chung, 2010 ). Deletion of ap1 , hog1 , or GPx3 in A. allternata caused a considerable decrease in mycelial growth under oxidative stress. However, the ap1 and hog1 mutants were still able to grow on the PDA media containing H 2 O 2 and other ROS-generating oxidants, albeit much slower than wide-type. In contrast, A. alternata lacking AaMetR was unable to survive on PDA medium containing 3 mM H 2 O 2 . It appears that AaMetR significantly affects the ability to resist oxidative stress in A. alternata .",
          "Our study demonstrated that AaMetR is required for the pathogenicity of the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata. When pathogens invade a host plant, the level of ROS in the host cell increase dramatically, which kills the invading pathogen. However, microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to detoxify the ROS generated by host plants ( Apel and Hirt, 2004 ). AaMetR expression in wild-type A. alternata was significantly up-regulated in response to citrus leaves tangerine stimulation, which suggests that AaMetR may be involved in ROS response and host-pathogen interaction. Virulence assays demonstrate that the ΔAaMetR mutant is unable to induce necrotic lesions on detached citrus leaves, further confirming that AaMetR is required for the pathogenicity. Previous studies have demonstrated that MoMetR, the M. oryzae ortholog of AaMetR was essential for virulence of M. oryzae on rice [43]. However, the pathogenesis of M. oryzae and A. alternata is different. Many factors can affect the virulence of pathogenic fungi including the environment, host genotype, and the pathogen itself. In A. alternata , ROS detoxification and ACT toxin synthesis have been reported to be two critical factors that influence pathogenicity. Dysfunction of any ACTT genes of CDC could prevent ACT toxin secretion leading to loss-of-pathogenicity in A. alternata . AaMetR null mutants failed to induce necrotic lesions on both detached wounded and unwounded citrus leaves. The loss of pathogenicity by AaMetR null mutants may be due to their inability to resist or otherwise detoxify the ROS produced by host plant. ΔAaMetR mutant regain pathogenicity after complementation of AaMetR gene or after receiving methionine supplementation from media.",
          "The results of present study demonstrate that MetR plays a crucial role in vegetative growth and conidiogenesis. ΔAaMetR mutant could not grow on either V8 or MM media, and grew poorly on PDA when compared with wild-type strain Z7. It would probably be worth noting somewhere in the manuscript the differences between the different media types. The colorless mycelia suggest that ΔAaMetR mutant produce less of the black pigment melanin than wild-type fungus. Intriguingly, the rice pathogen Magnaporthe grisea requires melanization of its appressoria development and host penetration ( Howard and Ferrari, 1989 ). Unlike M. grisea , the appressoria of A. alternata is colorless and melanin is not required for appressoria development or host penetration ( Kawamura et al., 1997 ). Conidiogenesis is an important mechanism for the dispersal of A. alternata . The conidia of A. alternata in the field can be spread widely by wind and rain. Our study demonstrates that MetR is required for conidia formation. While wild-type Z7 produces typical Alternaria brown conidia, the ΔAaMetR mutant could not produce conidia on either PDA or CM media. The AaMetR mutant , however, produced wild-type levels of conidia the media supplemented with methionine indicating that methionine is required for conidiogenesis.",
          "In order to candidate methionine metabolism and oxidative stress resistance genes that are downstream of AaMetR transcription factor, we identified the differentially expressed genes in AaMetR mutant. In total, we identified 2042 genes with transcription levels log 2 FC ≥ 1.5 different from wild-type. Several of these genes, including MsrC , MetB , MetC , MetE and MetX were up-regulated, suggesting the genes in the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway were regulated by MetR . Previous studies have shown MsrC plays an important role in the oxidative stress response of Salmonella Typhimurium ( Denkel et al., 2011 , 2013 ). ΔmsrC mutant of S. Typhimurium could not survive when exposed to H 2 O 2 , and were unable to grow in either macrophages or in mice. Another important gene in this pathway MetR have affected is MetB , which is cystathionine y-synthase, the second enzyme of methionine biosynthetic pathway."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction To successfully cause disease, pathogenic microorganisms must overwhelm the host’s immune defenses, spread throughout the entire tissue and acquire nutrients from the cells. When pathogens infect plant, inducers in the plant cells bind to receptors on cell membranes, activate G protein, and then Ca 2+ enters the cell to activate the protein kinase, which acts on the membrane of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase to produce toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Bowler and Fluhr, 2000 ; Gilroy et al., 2014 ). ROS are reactive chemical species containing oxygen, such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radicals (OH·) and superoxide (O .− 2 ) ( Schopfer et al., 2001 ; Giorgio et al., 2007 ). Under normal condition, host cells typically maintain ROS at relatively low, sub-toxic levels. However, ROS levels can increase dramatically after the host recognizes pathogens ( Wojtaszek, 1997 ). Excessive production of ROS can cause oxidative damage to membrane lipids, proteins, other cellular molecules, and ultimately kill pathogens and host cells, which is known as hypersensitive response (HR) ( Bandyopadhyay et al., 1999 ). Therefore, the pathogen must be able to withstand the toxic ROS after penetrating the host cell. Pathogens have evolved strategies to overcome plant defense responses. For example, the filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler produces a unique host-selective toxin (HST) that kills host cells prior to invasion and nutrient acquisition ( Akimitsu et al., 2014 ; Tsuge et al., 2016 ). A. alternata consists of at least seven pathotypes, each of which can cause diseases in a variety of important crops, including Japanese pear, tangerine, apple, strawberry, rough lemon, tomato, and tobacco ( Akimitsu et al., 2014 ). Two distinct pathotypes of A. alternata have been found in citrus. One is the rough lemon pathotype of A. alternata, which produces host-selective ACRL toxin that is pathogenic to rough lemon ( Citrus jambhiri Lush) and Pangpur lime ( Citrus limonia Osbech), causing leaf spot ( Akimitsu et al., 1989 ; Peever et al., 1999 , 2004 ). The other is the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata, which produces a unique host-selective toxin called ACT toxin that causes brown spots on citrus leaves and fruits ( Kohmoto et al., 1991 ; Akimitsu et al., 2003 ; Huang et al., 2015 ). The tangerine pathotype of A. alternata is pathogenic to tangerines ( Citrus reticulata Blanco), grapefruit ( Citrus paradisi Merced.), their hybrids, as well as hybrids from tangerine and sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), but not toxic in rough lemon ( Ma et al., 2018 ). Previous studies have shown that at least seven ACTT genes are present in multiple copies of gene clusters on less than 2.0 Mb of the conditionally dispensable chromosome (CDC), which is essential for the biosynthesis of ACT toxin ( Tsuge et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). RNA silencing of any ACTT gene leads to no production of ACT toxin and loss of pathogenicity ( Miyamoto et al., 2008 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). Sulfur is an essential mineral element that plays an important role in many biological processes ( Kellogg et al., 1972 ). Sulfur is a crucial constituent of some amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine ( Brosnan and Brosnan, 2006 ). Methionine plays a critical role in various cellular metabolic pathways in all organisms ( Shoveller et al., 2005 ). For example, under the catalysis of methionine adenosyltransferase, methionine can bind to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to synthesize S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which is a key source of activated methyl groups in all organisms. It can also be served as a source of activated C3 aminopropyl units for polyamine biosynthesis in the cell cycle ( Wang et al., 2005 ). S-adenosyl methionine is the major methyl donor in biomethylation and involves in methyl transfer, transsulfurization and aminopropylation, which are required for cell growth and regeneration( Cantoni, 1975 ; Lu, 2000 ). Microorganisms, plants, and animals are different in terms of obtaining methionine. Plants and microorganisms can acquire mineral sulfur from the environment through the aspartate biosynthetic pathway and de novo synthesize methionine ( Ravanel et al., 2004 ). In contrast, animals cannot synthesize methionine and must acquire methionine from their diet ( Ball et al., 2006 ). As a result, the methionine biosynthetic pathway is a common target for antifungal agents because of the presence of methionine biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and absence in the animal kingdom. Ebelactone A is a beta-lactonease inhibitor that inhibits N-formylmethionine aminopeptidases on cell surface and stimulates host defense ( Paterson and Hulme, 1995 ). Another compound strongly affecting methionine biosynthesis is the antibiotic azoxybacillin, which is shown to induce five sulfate assimilation enzymes, especially ATP sulfurylase and homoserine transacetylase ( Jastrzębowska and Gabriel, 2015 ). In the present study, a homolog of the bZIP transcription factor MetR in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata was identified and functionally characterized to further understand the mechanism of methionine biosynthesis. Comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type and AaMetR disruption mutant ΔAaMetR was performed to provide a novel data for AaMetR-mediated regulation of gene expression in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata . The ΔAaMetR mutation perturb the expression of a large number of genes, including those associated with the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway. Most of the differentially expressed genes are up-regulated in the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathways in the ΔAaMetR mutant, suggesting that AaMetR plays a negative regulatory role in cysteine and methionine metabolism. 2 Methods 2.1 Fungal strains and culture conditions The reference A. alternata strain Z7, which was previously isolated from infected citrus in Zhejiang Province, China, was used as a wild-type strain in this work ( Huang et al., 2015 ). The strain Z7 and its derivative mutants were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (potato 200 g, glucose 20 g, and agar 20 g, per liter of purified water), V8 medium (V8 broth 200 mL, CaCO 3 3 g and agar 20 g, per liter of purified water), minimal medium (MM: KCl 0.5 g, NaNO 3 2 g, KH 2 PO 4 1 g, MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O 0.5 g, FeSO 4 0.01 g, Sucrose 10 g, Trace elements 200 μL and agar 20 g, per liter of purified water) and complete medium (CM: MM medium added with yeast extract 1 g, casein hydrolysate 1 g, and peptone 2 g, per liter of MM medium) at 25 °C to evaluate their growth and colony characteristics ( Hopwood, 1967 ). The trace elements solution consists of 5 g of ZnSO 4 , 5 g of citric acid, 0.25 g of CuSO 4 ·5H 2 O, and 1 g of (NH 4 ) 2 Fe(SO 4 ) 2 ·6H 2 O per 100 mL of purified water. For conidia collection, mycelia of 2-weeks-old culture of each strain on V8 medium was rubbed in 5 mL of sterile water. The conidia suspension was filtered with a layer of filter paper and calculated by hemocytometer under an optical microscope. 2.2 Identification and phylogenetic analysis of MetR in A. alternata To identify all bZIP transcription factors in A. alternata , the annotated genome sequence of A. alternata strain Z7 was downloaded from NCBI and used as the reference genome for data analysis. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles of the bZIP domains (PF00170) downloaded from Protein family (Pfam) ( http://pfam.xfam.org ) is employed as a query sequences against the genome of Z7 using HMMER 3.0 with default E-value ( Finn et al., 2009 ). Search results below the threshold e-value (<10 −4 ) were selected and their corresponding protein sequences were obtained from the Z7 genome. The homologous sequences of MetR from different fungi for phylogenetic analysis were downloaded from GenBank Sequence Database and the Fungal Transcription Factor Database (FTFD) ( Park et al., 2008 ). MEME SUITE program were used to identify protein domains ( Bailey et al., 2015 ). Multiple protein sequence alignment were carried out using ClustalW programs ( Chenna et al., 2003 ). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method with 1000 bootstrap replicates by MEGA7 software ( Kumar et al., 2016 ). 2.3 Quantitative RT-PCR of AaMetR gene To quantify the expression of AaMetR gene under different stress conditions, the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection Systems (Bio-Rad, USA). The fungus A. alternaria strain Z7 was cultivated in 150-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of liquid PDB medium (PDA without agar) and incubated at 25 °C on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm in the dark for two days. The two-days-old Z7 cultures were supplemented with different chemical or injured Ponkan leaves to obtain a final concentration of PDB only, 3 mM H 2 O 2 , 10 mM H 2 O 2 , the injured tangerine ( Citrus reticulata Blanco var. Ponkan ) Leaves, 10 mM FeSO4, 1 mM CuSO4, and 1 M NaCl, respectively. After incubation for 30 min, the treated mycelia of Z7 with different chemicals were immediately filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, freeze-dried and ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. Fungal RNA was extracted from each sample using the AxyPrep Multisource Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen Biotechnology, Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5 μg RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a HiScript II Q RT SuperMix Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). The Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection Systems was used for qRT-PCR with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. For each sample, all treatments were performed in triplicate. A. alternata actin gene was used as an endogenous control in this study. 2.4 Mutation and complementation of AaMetR AaMetR disruption mutants were generated by homologous recombination following protoplast transformation as previously described ( Yang and Chung, 2013 ). Briefly, two DNA fragments (5′ MetR ::5′ HYG and 3′ MetR ::3′ HYG ) overlapped with the hygromycin phosophotransferase gene (HYG) cassette were constructed separately by fusion PCR. Two purified fragments were transformed into protoplasts of A. alternaria strain Z7 using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and CaCl 2 ( Yang and Chung, 2013 ). The transformants were cultured on PDA medium amended with 100 ug/mL hygromycin. To identify transformants carrying the mutation, the resistant transformants were screened by PCR using the inner and flanking primers of the HYG and MetR genes. For AaMetR gene complementation, a 3.6 kb DNA fragment containing AaMetR promoter and AaMetR gene was PCR amplified and cloned to the linearized pA1300-NEO vector by recombination method using ClonExpress II (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). After confirming the integrity of the recombinant plasmid by sequencing, the plasmid containing AaMetR gene were transformed into the protoplasts of ΔAaMetR . Transformants were selected on the MM medium amended with 3 mM H 2 O 2 and the H 2 O 2 resistant transformants were examined by PCR. MM medium amended with H 2 O 2 was used as a selective medium, because further studies indicated that the ΔAaMetR mutant was hypersensitive to H 2 O 2 and could not grow on MM medium. All the primers used in this study are listed in the supplementary table S1. 2.5 Characterization of the ΔAaMetR To test the methionine auxotrophic phenotype, A. alternaria wild-type strain Z7, ΔAaMetR mutant AaMetR1 , AaMetR2 and complementary strain ΔAaMetR / MetR were inoculated on PDA, V8 and MM media supplemented with 3.0 mM and 10.0 mM L-methionine supplementation and cultured at 25 °C in the dark for 5 days. To examine the vegetative growth under oxidative stress, wild-type strain Z7, ΔAaMetR mutant AaMetR1 , AaMetR2 and complementary strain ΔAaMetR / MetR were inoculated on PDA plates containing 3 mM H 2 O 2 , 1 mM Cumyl hydroperoxide (CHP) and 2 mM Diethyl maleate (DEM), respectively. The diameter of fungal colonies was measured after culturing at 25 °C for 5 days. All growth assays were repeated twice, with three replicates per treatment. To investigate whether AaMetR is required for conidia formation, 2-weeks-old cultures of each strain on PDA medium were flooded with sterile water and scraped with glass rod under sterile condition. Since ΔAaMetR mutant is unable to grow on V8 and MM medium, we examined the 2-weeks-old culture on PDA medium. 2.6 Pathogenicity assay Fungal virulence was evaluated by placing 5 mm mycelial plug from PDA medium on detached leaves of tangerine ( Citrus reticulata Blanco var. Ponkan ) and Hongjv ( Citrus tangerina Hort.Ex Tanaka ). After inoculation, leaves were placed in a humidified plastic box and incubated at 25 °C for 3 days to observe the development of disease symptoms. We tested at least 30 leaves per strain, and the entire experiment was repeated twice. To assess whether ΔAaMetR regained its virulence after supplementation with exogenous methionine, ΔAaMetR was grown on PDA medium amended with 3.0 mM methionine, then inoculated on tangerine leaves, and wild-type Z7 and ΔAaMetR grown on methionine-free PDA medium were used as control. 2.7 RNA-seq For transcriptome analysis, ten mycelial plugs (5 mm in diameter) excised the margins of 4-day-old colonies of ΔAaMetR as well as wild-type strain Z7 were transferred into 150 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL PDB medium and shaken at 180 rpm on a rotary shaker in the dark at 25 °C for 2 days. The mycelium produced in PDB was filtered, freeze-dried, frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using AxyPrepTM Multi-Source Total RNA Miniprepkit (Axygen, USA). RNA degradation was monitored on 1% agarose gel. RNA purity was checked using the NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA) and its concentration measured using Qubit RNA Assay Kit on Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA-seq libraries were performed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina Inc., USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transcriptome sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (Illumina Inc., USA). RNA-Seq was performed for three biological replicates of each sample. The genome of A. alternata Z7 downloaded from GenBank was employed as the reference genome. Poor-quality reads and adapter were trimmed using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 ) and the cleaned reads were subsequently mapped to the reference genome using Bowtie ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 ) and TopHat ( Trapnell et al., 2009 ). Mapped reads were transformed into a count matrix with rows of gene and columns of sample using htseq-count to quantify gene expression levels ( Anders et al., 2015 ). DESeq2 R package was used to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes under two conditions with a preset p-value lower than a threshold 0.001 as well as log 2 fold change higher than a threshold 1.5 ( Love et al., 2014 ). Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and functional term mapping were performed using Blast2GO software ( Conesa et al., 2005 ). The GO annotation results were classified to categories using Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot (WEGO) ( Ye et al., 2006 ). Secondary metabolite (SM) biosynthesis gene clusters was identified in A. alternata Z7 genome by antiSMASH 4.0 ( Blin et al., 2017 ). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and SM gene clusters were plotted using Circos ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 ). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed for mapping enzymes onto known metabolic pathways ( Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 ). 2.8 Quantitative RT-PCR The RNAs of wide-type strain Z7 and ΔAaMetR were used for quantitative RT-PCR to verify the transcriptome data obtained by RNA-Seq. A total of 20 randomly selected A. alternata genes were tested on Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection Systems (Bio-Rad, USA). 5 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using Vazyme ChamQ SYBR Green qPCR master Mix Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). The qRT-PCR reaction with a volume of 20 μL was composed of template cDNA 20 ng, 0.8 μM of primers, and 10 μL of ChamQ SYBR Green qPCR master Mix. The reaction procedure was initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. For each sample, all treatments were performed in triplicate. A. alternata actin gene was used as an endogenous control in this study. 3 Results 3.1 Identification and characterization of MetR in A. alternata To identify MetR homologs in A. alternata, we used HMMER3 with the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of the bZIP domain (PF00170) to query the whole genome of A. alternata Z7. The sequence of Mocys-3 (MGG 14561, XM_003709705.1) and its protein sequence (XP_003709753.1) in Magnaporthe oryzae were used for comparison. We identified a single gene Aa03030 in A. alternata Z7 with a predicted bZIP domain, and its product shared 52% amino acid identity with MoCys-3 homolog of M. oryzae (Fig. S1). The Aa03030 gene contains an 855 bp open reading frame interrupted by a single 333 bp intron, encoding a protein containing 284 amino acids. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of MetR homologs from different fungi confirmed that they shared a highly conserved bZIP domain, and Aa03030 was most similar to bZIP_Ab0007 of A. brassicicola ( Fig. 1 ). We tentatively designated this gene AaMetR . 3.2 Oxidative and abiotic stress modifies AaMetR expression in A. alternata The expression level of AaMetR gene in the A. alternata wild-type strain Z7 is different under different environmental stresses. In brief, the expression of AaMetR was up-regulated under the conditions of 3 mM H 2 O 2 , 10 mM H 2 O 2 , injured tangerine leaves, FeSO4, CuSO4, but down-regulated under the stress of NaCl. Among all conditions, A. alternata strain Z7 had the highest AaMetR expression in 10 mM H 2 O 2 . Oxidative stress and metal ion stress induce AaMetR to be up-regulated significantly. Similar to ROS stress, the expression of AaMetR gene in A. alternata was up-regulated under the stimulation of injured tangerine leaves ( Fig. 2 ). 3.3 Targeted disruption of AaMetR in A. alternata Reverse genetics strategy was implemented to investigate the role of AaMetR gene in abiotic stress tolerance. The AaMetR gene was disrupted with a split marker protocol using two DNA fragments overlapping in the hygromycin selection marker (5′ AaMetR ::5′ HYG and 3′ AaMetR ::3′ HYG ) ( Fig. 3 A). This protocol showed up to 100% gene disruption efficiency in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata ( Lin et al., 2009 ; Yang and Chung, 2013 ). The transformation of wild-type Z7 protoplasts with two overlapping DNA fragments resulted in more than 40 hygromycin resistant transformants. The disruption of AaMetR gene was confirmed by PCR using outside primers pairs ( Fig. 3 B) and inside primers flanking the insertion site and included an annealing site upstream of the 5′ recombination target ( Fig. 3 C). Using an upstream primer with one internal to the deleted AaMetR fragment did not amplified a PCR product in either of the putative mutants, but amplified a PCR product from wild-type DNA consistent with gene disruption ( Fig. 3 C). Cmplementary analysis was conducted to confirm that the observed phenotype was due to the disruption of AaMetR gene. A recombinant plasmid pA1300-NEO vector containing AaMetR gene and the promoter was introduced into protoplasts of the mutant AaMetR1 . Presumptive complementary transformants were screened on the MM medium amended with 3 mM H 2 O 2 and verified by PCR amplification ( Fig. 3 B and C). The complementary strain was named ΔAaMetR/MetR . 3.4 AaMetR is involved in vegetative growth The growth of ΔAaMetR mutant were significantly different from wild-type on PDA, V8 and MM medium. A. alternata wild-type Z7 grew well on all four media, while AaMetR1 and AaMetR2 were only able to grow on PDA and CM. The ΔAaMetR mutant could not grow on V8 and MM media ( Figs. 4 and 5 A ). Furthermore, the colony morphology of ΔAaMetR mutant were distinct from the wild-type strain on PDA. On PDA medium, the colony of wild-type strain Z7 was initially light brown, then turned brown to dark brown within 3–5 days, producing abundant aerial hyphae. In contrast, the ΔAaMetR mutant consistently produced white to pale colonies without aerial hyphae (Fig. S2). After introducing the AaMetR gene, the complementary strain ΔAaMetR / MetR was able to grow on all four media and exhibited colony morphology similar to wild-type, indicating that the aberrant morphological phenotypes were caused by AaMetR disruption ( Figs. 4 and 5 A). 3.5 AaMetR contributes to conidia formation To assess conidia formation, conidia were harvested from two-weeks-old cultures of each strain on V8 medium with 3 mL of water. Under optical microscope, wild-type strain Z7 produces conidia in long chains, characterized by pale to light brown in color, with a beak, and muriform septation ( Fig. 6 ). The conidia yield of wild-type was approximately 3.2 ± 1.4 × 10 5 conidia/mL ( Fig. 5 D). In contrast, ΔAaMetR mutant could not produce any conidia on V8 and PDA medium. After reintroduction of AaMetR gene, the complemented strain ΔAaMetR / MetR regained the ability to produce conidia, yielding 2.0 ± 0.7 × 10 5 conidia/mL on PDA with two-week-old colonies ( Fig. 5 D). These results indicate that AaMetR is required for mycelial growth conidial production. To determine whether the mutant phenotype can be complemented by exogenous methionine, ΔAaMetR mutant were inoculated on PDA, V8 and MM plates supplemented with 3 mM methionine. Both AaMetR1 and AaMetR2 were able to grow on V8 and MM media supplemented with 3 mM and 10 mM L-methionine. The colony morphology was similar to that of wild-type strain Z7 ( Figs. 4 and 5 B). A large number of conidia of ΔAaMetR mutant were observed on PDA and V8 media supplemented with 3 mM L-methionine, indicating that AaMetR is essential for methionine biosysthesis ( Figs. 5 D and 6 ). 3.6 AaMetR is required for fungal virulence To determine whether AaMetR is involved in the pathogenicity of A. alternata on tangerine, thirty detached tangerine leaves were inoculated with 5-days-old mycelial plugs of the wild-type strain Z7, AaMetR1 , AaMetR2 and the complemented strain ΔAaMetR / MetR . Three days after inoculation, symptoms with circular to irregular brown necrosis were fully developed on detached citrus leaves inoculated with the wild-type strain Z7, but no lesion were observed on the leaves inoculated with ΔAaMetR mutant ( Fig. 7 A and B). The loss of pathogenicity was complemented in ΔAaMetR / MetR . To further investigate the loss-of-pathogenicity due to the inability of the ΔAaMetR mutant to penetrate the host cells, wound inoculation experiments were conducted on detached tangerine leaves. Three days after inoculation, symptoms with brown spot were observed on the wound tangerine leaves inoculated with wild-type strain Z7. However, no visible symptoms were observed on wounded leaves inoculated with AaMetR mutant. Therefore, our results demonstrated that the disruption of AaMetR gene leaded to the complete loss of virulence of A. alternata . To further investigate the loss of pathogenicity of ΔAaMetR mutant due to the observed methionine auxotrophy, we inoculated detached tangerine leaves with 5-days-old mycelial plugs of ΔAaMetR mutant grown on PDA amended with 3 mM L-methionine. We used wild-type and ΔAaMetR mutant without methionine supplementation as control. Three days after inoculation, typical symptoms of brown spot were observed on detached leaves inoculated with wild-type strain Z7 as well as the ΔAaMetR mutant grown with methionine supplementation. The detached leaves inoculated with ΔAaMetR mutant without methionine supplementation were asymptomatic. Although the lesions induced by the ΔAaMetR mutant with methionine supplementation were less than that caused by the wild-type strain Z7 ( Fig. 7 C and D). This experiment suggests that the loss of pathogenicity in the ΔAaMetR mutant is caused by a defect in methionine biosysthesis. The ΔAaMetR mutant partially restored their virulence after supplementation with extraneous methionine. 3.7 AaMetR is crucial for resistance to oxidative stress To investigate whether MetR is participated in the oxidative stress resistance and salt stress, A. alternata wild-type strain Z7, ΔAaMetR mutant AaMetR1 , AaMetR2 , and ΔAaMetR/MetR were inoculated onto PDA plates supplemented with 3 mM H 2 O 2 , 1 mM Cumyl hydroperoxide (CHP), 2 mM Diethyl maleate (DEM), and 1 M NaCl. The mycelial growth of the ΔAaMetR mutant was significantly affected by oxidizing agents H 2 O 2 , CHP, DEM, and NaCl. H 2 O 2 and CHP completely inhibited fungal growth of the ΔAaMetR mutant on PDA. In contrast, growth of the wild-type fungus did not appear to be impacted by the supplements ( Figs. 4 and 5 C). Complementation of AaMetR mutation restored the ability of the ΔAaMetR mutant to withstand the induced oxidative stress confirming that loss of AaMetR function confers oxidative stress sensitivity. 3.8 Transcription profiling of AaMetR by RNA sequencing RNA-seq was implemented to identify genes differentially expressed in AaMetR mutant, which may be the downstream of the putative transcription factor. Illumina libraries were constructed from AaMetR1 and wild-type Z7 and sequenced them on the HiSeq platform. In total, 122,477,108 and 125,603,640 reads were obtained from the RNA-Seq libraries of AaMetR1 and wild-type Z7. Of these, 107,023,771 and 110,948,646 reads were uniquely mapped to the reference genome of Z7, accounting for 87.38% and 88.33% mapping rate for AaMetR1 and wild-type Z7, respectively. The absolute value of log 2 ratio ≥ 1.5 and FDR ≤ 0.001 was used as the threshold. In total, more than 2042 genes met these criteria and were considered to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the 2042 DEGs, 956 were up-regulated and 1086 were down-regulated in the mutant AaMetR1 compared to the wild-type ( Figs. 8 and 9 ). Quantitative RT-PCR experiment was performed to verify the results of RNA-Seq. Twenty genes were randomly selected and validated. Although there is a slightly difference in folding changes, each gene expression pattern was consistent with the gene expression pattern in the RNA-Seq data ( Fig. 10 ). In total, 127 SM gene clusters were identified in the genome of A. alternata Z7 using antiSMASH 4.0. A custom Perl script was used to screen the gene cluster which at least 3 genes are upregulated or downregulated with a log2FC≥2.0 and the average value of log2FC ≥1.0 (Sum of log2FC /Number of genes ≥ 1.0). Overall, 21 gene clusters showed considerable upregulated or downregulated in ΔAaMetR mutant. The transcript level of cluster4 was significantly downregulated in ΔAaMetR mutant, indicating there may be positive regulation cechanism between AaMetR and cluster4. Among those genes, Aa00442, Aa00443, and Aa00444 belong to Cytochrome P-450 family, which is involved in the toxication of toxic substances and steroids and fatty acids. Aa00444 encodes a FAD/FMN-dependent oxygenase/oxidase. Aa00446 encodes PksC, which is responsble for polyketide synthase. Therefore, AaMetR showed extensive regulation of the secondary metabolite (SM) biosynthesis gene clusters ( Fig. 11 ). Of all DEGs, 841 up-regulated genes and 821 down-regulated genes were categorized into 49 GO groups. The genes were enriched significantly within 29 GO term, including organic substance metabolic process (772 genes), primary metabolic process (739), cellular metabolic process (704), nitrogen compound metabolic process (665), organic cyclic compound binding (521), heterocyclic compound binding (520), ion binding (509), biosynthetic process (477), hydrolase activity (377), small molecule binding (303), establishment of localization (300), oxidation-reduction process (291), oxidoreductase activity (289), transferase activity (282), regulation of biological process (226), regulation of cellular process (217), small molecule metabolic process (211), carbohydrate derivative binding (197), cellular component organization (194), drug binding (181), cofactor binding (164), cellular component biogenesis (163), regulation of metabolic process (158), cellular response to stimulus (139), catalytic activity, acting on a protein (129), transmembrane transporter activity (110), protein binding (108), structural constituent of ribosome (104), response to stress (89) ( Fig. 12 ). A total of 798 genes were mapped to the KEGG pathways, and the top 20 pathways in enrichment degree are listed ( Fig. 13 ). The pathways with significant enrichment including, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (18 genes), Cysteine and methionine metabolism (13), Proteasome (11), Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis (10), Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (10), Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (10), Glutathione metabolism (9), Arginine biosynthesis (9), Nitrogen metabolism (8), Lysine biosynthesis (8), Butanoate metabolism (8), Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis (7), Quorum sensing (6), Vitamin B6 metabolism (5), Antifolate resistance (5), Selenocompound metabolism (5), Carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes (5), Sulfur relay system (4), Synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies (4), C5-Branched dibasic acid metabolism (3). 3.9 AaMetR affect several critical genes in cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway As shown in the KEGG pathway enrichment scatter plot, AaMetR significantly affects cysteine and methionine metabolism (ko00270), which contains the greatest number of differentially expressed genes in all DEGs-enriched pathways. Twelve DEGs were mapped to the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway by log 2 ratio ≥ 1.5, 9 of which were differentially expressed by a log 2 ratio ≥ 2.0 ( Fig. 14 ). AaMetR significantly affects Aa10494 ( msrC , K08968), Aa01849 ( asd , K00133), Aa07778 (K00826), Aa01614 ( MetX , K00641), Aa06258 ( MetB , K01739), Aa05306 ( MetC , K01760), Aa00053 ( speE , K00797), Aa05948 ( MetE , K00549), Aa10458 (K00641), Aa05569 (K00003) and Aa08024 (K17989). Among these genes, Aa05306 is a MetC ortholog (cystathionine beta-lyase), which converts L-cystathionine to homocysteine. Aa05948 is a MetE ortholog, which is involved in catalyzing homocysteine to methionine. Aa10494 is an ortholog of msrC (methionine sulfoxide reductase C) that is involved in oxidative stress response and is specific for repairing free methionine sulfoxide. After disrupting AaMetR gene in A. alternata , the log 2 ratio value of msrC was 5.28-folds compare with wild-type. Another important gene that MetR affected is MetB , which is cystathionine y-synthase, the second enzyme of methionine biosynthetic pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that AaMetR perturb the expression of a large number of genes, including several crucial genes involved in the cysteine and methionine metabolism. Most of the genes are up-regulated in the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway in the ΔAaMetR mutant, indicating that AaMetR plays a crucial role in cysteine and methionine metabolism. 4 Discussion The present study identified a homolog of the methionine biosynthesis regulator MetR, designated AaMetR, and further investigated the key role of this bZIP transcription factor in regulating methionine metabolism. Similar to other homologs of the bZIP transcription factor family, AaMetR contains a conserved leucine zipper (bZIP) domain and several conserved motifs that are critical for binding to the promoter region of the gene and regulating their expression. By analyzing the loss of function and complementation of AaMetR gene, we found that AaMetR gene is required for methionine metabolism, vegetative growth, conidial formation, pathogenicity and anti-oxidative stress. This work further demonstrated that the citrus pathogen A. alternata utilizes a complex pathway that modulates methionine biosynthesis through transcriptome analysis of the ΔAaMetR mutant and the wide-type strain Z7. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to quantify AaMetR expression under various stress condition, including H 2 O 2 , the injured tangerine leaves, FeSO4, CuSO4 and NaCl. The injured tangerine leaves are used to stimulate A. alternata , because after the plant is infected by microorganisms, NADPH oxidase can utilizes molecular electrons provided by NADPH to catalyze molecular oxygen (O 2 ) to superoxide anion (O 2− ), and then converted to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Therefore, the injured tangerine leaves can be used to stimulate A. alternata and to determine gene expression during the pathogen infecting the host plant. Compared to A. alternata wild-type Z7 in PDB, the expression of AaMetR gene was up-regulated at different levels of oxidative stress, metal ionic stress and injured tangerine leaves, implicating that the bZIP transcription factor AaMetR may be involved in the regulation of genes in responding to the exogenous oxidative stress. The ability of detoxified host-generating ROS is critical in the infection and colonization of pathogenic microorganisms. After disrupting AaMetR gene in A. alternata , the mutant became hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and various ROS-generating agents. The ΔAaMetR mutant was unable to grow on PDA medium containing 3 mM H 2 O 2 and other ROS-generating oxidants. ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) are by-products of aerobic metabolism, which are mainly generated by mitochondria and NADPH oxidases. Previous studies have demonstrated that NADPH oxidase components, including NoxA, NoxB and NoxR, are involved in the resistance to oxidative stress ( Yang and CHUNG, 2012 ,2013). A. allternata lacking NoxA , NoxB and NoxR genes displayed a slightly increased sensitivity to oxidants. Only double disrupting mutants lacking NoxA / NoxB or NoxA / NoxR genes exhibited significant sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )[41]. The ROS sensitivity phenotype of ΔAaMetR mutant is similar to that of the GPx3 , Yap1 and hog1 mutants, but more severe than any of these mutants ( Lin et al., 2009 ; Lin and Chung, 2010 ). Deletion of ap1 , hog1 , or GPx3 in A. allternata caused a considerable decrease in mycelial growth under oxidative stress. However, the ap1 and hog1 mutants were still able to grow on the PDA media containing H 2 O 2 and other ROS-generating oxidants, albeit much slower than wide-type. In contrast, A. alternata lacking AaMetR was unable to survive on PDA medium containing 3 mM H 2 O 2 . It appears that AaMetR significantly affects the ability to resist oxidative stress in A. alternata . Our study demonstrated that AaMetR is required for the pathogenicity of the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata. When pathogens invade a host plant, the level of ROS in the host cell increase dramatically, which kills the invading pathogen. However, microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to detoxify the ROS generated by host plants ( Apel and Hirt, 2004 ). AaMetR expression in wild-type A. alternata was significantly up-regulated in response to citrus leaves tangerine stimulation, which suggests that AaMetR may be involved in ROS response and host-pathogen interaction. Virulence assays demonstrate that the ΔAaMetR mutant is unable to induce necrotic lesions on detached citrus leaves, further confirming that AaMetR is required for the pathogenicity. Previous studies have demonstrated that MoMetR, the M. oryzae ortholog of AaMetR was essential for virulence of M. oryzae on rice [43]. However, the pathogenesis of M. oryzae and A. alternata is different. Many factors can affect the virulence of pathogenic fungi including the environment, host genotype, and the pathogen itself. In A. alternata , ROS detoxification and ACT toxin synthesis have been reported to be two critical factors that influence pathogenicity. Dysfunction of any ACTT genes of CDC could prevent ACT toxin secretion leading to loss-of-pathogenicity in A. alternata . AaMetR null mutants failed to induce necrotic lesions on both detached wounded and unwounded citrus leaves. The loss of pathogenicity by AaMetR null mutants may be due to their inability to resist or otherwise detoxify the ROS produced by host plant. ΔAaMetR mutant regain pathogenicity after complementation of AaMetR gene or after receiving methionine supplementation from media. The results of present study demonstrate that MetR plays a crucial role in vegetative growth and conidiogenesis. ΔAaMetR mutant could not grow on either V8 or MM media, and grew poorly on PDA when compared with wild-type strain Z7. It would probably be worth noting somewhere in the manuscript the differences between the different media types. The colorless mycelia suggest that ΔAaMetR mutant produce less of the black pigment melanin than wild-type fungus. Intriguingly, the rice pathogen Magnaporthe grisea requires melanization of its appressoria development and host penetration ( Howard and Ferrari, 1989 ). Unlike M. grisea , the appressoria of A. alternata is colorless and melanin is not required for appressoria development or host penetration ( Kawamura et al., 1997 ). Conidiogenesis is an important mechanism for the dispersal of A. alternata . The conidia of A. alternata in the field can be spread widely by wind and rain. Our study demonstrates that MetR is required for conidia formation. While wild-type Z7 produces typical Alternaria brown conidia, the ΔAaMetR mutant could not produce conidia on either PDA or CM media. The AaMetR mutant , however, produced wild-type levels of conidia the media supplemented with methionine indicating that methionine is required for conidiogenesis. In order to candidate methionine metabolism and oxidative stress resistance genes that are downstream of AaMetR transcription factor, we identified the differentially expressed genes in AaMetR mutant. In total, we identified 2042 genes with transcription levels log 2 FC ≥ 1.5 different from wild-type. Several of these genes, including MsrC , MetB , MetC , MetE and MetX were up-regulated, suggesting the genes in the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway were regulated by MetR . Previous studies have shown MsrC plays an important role in the oxidative stress response of Salmonella Typhimurium ( Denkel et al., 2011 , 2013 ). ΔmsrC mutant of S. Typhimurium could not survive when exposed to H 2 O 2 , and were unable to grow in either macrophages or in mice. Another important gene in this pathway MetR have affected is MetB , which is cystathionine y-synthase, the second enzyme of methionine biosynthetic pathway. 5 Conclusions In summary, our work functionally characterized the A. alternata AaMetR as a global regulator in methionine biosynthesis, which also contributes to oxidative stress tolerance. This work highlights the role of AaMetR in regulation of conidia formation, ROS detoxification, mycelial growth and fungal pathogenicity in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata . Transcriptomics analysis was used to identify candidate genes that AaMetR might regulate. Our data demonstrate that AaMetR is essential for the fungal pathogen to infect its host. This study contributes to our understanding of the relationship of methionine biosynthesis and oxidative stress response.
