    "full_text": "The false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta , is a major quarantine pest native to Africa. Physical postharvest phytosanitary measures such as cold and heat treatments are championed to control its spread to new regions. However, the molecular changes that T. leucotreta undergoes as it attempts to adjust to its surroundings during the treatments and withstand the extreme temperatures remain largely unknown. The current study employs RNA-seq using the next-generation Illumina HiSeq platform to produce transcriptome profiles for differential gene expression analysis of T. leucotreta larvae under thermal stress. The transcriptome assembly analysis revealed 226,067 transcripts, clustering into 127,018 unigenes. In comparison to the 25 °C treated group, 874, 91, 159, and 754 individual differentially expressed genes (DEGs) co-regulated at −10, 0, 40, and 50 °C, respectively were discovered. Annotation of the DEGs by gene ontology (GO) revealed several genes, previously implicated in low and high-temperature stresses, including heat shock proteins, cytochrome P450, cuticle proteins, odorant binding proteins, and immune system genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics (KEGG) classification analysis revealed that substantive DEGs were those involved in metabolic pathways such as thiamine, purine, folate, and glycerolipid metabolism pathways. The RT-qPCR validation of several significantly up- and down-regulated DEGs showed congruence between RNA-seq and qPCR data. This baseline study lays a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying T. leucotreta 's cold/heat tolerance by providing a thorough differential gene expression analysis that has identified multiple genes that may be associated with the insect's ability to withstand cold and heat."

          "False codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is an important phytosanitary and quarantine pest of a wide range of fruits and vegetables, native to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) ( Stibick et al., 2010 ). The larva feeds on >100 host plant species including agriculturally vital crops like cotton, avocados, guavas, peaches, citrus, grapes, Rosa spp., and Solanaceous plants such as Capsicum ( EPPO, 2019 ; Mutyambai et al., 2020 ). The pest restricts the production and trade of most fresh commodities due to the polyphagous nature of its larvae. Therefore, for effective management of T. leucotreta , it is recommended to implement both preharvest and postharvest control strategies. Consequently, in Africa, the vast majority of farmers employ chemical pesticides pre-harvest, to manage this invasive insect ( Mutyambai et al., 2020 ; Adom et al., 2021 ). However, continuous unregulated pesticide use is not only untenable and uneconomical, but it also leads to export produce interceptions due to the presence of higher levels of pesticide residues in the fresh produce that exceed the internationally permitted maximum residue levels ( Fernandes et al., 2019 ). Hence, to reduce vulnerability to invasion and establishment by T. leucotreta in new regions, phytosanitary regulations in several international markets recommend using safe postharvest treatments to control T. leucotreta in various fresh commodities before acceptance ( EPPO, 2021 ; Li et al., 2022 ). Physical control methods, such as cold and heat treatments, are commonly used among the various postharvest treatment options available because they are more environmentally friendly than hazardous chemical treatments that pose safety and health risks ( IPPC, 2018 ; Pongener et al., 2018 ; Mwando et al., 2022 ). The ability of T. leucotreta larvae to survive and execute activity under diverse thermal conditions varies greatly with exposure temperature. Previous studies indicate that T. leucotreta larvae can survive temperatures as low as below −10 °C and as high as 52 °C, for at least an hour, depending on the stage of the larval instar ( Boardman et al., 2012 ; Terblanche et al., 2017 ). Thus, several studies have explored T. leucotreta 's thermal survival/mortality to design cold/heat phytosanitary treatment protocols ( Moore et al., 2017 ; Mwando et al., 2022 ). The treatments (cold/heat) ensure efficacious results in eliminating T. leucotreta in fresh produce before export, if well-developed and optimally administered. In contrast, if the treatment schedule is not strictly followed, some T. leucotreta may develop tolerance and survive the cold/heat treatment ( Moore and Hattingh, 2016 ; Moore and Manrakhan, 2022 ).",
          "Thermal tolerance in insects is critical for survival, development, reproduction, and their response to physical postharvest treatments ( Jensen et al., 2007 ; Terblanche et al., 2017 ). Temperature treatments may initiate both biochemical and physiological changes in the insect as it attempts to adapt to the new environment ( Rivers, 2008 ; González-Tokman et al., 2020 ). The T. leucotreta , like any other insect, employs a variety of mechanisms, including change in metabolism, promotion of stress responses such as the synthesis and use of heat shock proteins and activation of other molecular adaptations, to cope with either high or low-temperature stress ( Stotter and Terblanche, 2009 ; Terblanche et al., 2017 ). Similarly, T. leucotreta larvae have been shown to have high variability within and among thermal tolerance estimates, allowing them to survive a wider range of temperatures ( Terblanche et al., 2017 ). However, the molecular mechanism by which T. leucotreta uses thermotolerance to withstand these treatments is largely unknown. Understanding T. leucotreta 's molecular responses as a thermotolerance strategy to either acute high or low temperatures may aid in deciphering survival and mortality factors at the laboratory and field levels.",
          "To fully comprehend the physiological adaptation processes in insects, an extensive comparative study of gene expression regulation under heat stress is necessary. Next Generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), for example, can reveal in-depth details about an organism's transcriptional landscape ( Wang et al., 2009 ; Lowe et al., 2017 ). This method can be used to catalogue and quantify the entire set of transcripts for a particular tissue, developmental stage, or physiological condition in response to a specific stress ( Costa-Silva et al., 2017 ). In this regard, specific gene expression changes in response to temperature stress in a range of insect species have previously been investigated using RNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly ( Lü and Huo, 2018 ; Xiong et al., 2019 ; Vatanparast et al., 2021 ; Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). Consequently, RNA-seq enables researchers to study genes involved in signaling, putative functions that are activated, and pathways in insects under low- and high-temperature stress. De novo transcriptome assembly has also made it possible to examine how distinct differential gene expression occurs in response to a particular treatment in non-model insects (without reference genomes) ( Eldem et al., 2017 ) .",
          "To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive research has examined the transcriptomes of T. leucotreta in response to extreme temperature treatments. Therefore, in this study, we used transcriptomics to identify differences in gene expression patterns in thermally treated T. leucotreta. The study's specific goals were to (1) sequence and assemble a transcriptome reference from RNA-Seq data from T. leucotreta exposed to various temperature treatments, (2) estimate expression levels for each transcript in each sample, and (3) identify transcripts that are differentially expressed between samples, and the pathways involved. This study builds the foundation for the adaptive process and provides a wealth of information for finding and identifying novel genes involved in T. leucotreta 's responses to heat and cold stress. The understanding of T. leucotreta physiology at low and high temperatures could be used to improve the designing and development of effective physical postharvest phytosanitary treatment protocols."

              "False codling moths used in this study were reared at the Animal Rearing and Quarantine Unit (ARQU) of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology ( icipe ), Nairobi, Kenya. The T. leucotreta source colony was initially established in 2015 from field-collected adults and larvae from a citrus orange fruit orchards in Wote, Makueni county, Kenya (01°47′11.38″ S; 037°57′51.99″ E, 1236 m above sea level). Every three months, wild individuals were infused into the colony, which had been sustained for >50 generations. The colony was reared in cylindrical glass jars (12 x 6 cm), corked with ventilated lids, at 26 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 10 % RH, and a 12:12 (L:D) h cycle, on an artificial diet as described by Moore et al. (2014) . To perform transcriptome analysis, third instar larvae were incubated at two cold temperature treatments i.e., −10 °C and 0 °C, and two heat treatments i.e. 40 °C and 50 °C in a temperature chamber (MIR-554 Cooled Incubator, PHC Europe B.V., Nijverheidsweg, The Netherlands) with a variance of 0.5 °C. A temperature recorder (Brannan-13/420/3 Digital thermo-hygrometer, Cumbria, England) was used to check the output temperature of the incubator. For each treatment, 30 third-instar larvae were collected in sterile Petri dishes (100 mm diameter) and placed under respective treatment temperatures for 1 h and allowed to recover at ambient room temperature (25 °C) for 1 h. The larvae then were gently stimulated using a paintbrush to determine if they were still alive. They were considered dead if they did not respond to prodding, with a controlled muscular response. The control treatment larvae were held at room temperature for the same period. Each treatment was replicated three times. After the temperature treatment, the live larvae were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction."

              "Before de novo transcriptome assembly, Trimmomatic (version 0.38) was used to filter the Illumina short reads to remove sequencing adapters, ambiguous nucleotides, and low-quality reads ( Bolger et al., 2014 ). Raw reads having a Phred score of base quality <20 and/or a length <50 bp were discarded. FastQC (version 0.11.9) was used to inspect the data quality before and after trimming ( Andrews, 2022 ). Quality-filtered reads were pooled from all replicates of each treatment to generate an Illumina-based de novo transcriptome assembly using Trinity (version 2.9.1) ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ). The total number of genes, transcripts, GC content, maximum/minimum/median/average contig length, and total assembled bases were calculated using the Fasta statistics tool ( Kyran, 2021 ). Using CD-HIT-EST (version 4.8.1), the longest assembled contigs were filtered and clustered into non-redundant transcripts ( Li and Godzik, 2006 ; Fu et al., 2012 ). The output transcripts (unigenes) were subsequently used for analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and annotating against several known sequence databases. The longest open reading frame (ORF) prediction for unigenes was performed using TransDecoder (version 5.5.0) ( Haas et al., 2013 ) to identify candidate coding regions within transcript sequences. After extracting ORFs of at least 100 amino acids in length, the TransDecoder estimated the likely coding areas. The completeness and quality of the de novo assembly were assessed with BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) (version 5.3.2), using three curated OrthoDB sets: Arthropoda, Insecta, and Lepidoptera ( Simão et al., 2015 ; Seppey et al., 2019 ). The BUSCO results were then plotted. The processed reads were mapped back to the raw transcriptome assembly after BUSCO evaluation to calculate the percentage of correctly mapped reads."

Using Bowtie2 (version 2.4.5), trimmed reads from each sample were aligned to the assembled reference, and the abundances of the unigenes across samples were estimated into the read count as an expression measure by the RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization) (version 1.3.2) algorithm using align read and estimate abundance tool ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ). Each transcript's normalized expression was estimated as fragments per kilobase transcript length per million fragments mapped (FPKM). Pairwise differential gene expression analysis among the treatments was performed using the Deseq2 method ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ), and all statistical tests were adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg's false discovery rate (FDR). To identify significant DEGs between treatments, extract, and cluster differentially expressed transcripts tool with viz. parameters; p -value cutoff for FDR of <0.05 and log 2 FC ≥ 2 or ≤ −2 was executed. Simple bar plots, Venn diagrams, and volcano plots were used to visualize the distribution of expression levels between the groups ( Heberle et al., 2015 ; Goedhart and Luijsterburg, 2020 ).

The result indicated that when exposed to high- and low-temperature stress, the DEGs of T. leucotreta primarily accumulate in pathways associated with energy metabolism ( Fig. 9 ) with T-10 and T50 DEGs being assigned to 53 and 80 KEGG pathways, respectively ( Fig. 9 A and B)."

              "Here, RT-qPCR was used to verify DEGs in RNA-seq data to validate the precision and reproducibility of the Illumina RNA-seq. Validation of nine DEGs from T50 in comparison to T25 was performed. This comprised of six up-regulated DEGs (heat shock protein 68-like, heat shock protein 70 family, cytochrome p 450 6B4, lipase 1-like, STAGA complex 65 subunit gamma-like, and neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit beta-3-like) and three down-regulated DEGs (macrophage mannose receptor 1-like, spod-11-tox b protein, and fatty acyl-CoA reductase wat-like). Similarly, in T-10, validation of seven DEGs, comprising four up-regulated DEGs (heat shock protein Hsp-12.2-like, larval cuticle protein A2B-like, myofilin isoform B, and cytochrome P450 4C1-like) and three DEGs that showed down-regulation (odorant binding protein, endocuticle structural glycoprotein SgAbd-5-like, and lipase 1-like) was performed. The results demonstrate that qPCR and Illumina FPKM changes in expression were in the same direction in both groups i.e. T50 ( Fig. 10 A and Supplementary Table S.6) and T-10 ( Fig. 10 B and Supplementary Table S.5). The Illumina sequencing results were congruent with the qPCR data with slight variations, confirming the transcriptome analysis's dependability and accuracy of RNA-Seq use in the study of genes involved in thermal tolerance in T. leucotreta ."

          "To better understand the molecular responses of an invasive insect pest to thermal stress, a detailed transcriptome analysis of the pest's gene expression regulation is crucial. The current study successfully sequenced, assembled a transcriptome reference from RNA-Seq data from the T. leucotreta thermal (cold and heat) treated samples, estimated expression levels for each transcript in each sample, identified transcripts that were differentially expressed between the samples, and performed pathway enrichment analysis. The major challenge of RNA-Seq technology in non-model organisms is always assembling a high-quality reference transcript set from short reads ( Eldem et al., 2017 ). It is imperative therefore to assess the completeness of de novo assembly before proceeding with downstream analyses. In this study, after filtering and clustering the assembled transcripts into non-redundant transcripts (unigenes), the length distribution of unigenes closely followed the length distribution of transcripts. Similarly, the transcriptome had high BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) completeness scores with at least 83 % of BUSCO genes in the three curated OrthoDB sets: Arthropoda (92.2 %), Insecta (90.9 %), and Lepidoptera (83.4 %) matching it, with very few missing or fragmented. Also, the transcriptome had more than an 80 % alignment rate. A transcriptome is considered to be of excellent quality if it contains >80 % of BUSCO genes and has a substantial majority (>80 %) of the reads (those used in its construction) mapping/aligning to the assembly ( Simão et al., 2015 ; Seppey et al., 2019 ). This implies that our transcript set was of high quality and thus suitable and reliable for use in subsequent downstream analyses.",
          "The T. leucotreta larvae like any other insect species, use a variety of molecular response strategies to aid in thermotolerance ( Ran et al., 2020 ), including transcriptional co-regulation (both up and down-regulation) of key genes that participate in the physiological process of low or high-temperature tolerance. The gene expression of T. leucotreta differed significantly between the control (25 °C) and thermally treated samples in this study. This implies that several genes were co-regulated in response to these cold and heat treatments. Our results show that the greater the difference between the thermal treatment temperature and the control temperature (25 °C), the greater the number of expressed unigenes, with extreme temperatures of −10 and 50 °C having the largest number of expression changes in unigenes (1223 and 1047, respectively) when compared to other temperature treatments of 0 and 40 °C (372 and 342, respectively) that were close to the control (25 °C). Similarly, more genes were significantly up-regulated at −10 °C (893) and 50 °C (552) treatments than at 0 °C (149) and 40 °C treatments (127) ( Fig. 4 ). This suggests that the expression of genes in T. leucotreta increases as the temperature shifts from the optimally ambient point. However, this is only possible up to a certain point, the critical thermal limits. Several other studies have found transcriptional changes in genes, particularly those involved in thermotolerance when the insect is subjected to thermal stress ( Xiong et al., 2019 ; Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). However, the number of DEGs and their levels of co-regulation (up or down) vary between insects. This is possibly due to differences in temperature, exposure time, and/or insect species.",
          "We validated and annotated the DEGs using gene ontology (GO), however, the vast majority of unigenes could not be linked to recognized genes, most likely due to the comparatively short length of the discrete gene sequences and the lack of T. leucotreta genome information. Nonetheless, when we compared transcriptome profiles for the annotated DEGs, we discovered several DEGs, including heat shock proteins, cytochrome P450, cuticle proteins, odorant binding proteins, and immune system genes that had previously been associated with cold and high-temperature stresses ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Xiong et al., 2019 ; Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones that promote proper folding and prevent irreversible denaturation of other essential proteins in the presence of thermal or other forms of stress ( Colinet et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ). In this study, low-temperature treatments resulted in the up-regulation of Hsp68 and Hsp12.2 while in heat treatment, Hsp68 and Hsp70 were up-regulated. Similarly, protein lethal (2) essential for life (l(2)efl) which encodes for the Hsp20 family was also up-regulated under high-temperature treatments . These findings are comparable to those of prior research that demonstrated that insects express HSPs in response to thermal stress, which links them to thermotolerance ( Štětina et al., 2015 ). For instance, to increase its thermotolerance, Frankliniella occidentalis , expressed Hsp70 more when under heat stress ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). Moreover, Stegobium paniceum significantly increased Hsp60 under high and low temperatures to help it withstand temperature stress ( Zhu et al., 2017 ). In desert beetles, Microdera punctipennis , three Hsp90 and four Hsp70 were up-regulated by cold stress. Similarly, there was an increase in Hsp70 and Hsp83 when red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta was exposed at 10 °C and 40 °C, respectively. Furthermore, HSPs have been linked to heat tolerance in Drosophila buzzatii lines selected for heat resistance ( Sørensen et al., 2003 ). Our study, like the previous studies, indicates that T. leucotreta co-regulates HSPs that play a critical role in thermotolerance by aiding in proper folding and preventing irreversible denaturation of other essential proteins. The differences in the expression of HSPs in organisms including insects however, could be due to factors such as insect species, sex of an organism, and intensity of temperature ( Zhou et al., 2019 ; Farahani et al., 2020 ). Similarly, insects may down-regulate the expression of some HSPs as a strategy to reduce the energy requirements for heat shock response caused by continuous thermal stress ( Wang et al., 2008 ; Li et al., 2012 ).",
          "In the current study, the chemosensory protein, CSP14, and odorant binding protein were down-regulated both in extremely low (−10 °C) and high (50 °C) temperatures. By binding and delivering odorant molecules to chemosensory/olfactory receptors (ORs) on olfactory neurons, these proteins play a role in insect chemosensory perception in the peripheral nerve system ( Younas et al., 2018 ; Waris et al., 2022 ). The down-regulation of these proteins suggests that the appropriate reaction of T. leucotreta to chemical cues in the environment is impaired under extreme temperatures. Previous studies indicate that temperature extremes and stress conditions such as starvation elicit changes in certain chemosensory proteins ( Jafari and Alenius, 2015 ; Vatanparast et al., 2021 ). Vatanparast and Park (2022) demonstrated that two odorant binding proteins ( OBP17 and OBP25 ) in Spodoptera frugiperda were down-regulated at high temperatures. However, there was an up-regulation in OBP25 when S. frugiperda was subjected to low temperature (4 °C). Similarly, under high temperature-acclimation conditions, four OBPs were discovered to be up-regulated and five were found to be down-regulated in the third antennal segments of Drosophila sp. ( Jafari and Alenius, 2015 ). The differences in the response of odorant binding protein to low temperatures are probably due to differences in insect species, exposure time, and intensity of the low temperatures in the separate studies. Hence, this study's acute temperature treatments (−10 and 50 °C) may have been extreme for T. leucotreta chemosensory protein to appropriately function.",
          "Cuticle proteins in insects perform a vital physiological role in conferring the physical properties of the exoskeleton such as barring the evaporation of water and acting as a barrier to the environment ( Zhao et al., 2017 ). Here, the expression of the cuticular protein varied depending on the temperature treatment. Cuticle protein 19.8-like and larval cuticle protein A2B-like were up-regulated after cold stress (−10 °C) while in heat treatment (50 °C), these proteins were down-regulated. There was however an up-regulation of larval cuticle protein LCP-30-like in heat treatment. Varied changes in cuticular protein gene expression in response to thermal stress have also been observed in studies of other insect species such as stick insects ( Dunning et al., 2013 ), planthoppers ( Huang et al., 2017 ), and moths ( Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). The co-regulation of cuticular protein genes in response to thermal stress in insects, therefore, differs depending on the temperature magnitude and exposure time.",
          "We found an overall up-regulation response of cytochrome p 450s (CYPs) to thermal treatment. There was an up-regulation of cytochrome p 450 6B5-like, 4V2-like, 4d2-like, 6B2-like, 6B6-like, 6B7-like, and 4C1-like in response to cold treatment and CYP 6B5-like and 9e2-like in response to heat treatment. The overall up-regulation in a significant number of CYP p450 both at low and high temperatures is an indication that thermal stress increases oxidative stress in the insect body. These findings are comparable to previous studies; In S. frugiperda cytochrome P450 CYP6B50 and cytochrome P450 CYP306A1 were up-regulated at low and high temperatures, respectively ( Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). In a comparison of transcriptional responses to low and high temperatures, several CYP P450 genes were up-regulated under both low and high temperatures in three rice plant hopper species ( Huang et al., 2017 ). Similarly, there was an up-regulation of CYP P450s in Glyphodes pyloalis after exposure to 40 °C for 4 h ( Liu et al., 2017 ). This implied that CYPs have a significant role in both cold and heat stress responses in insects and therefore their up-regulation may be essential for tolerating thermal stress through regulation of intracellular oxidative stress and cellular toxic substance metabolism. Under temperature stress (both cold and heat) the DEGs of T. leucotreta were substantively concentrated in the metabolic process (i.e. organic substance metabolic activity, primary metabolic activity, nitrogen metabolic activity) and membrane (i.e. extracellular activity). Equally, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that more DEGs were involved in thiamine metabolism, purine metabolism, folate metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism pathways. This may indicate that T. leucotreta principally responds to temperature stress through the expression of energy metabolism and metabolic products.",
          "Generally, we have observed that differences in gene expression in this study are directly related to the temperature. Insects function optimally when within critical thermal limits and therefore exposure to temperatures outside these critical thermal limits may result in a loss of function, which if sustained, results in death. The optimal temperature range, however, varies across and among species, based on their thermal history (the range of temperatures to which a species was exposed during a specific period) ( Verhoef et al., 2014 ). Similarly, individuals' capacity for thermal tolerance varies within and between insect populations, and it is significantly influenced by several biological and environmental factors i.e. life stage, age, wing morph, sex, body size, body colour, individual conditions, photoperiod, oxygen availability, the presence of symbiont, and temperature conditions experienced by the parents ( González-Tokman et al., 2020 )."

          "In insects, extreme temperature treatments can result in the expression of stress-related gene families. The current study utilized RNA-Seq sequence reads to generate a comprehensive transcriptome of T. leucotreta in response to thermal stress and compared the existence of transcriptional changes (up- and down-regulation) of several genes in response to thermal stress. This study has elucidated that some essential genes, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), cytochrome P450, and cuticle proteins, may be involved in the physiological processes of T. leucotreta 's low or high-temperature tolerance. We have also established that acute thermal stress has a significant impact on metabolic pathways in T. leucotreta . Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of thermal tolerance in T. leucotreta , as well as biochemical markers that could be useful in designing effective thermal quarantine phytosanitary treatments. Thus, future studies should focus on the functional validation of specific genes suspected to be used by T. leucotreta to cope with extreme thermal stresses."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction False codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is an important phytosanitary and quarantine pest of a wide range of fruits and vegetables, native to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) ( Stibick et al., 2010 ). The larva feeds on >100 host plant species including agriculturally vital crops like cotton, avocados, guavas, peaches, citrus, grapes, Rosa spp., and Solanaceous plants such as Capsicum ( EPPO, 2019 ; Mutyambai et al., 2020 ). The pest restricts the production and trade of most fresh commodities due to the polyphagous nature of its larvae. Therefore, for effective management of T. leucotreta , it is recommended to implement both preharvest and postharvest control strategies. Consequently, in Africa, the vast majority of farmers employ chemical pesticides pre-harvest, to manage this invasive insect ( Mutyambai et al., 2020 ; Adom et al., 2021 ). However, continuous unregulated pesticide use is not only untenable and uneconomical, but it also leads to export produce interceptions due to the presence of higher levels of pesticide residues in the fresh produce that exceed the internationally permitted maximum residue levels ( Fernandes et al., 2019 ). Hence, to reduce vulnerability to invasion and establishment by T. leucotreta in new regions, phytosanitary regulations in several international markets recommend using safe postharvest treatments to control T. leucotreta in various fresh commodities before acceptance ( EPPO, 2021 ; Li et al., 2022 ). Physical control methods, such as cold and heat treatments, are commonly used among the various postharvest treatment options available because they are more environmentally friendly than hazardous chemical treatments that pose safety and health risks ( IPPC, 2018 ; Pongener et al., 2018 ; Mwando et al., 2022 ). The ability of T. leucotreta larvae to survive and execute activity under diverse thermal conditions varies greatly with exposure temperature. Previous studies indicate that T. leucotreta larvae can survive temperatures as low as below −10 °C and as high as 52 °C, for at least an hour, depending on the stage of the larval instar ( Boardman et al., 2012 ; Terblanche et al., 2017 ). Thus, several studies have explored T. leucotreta 's thermal survival/mortality to design cold/heat phytosanitary treatment protocols ( Moore et al., 2017 ; Mwando et al., 2022 ). The treatments (cold/heat) ensure efficacious results in eliminating T. leucotreta in fresh produce before export, if well-developed and optimally administered. In contrast, if the treatment schedule is not strictly followed, some T. leucotreta may develop tolerance and survive the cold/heat treatment ( Moore and Hattingh, 2016 ; Moore and Manrakhan, 2022 ). Thermal tolerance in insects is critical for survival, development, reproduction, and their response to physical postharvest treatments ( Jensen et al., 2007 ; Terblanche et al., 2017 ). Temperature treatments may initiate both biochemical and physiological changes in the insect as it attempts to adapt to the new environment ( Rivers, 2008 ; González-Tokman et al., 2020 ). The T. leucotreta , like any other insect, employs a variety of mechanisms, including change in metabolism, promotion of stress responses such as the synthesis and use of heat shock proteins and activation of other molecular adaptations, to cope with either high or low-temperature stress ( Stotter and Terblanche, 2009 ; Terblanche et al., 2017 ). Similarly, T. leucotreta larvae have been shown to have high variability within and among thermal tolerance estimates, allowing them to survive a wider range of temperatures ( Terblanche et al., 2017 ). However, the molecular mechanism by which T. leucotreta uses thermotolerance to withstand these treatments is largely unknown. Understanding T. leucotreta 's molecular responses as a thermotolerance strategy to either acute high or low temperatures may aid in deciphering survival and mortality factors at the laboratory and field levels. To fully comprehend the physiological adaptation processes in insects, an extensive comparative study of gene expression regulation under heat stress is necessary. Next Generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), for example, can reveal in-depth details about an organism's transcriptional landscape ( Wang et al., 2009 ; Lowe et al., 2017 ). This method can be used to catalogue and quantify the entire set of transcripts for a particular tissue, developmental stage, or physiological condition in response to a specific stress ( Costa-Silva et al., 2017 ). In this regard, specific gene expression changes in response to temperature stress in a range of insect species have previously been investigated using RNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly ( Lü and Huo, 2018 ; Xiong et al., 2019 ; Vatanparast et al., 2021 ; Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). Consequently, RNA-seq enables researchers to study genes involved in signaling, putative functions that are activated, and pathways in insects under low- and high-temperature stress. De novo transcriptome assembly has also made it possible to examine how distinct differential gene expression occurs in response to a particular treatment in non-model insects (without reference genomes) ( Eldem et al., 2017 ) . To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive research has examined the transcriptomes of T. leucotreta in response to extreme temperature treatments. Therefore, in this study, we used transcriptomics to identify differences in gene expression patterns in thermally treated T. leucotreta. The study's specific goals were to (1) sequence and assemble a transcriptome reference from RNA-Seq data from T. leucotreta exposed to various temperature treatments, (2) estimate expression levels for each transcript in each sample, and (3) identify transcripts that are differentially expressed between samples, and the pathways involved. This study builds the foundation for the adaptive process and provides a wealth of information for finding and identifying novel genes involved in T. leucotreta 's responses to heat and cold stress. The understanding of T. leucotreta physiology at low and high temperatures could be used to improve the designing and development of effective physical postharvest phytosanitary treatment protocols. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Insect rearing, temperature treatments, and sample preparation False codling moths used in this study were reared at the Animal Rearing and Quarantine Unit (ARQU) of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology ( icipe ), Nairobi, Kenya. The T. leucotreta source colony was initially established in 2015 from field-collected adults and larvae from a citrus orange fruit orchards in Wote, Makueni county, Kenya (01°47′11.38″ S; 037°57′51.99″ E, 1236 m above sea level). Every three months, wild individuals were infused into the colony, which had been sustained for >50 generations. The colony was reared in cylindrical glass jars (12 x 6 cm), corked with ventilated lids, at 26 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 10 % RH, and a 12:12 (L:D) h cycle, on an artificial diet as described by Moore et al. (2014) . To perform transcriptome analysis, third instar larvae were incubated at two cold temperature treatments i.e., −10 °C and 0 °C, and two heat treatments i.e. 40 °C and 50 °C in a temperature chamber (MIR-554 Cooled Incubator, PHC Europe B.V., Nijverheidsweg, The Netherlands) with a variance of 0.5 °C. A temperature recorder (Brannan-13/420/3 Digital thermo-hygrometer, Cumbria, England) was used to check the output temperature of the incubator. For each treatment, 30 third-instar larvae were collected in sterile Petri dishes (100 mm diameter) and placed under respective treatment temperatures for 1 h and allowed to recover at ambient room temperature (25 °C) for 1 h. The larvae then were gently stimulated using a paintbrush to determine if they were still alive. They were considered dead if they did not respond to prodding, with a controlled muscular response. The control treatment larvae were held at room temperature for the same period. Each treatment was replicated three times. After the temperature treatment, the live larvae were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. 2.2 RNA extraction and NGS Illumina sequencing Total RNA was extracted from whole bodies of T. leucotreta larvae using the Isolate II RNA Mini Kit (Meridian Bioscience, London, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant DNA-free total RNA was eluted in 60 μL nuclease-free water then its purity, concentration, and integrity were assessed using Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Wilmington, USA) before subsequent analyses. To obtain short-read sequences, RNA purification, library construction, and Illumina sequencing were performed at Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). Then using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA), each library was constructed from 1 μg total RNA extracted from the whole body of three individuals (pooled) of T. leucotreta larvae per treatment and then sequenced using the HiSeq 4000 System (Illumina, San Diego, USA) with a 101 bp paired-end read. The subsequent data analyses were performed in Galaxy ( https://galaxyproject.org/community/ ) ( The Galaxy Community, 2022 ) and OmicsBox version 2.2.4 ( https://www.biobam.com/omicsbox/ ) bioinformatics softwares, following the steps shown in Supplementary Fig. S.1. 2.3 De novo transcriptome assembly and quality assessment Before de novo transcriptome assembly, Trimmomatic (version 0.38) was used to filter the Illumina short reads to remove sequencing adapters, ambiguous nucleotides, and low-quality reads ( Bolger et al., 2014 ). Raw reads having a Phred score of base quality <20 and/or a length <50 bp were discarded. FastQC (version 0.11.9) was used to inspect the data quality before and after trimming ( Andrews, 2022 ). Quality-filtered reads were pooled from all replicates of each treatment to generate an Illumina-based de novo transcriptome assembly using Trinity (version 2.9.1) ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ). The total number of genes, transcripts, GC content, maximum/minimum/median/average contig length, and total assembled bases were calculated using the Fasta statistics tool ( Kyran, 2021 ). Using CD-HIT-EST (version 4.8.1), the longest assembled contigs were filtered and clustered into non-redundant transcripts ( Li and Godzik, 2006 ; Fu et al., 2012 ). The output transcripts (unigenes) were subsequently used for analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and annotating against several known sequence databases. The longest open reading frame (ORF) prediction for unigenes was performed using TransDecoder (version 5.5.0) ( Haas et al., 2013 ) to identify candidate coding regions within transcript sequences. After extracting ORFs of at least 100 amino acids in length, the TransDecoder estimated the likely coding areas. The completeness and quality of the de novo assembly were assessed with BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) (version 5.3.2), using three curated OrthoDB sets: Arthropoda, Insecta, and Lepidoptera ( Simão et al., 2015 ; Seppey et al., 2019 ). The BUSCO results were then plotted. The processed reads were mapped back to the raw transcriptome assembly after BUSCO evaluation to calculate the percentage of correctly mapped reads. 2.4 Differential gene expression analysis Low-expression transcripts were removed before differential gene analysis using the filter low-expression transcript tool (with a stringency of at least 1 TPM), to lessen the severity of the correction and increase the power of detection ( Risso et al., 2011 ). Using Bowtie2 (version 2.4.5), trimmed reads from each sample were aligned to the assembled reference, and the abundances of the unigenes across samples were estimated into the read count as an expression measure by the RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization) (version 1.3.2) algorithm using align read and estimate abundance tool ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ). Each transcript's normalized expression was estimated as fragments per kilobase transcript length per million fragments mapped (FPKM). Pairwise differential gene expression analysis among the treatments was performed using the Deseq2 method ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ), and all statistical tests were adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg's false discovery rate (FDR). To identify significant DEGs between treatments, extract, and cluster differentially expressed transcripts tool with viz. parameters; p -value cutoff for FDR of <0.05 and log 2 FC ≥ 2 or ≤ −2 was executed. Simple bar plots, Venn diagrams, and volcano plots were used to visualize the distribution of expression levels between the groups ( Heberle et al., 2015 ; Goedhart and Luijsterburg, 2020 ). Lastly, the GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.0) ( www.graphpad.com ) was used to create the heat maps. 2.5 Functional annotation of DEGs and pathway classification analysis The DEGs sequences were aligned against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein sequence database using the BLASTX-fast tool with an E -value cutoff of 10 −6 in the OmicsBox program and only the best homologue was reported. InterProScan was then performed on the sequences. GO mapping and annotation were performed against the Gene Ontology database in OmicsBox (version 2.2.4). InterProScan and GO annotation were combined and GO terms were then assigned to the annotated sequences to predict the functions of the unique sequences. Lastly, KEGG analysis was performed to identify and classify the most involved/affected pathways. 2.6 Validation of DEGs' profiles by RT-qPCR To validate RNA-Seq results, RT-qPCR was deployed. First, cDNA was generated using Tetro™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Meridian Life Science Inc., USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used as a template in the validation assays. Fifteen significantly co-expressed genes in response to cold treatment (T-10) and heat (T50), were selected. All gene-specific markers (Supplementary Table S.4) were designed using Primer-BLAST ( Ye et al., 2012 ), optimized, then used in RT-qPCR assays. The reaction mix consisted of, 1.5 uL PCR water, 2.5 μL cDNA template, 0.5uL p moles of specific primers, and 5.0 μL of SensiFAST™ SYBR® Hi-ROX Kit (Meridian Life Science Inc., USA). All reactions were done in triplicates, with three biological replicates and three technical replicates, and set up in QuantStudio 5 real-time qPCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Horsham, and Loughborough, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The melting curve analysis was used to evaluate the qPCR products and then the comparative CT (2 −ΔΔCT ) method was applied in the quantitative analysis of the results ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ), with actin (ACT) as a reference gene ( Wang et al., 2020 ). Finally, for each selected gene, the ratio of FPKM and mRNA expression levels were compared. 3 Results 3.1 Survival of T. leucotreta larvae after thermal treatment Following temperature treatments of −10 °C (T-10), 0 °C (T0), 40 °C (T40), and 50 °C (T50) for 1 h, 87 %, 98.89 %, 98.89 % and 30 % of the larvae, respectively, were recovered after 1 h at ambient conditions (25 °C) ( Fig. 1 ). 3.2 Sequencing, RNA-Seq assembly, and assembly completeness After transcriptome sequencing, a total of 32.92 Gb with Q30 > 94 % Illumina raw data was generated (Supplementary Table S.1). The data were subjected to quality filtering, and 27.44 Gb of clean data passed the Illumina quality filter with Q30 > 95 % (Supplementary Table S.2). The contigs assembled into 226,067 transcripts with a mean length of 776 bp and an N50 of 1253 bp, and 127,018 unigenes with a mean length of 665 bp and an N50 of 999 bp after CD-HIT-EST clustering (Supplementary Table S.3). The BUSCO test revealed a total of 92.2 % (S: 80.0 %, D: 12.2 %) of the 1013 orthologues searched in the Arthropoda ortholog sequence set being fully recovered with another 4.1 % represented as partial sequences ( Fig. 2 ). A total of 90.9 % (S:77.8 %, D:13.1 %) of the 1367 orthologues searched in the Insecta lineage were entirely recovered with another 4.8 % represented as partial sequences ( Fig. 2 ), and among the 5286 orthologues searched in the Lepidoptera lineage, 83.4 % (S:69.5 %, D:13.9 %) were recovered completely with another 4.2 % represented as partial sequences ( Fig. 2 ). Similarly, after the assembly, the reads were remapped on the raw transcriptome and all the reads had >80 % alignment rate. 3.3 Differential gene expression under low and high thermal stress Differentially expressed genes were identified in comparison to the control (T25) under low (T-10 and T0) and high (T40 and T50) temperature treatments. T-10 (1223) caused the most unigene expression changes, which were then followed by T50 (1047), T0 (372), and T40 (342), in that order. There were 874, 91, 159, and 754 differentially expressed unigenes explicitly for T-10, T0, T40, and T50, respectively ( p -value <0.05 and log 2 FC ≥ 2 or ≤ −2) ( Fig. 3 ). Cold treatments (T-10 and T0) shared 194 DEGs while heat treatments (T40 and T50) shared 90 DEGs ( Fig. 3 ). Similarly extreme thermal treatments (T-10 and T50) shared 173 DEGs. There were only 15 DEGs that were found shared among the four thermal treatments. Simple bar graphs and volcano plots depicting all up- and down-regulated contigs for each treatment in comparison to T25 as the control were plotted to examine the most likely specific genes associated with these temperature treatments ( Figs. 4 and 5 ). To compare and show the expression levels of shared unigenes between groups, heat maps with a criterion of p -value < 0.01 and log 2 FC ≥ 2 or ≤ −2 were plotted ( Fig. 6 ). Spod-11-tox b protein ( p-value 3.21 E -12), fatty acyl-CoA reductase wat-like ( p-value 2.52E-10), protein lethal(2)essential for life-like, heat shock protein 68-like ( p-value 2.25E-06) and cuticle protein 19.8-like ( p-value 3.15E-05) showed high expression levels when T. leucotreta was subjected to −10 °C, in comparison with 50 °C and 25 °C ( Fig. 6 A and Supplementary Table S.5). On the other hand, circadian clock-controlled protein-like ( p-value 3.74E-11), cytochrome P450 6B5-like ( p-value 4.49E-05) and glycine-rich cell wall structural protein 1-like ( p-value 0.000147) showed high expression levels when T. leucotreta was subjected to 50 °C heat treatment, in comparison with −10 °C and 25 °C ( Fig. 6 A and Supplementary Table S.6). There were only six DEGs shared among the groups ( Fig. 6 B). Most of the unigenes, however, did not have blast hits, therefore, no description was available. 3.4 Functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes BLASTX- fast was used to validate and annotate the DEGs against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database, with an E -value cutoff of 10 −6 . Overall, the bulk of unigenes could not be annotated or had insufficient definitions (e.g., putative, unknown, hypothetical, unnamed protein, or uncharacterized). Nevertheless, BLASTX matches in the NR database revealed that the DEGs unigenes sequences were most similar to gene sequences from Leguminivora glycinivorella (67.47 %) and had a total of >96.94 % similarity with the lepidopteran genus including Choristoneura fumiferana (Tortricidae) , Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae) , Plutella xylostella (Plutellidae) , Chilo suppressalis (Crambidae) , Grapholita molesta (Tortricidae) , Euphydryas editha (Nymphalidae) , Ostrinia furnacalis (Crambidae) , Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) , Chrysodeixis includes (Noctuidae) , Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae) , Helicoverpa zea (Noctuidae) , Danaus plexippus plexippus (Nymphalidae) , Helicoverpa armigera (Noctuidae) and Spodoptera sp. (Noctuidae) ( Fig. 7 ). To make the functional classification of the screened unigenes clearer, GO annotations were carried out. The functions of DEGs were substantially different with incubation of T. leucotreta larvae at −10 and 50 °C in comparison to 25 °C ( Fig. 8 ). At low temperature (T-10), the T. leucotreta 's most important GO terms were; Biological process: metabolic process, cellular process, localization and response to stimulus, Molecular function: catalytic activity, binding, structural molecule activity and transporter activity and Cellular component: cellular anatomical entity and protein-containing complex ( Fig. 8 A). On the other hand, a comparison of GO data between the T50 and T25 groups found the following significant increase in the number of unigenes: Biological process: cellular activity, metabolic process, response to stimuli and localization, Molecular function: catalytic activity, binding, molecular function regulator activity, and transporter activity and Cellular component: cellular anatomical entity and protein-containing complex ( Fig. 8 B). 3.5 Pathways affected by low and high-temperature treatments in T. leucotreta The DEGs were used for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway classification analysis to identify the pathways that the DEGs were predicted to be involved in. The result indicated that when exposed to high- and low-temperature stress, the DEGs of T. leucotreta primarily accumulate in pathways associated with energy metabolism ( Fig. 9 ) with T-10 and T50 DEGs being assigned to 53 and 80 KEGG pathways, respectively ( Fig. 9 A and B). 3.6 Validation of differentially expressed genes' profiles by RT-qPCR Here, RT-qPCR was used to verify DEGs in RNA-seq data to validate the precision and reproducibility of the Illumina RNA-seq. Validation of nine DEGs from T50 in comparison to T25 was performed. This comprised of six up-regulated DEGs (heat shock protein 68-like, heat shock protein 70 family, cytochrome p 450 6B4, lipase 1-like, STAGA complex 65 subunit gamma-like, and neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit beta-3-like) and three down-regulated DEGs (macrophage mannose receptor 1-like, spod-11-tox b protein, and fatty acyl-CoA reductase wat-like). Similarly, in T-10, validation of seven DEGs, comprising four up-regulated DEGs (heat shock protein Hsp-12.2-like, larval cuticle protein A2B-like, myofilin isoform B, and cytochrome P450 4C1-like) and three DEGs that showed down-regulation (odorant binding protein, endocuticle structural glycoprotein SgAbd-5-like, and lipase 1-like) was performed. The results demonstrate that qPCR and Illumina FPKM changes in expression were in the same direction in both groups i.e. T50 ( Fig. 10 A and Supplementary Table S.6) and T-10 ( Fig. 10 B and Supplementary Table S.5). The Illumina sequencing results were congruent with the qPCR data with slight variations, confirming the transcriptome analysis's dependability and accuracy of RNA-Seq use in the study of genes involved in thermal tolerance in T. leucotreta . 4 Discussion To better understand the molecular responses of an invasive insect pest to thermal stress, a detailed transcriptome analysis of the pest's gene expression regulation is crucial. The current study successfully sequenced, assembled a transcriptome reference from RNA-Seq data from the T. leucotreta thermal (cold and heat) treated samples, estimated expression levels for each transcript in each sample, identified transcripts that were differentially expressed between the samples, and performed pathway enrichment analysis. The major challenge of RNA-Seq technology in non-model organisms is always assembling a high-quality reference transcript set from short reads ( Eldem et al., 2017 ). It is imperative therefore to assess the completeness of de novo assembly before proceeding with downstream analyses. In this study, after filtering and clustering the assembled transcripts into non-redundant transcripts (unigenes), the length distribution of unigenes closely followed the length distribution of transcripts. Similarly, the transcriptome had high BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) completeness scores with at least 83 % of BUSCO genes in the three curated OrthoDB sets: Arthropoda (92.2 %), Insecta (90.9 %), and Lepidoptera (83.4 %) matching it, with very few missing or fragmented. Also, the transcriptome had more than an 80 % alignment rate. A transcriptome is considered to be of excellent quality if it contains >80 % of BUSCO genes and has a substantial majority (>80 %) of the reads (those used in its construction) mapping/aligning to the assembly ( Simão et al., 2015 ; Seppey et al., 2019 ). This implies that our transcript set was of high quality and thus suitable and reliable for use in subsequent downstream analyses. The T. leucotreta larvae like any other insect species, use a variety of molecular response strategies to aid in thermotolerance ( Ran et al., 2020 ), including transcriptional co-regulation (both up and down-regulation) of key genes that participate in the physiological process of low or high-temperature tolerance. The gene expression of T. leucotreta differed significantly between the control (25 °C) and thermally treated samples in this study. This implies that several genes were co-regulated in response to these cold and heat treatments. Our results show that the greater the difference between the thermal treatment temperature and the control temperature (25 °C), the greater the number of expressed unigenes, with extreme temperatures of −10 and 50 °C having the largest number of expression changes in unigenes (1223 and 1047, respectively) when compared to other temperature treatments of 0 and 40 °C (372 and 342, respectively) that were close to the control (25 °C). Similarly, more genes were significantly up-regulated at −10 °C (893) and 50 °C (552) treatments than at 0 °C (149) and 40 °C treatments (127) ( Fig. 4 ). This suggests that the expression of genes in T. leucotreta increases as the temperature shifts from the optimally ambient point. However, this is only possible up to a certain point, the critical thermal limits. Several other studies have found transcriptional changes in genes, particularly those involved in thermotolerance when the insect is subjected to thermal stress ( Xiong et al., 2019 ; Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). However, the number of DEGs and their levels of co-regulation (up or down) vary between insects. This is possibly due to differences in temperature, exposure time, and/or insect species. We validated and annotated the DEGs using gene ontology (GO), however, the vast majority of unigenes could not be linked to recognized genes, most likely due to the comparatively short length of the discrete gene sequences and the lack of T. leucotreta genome information. Nonetheless, when we compared transcriptome profiles for the annotated DEGs, we discovered several DEGs, including heat shock proteins, cytochrome P450, cuticle proteins, odorant binding proteins, and immune system genes that had previously been associated with cold and high-temperature stresses ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Xiong et al., 2019 ; Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones that promote proper folding and prevent irreversible denaturation of other essential proteins in the presence of thermal or other forms of stress ( Colinet et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ). In this study, low-temperature treatments resulted in the up-regulation of Hsp68 and Hsp12.2 while in heat treatment, Hsp68 and Hsp70 were up-regulated. Similarly, protein lethal (2) essential for life (l(2)efl) which encodes for the Hsp20 family was also up-regulated under high-temperature treatments . These findings are comparable to those of prior research that demonstrated that insects express HSPs in response to thermal stress, which links them to thermotolerance ( Štětina et al., 2015 ). For instance, to increase its thermotolerance, Frankliniella occidentalis , expressed Hsp70 more when under heat stress ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). Moreover, Stegobium paniceum significantly increased Hsp60 under high and low temperatures to help it withstand temperature stress ( Zhu et al., 2017 ). In desert beetles, Microdera punctipennis , three Hsp90 and four Hsp70 were up-regulated by cold stress. Similarly, there was an increase in Hsp70 and Hsp83 when red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta was exposed at 10 °C and 40 °C, respectively. Furthermore, HSPs have been linked to heat tolerance in Drosophila buzzatii lines selected for heat resistance ( Sørensen et al., 2003 ). Our study, like the previous studies, indicates that T. leucotreta co-regulates HSPs that play a critical role in thermotolerance by aiding in proper folding and preventing irreversible denaturation of other essential proteins. The differences in the expression of HSPs in organisms including insects however, could be due to factors such as insect species, sex of an organism, and intensity of temperature ( Zhou et al., 2019 ; Farahani et al., 2020 ). Similarly, insects may down-regulate the expression of some HSPs as a strategy to reduce the energy requirements for heat shock response caused by continuous thermal stress ( Wang et al., 2008 ; Li et al., 2012 ). In the current study, the chemosensory protein, CSP14, and odorant binding protein were down-regulated both in extremely low (−10 °C) and high (50 °C) temperatures. By binding and delivering odorant molecules to chemosensory/olfactory receptors (ORs) on olfactory neurons, these proteins play a role in insect chemosensory perception in the peripheral nerve system ( Younas et al., 2018 ; Waris et al., 2022 ). The down-regulation of these proteins suggests that the appropriate reaction of T. leucotreta to chemical cues in the environment is impaired under extreme temperatures. Previous studies indicate that temperature extremes and stress conditions such as starvation elicit changes in certain chemosensory proteins ( Jafari and Alenius, 2015 ; Vatanparast et al., 2021 ). Vatanparast and Park (2022) demonstrated that two odorant binding proteins ( OBP17 and OBP25 ) in Spodoptera frugiperda were down-regulated at high temperatures. However, there was an up-regulation in OBP25 when S. frugiperda was subjected to low temperature (4 °C). Similarly, under high temperature-acclimation conditions, four OBPs were discovered to be up-regulated and five were found to be down-regulated in the third antennal segments of Drosophila sp. ( Jafari and Alenius, 2015 ). The differences in the response of odorant binding protein to low temperatures are probably due to differences in insect species, exposure time, and intensity of the low temperatures in the separate studies. Hence, this study's acute temperature treatments (−10 and 50 °C) may have been extreme for T. leucotreta chemosensory protein to appropriately function. Cuticle proteins in insects perform a vital physiological role in conferring the physical properties of the exoskeleton such as barring the evaporation of water and acting as a barrier to the environment ( Zhao et al., 2017 ). Here, the expression of the cuticular protein varied depending on the temperature treatment. Cuticle protein 19.8-like and larval cuticle protein A2B-like were up-regulated after cold stress (−10 °C) while in heat treatment (50 °C), these proteins were down-regulated. There was however an up-regulation of larval cuticle protein LCP-30-like in heat treatment. Varied changes in cuticular protein gene expression in response to thermal stress have also been observed in studies of other insect species such as stick insects ( Dunning et al., 2013 ), planthoppers ( Huang et al., 2017 ), and moths ( Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). The co-regulation of cuticular protein genes in response to thermal stress in insects, therefore, differs depending on the temperature magnitude and exposure time. We found an overall up-regulation response of cytochrome p 450s (CYPs) to thermal treatment. There was an up-regulation of cytochrome p 450 6B5-like, 4V2-like, 4d2-like, 6B2-like, 6B6-like, 6B7-like, and 4C1-like in response to cold treatment and CYP 6B5-like and 9e2-like in response to heat treatment. The overall up-regulation in a significant number of CYP p450 both at low and high temperatures is an indication that thermal stress increases oxidative stress in the insect body. These findings are comparable to previous studies; In S. frugiperda cytochrome P450 CYP6B50 and cytochrome P450 CYP306A1 were up-regulated at low and high temperatures, respectively ( Vatanparast and Park, 2022 ). In a comparison of transcriptional responses to low and high temperatures, several CYP P450 genes were up-regulated under both low and high temperatures in three rice plant hopper species ( Huang et al., 2017 ). Similarly, there was an up-regulation of CYP P450s in Glyphodes pyloalis after exposure to 40 °C for 4 h ( Liu et al., 2017 ). This implied that CYPs have a significant role in both cold and heat stress responses in insects and therefore their up-regulation may be essential for tolerating thermal stress through regulation of intracellular oxidative stress and cellular toxic substance metabolism. Under temperature stress (both cold and heat) the DEGs of T. leucotreta were substantively concentrated in the metabolic process (i.e. organic substance metabolic activity, primary metabolic activity, nitrogen metabolic activity) and membrane (i.e. extracellular activity). Equally, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that more DEGs were involved in thiamine metabolism, purine metabolism, folate metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism pathways. This may indicate that T. leucotreta principally responds to temperature stress through the expression of energy metabolism and metabolic products. Generally, we have observed that differences in gene expression in this study are directly related to the temperature. Insects function optimally when within critical thermal limits and therefore exposure to temperatures outside these critical thermal limits may result in a loss of function, which if sustained, results in death. The optimal temperature range, however, varies across and among species, based on their thermal history (the range of temperatures to which a species was exposed during a specific period) ( Verhoef et al., 2014 ). Similarly, individuals' capacity for thermal tolerance varies within and between insect populations, and it is significantly influenced by several biological and environmental factors i.e. life stage, age, wing morph, sex, body size, body colour, individual conditions, photoperiod, oxygen availability, the presence of symbiont, and temperature conditions experienced by the parents ( González-Tokman et al., 2020 ). 5 Conclusion In insects, extreme temperature treatments can result in the expression of stress-related gene families. The current study utilized RNA-Seq sequence reads to generate a comprehensive transcriptome of T. leucotreta in response to thermal stress and compared the existence of transcriptional changes (up- and down-regulation) of several genes in response to thermal stress. This study has elucidated that some essential genes, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), cytochrome P450, and cuticle proteins, may be involved in the physiological processes of T. leucotreta 's low or high-temperature tolerance. We have also established that acute thermal stress has a significant impact on metabolic pathways in T. leucotreta . Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of thermal tolerance in T. leucotreta , as well as biochemical markers that could be useful in designing effective thermal quarantine phytosanitary treatments. Thus, future studies should focus on the functional validation of specific genes suspected to be used by T. leucotreta to cope with extreme thermal stresses.
