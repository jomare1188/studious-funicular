    "full_text": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and auxins are critical in the development of root hairs, but the interaction mechanism by which they jointly regulating the development of citrus needs further clarification. This study investigated the influence of Funneliformis mosseae on the growth, root architecture, root hair traits, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content and flow rate, and auxins efflux carrier protein genes ( PtPINs ) expression in potted trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata L.) over 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of inoculation. Results indicated continuous increases in mycorrhizal colonization and soil hyphae length over time. Compared with the non-AMF, AMF significantly enhanced plant growth and biomass, and notably increased total root length, projected area, surface area, volume, and the number of 2 nd -order lateral roots, with these parameters improving further over the treatment duration. Whereas root hair growth was inhibited at 4 w, 6 w and 8 w, it was promoted at 10 w and 12 w following AMF treatment. AMF also significantly increased the content of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) over time. And the expression patterns of auxins flow rate and PtPINs vary across different treatment periods, showing a strong correlation with citrus growth and root hair development. Specifically, PtPINs were significantly correlated with total IAA flow rate and total root hair growth, with PtPIN6 potentially playing a positive role in root hair development. These findings suggested that auxins are involved in AMF-regulated citrus root hair growth, with PtPIN6 identified as a potentially key gene in auxin transport regulation."

          "Root architecture is closely related to its ability for water and nutrients absorption from soil ( Lynch, 1995 ). In this process, the role of root hair cannot be ignored, especially in obtaining nutrients with poor mobility (e.g. phosphorus) ( Kohli et al., 2022 ). Root hairs, which are highly specialized cells originating from the root epidermis, are generally located in the mature area of the root tip ( Grierson et al., 2014 ). Their presence increases the absorption surface of roots and facilitates the activation of insoluble nutrients in the soil by secreting a variety of substances including organic acids. Plants can absorb and utilize these substances ( Li et al., 2022 ; Tanaka et al., 2014 ). Besides, root hairs not only shape soil structure and provide a favorable microenvironment for soil microorganisms, but are also popular with beneficial microorganisms such as rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) by serving as a link for invading and establishing symbiotic relationships ( Kohli et al., 2022 ). However, root hairs characteristics such as length and curvature provide a greater nutrient uptake advantage than density ( Keyes et al., 2013 ).",
          "AMF are beneficial microorganisms in the soil that can invade the interior of the root and form a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with host plants ( Zhu et al., 2022 ). AMF improves the nutrient status of host plants primarily through its own large hyphae networks ( Selosse et al., 2006 ), as well as by improving the root architecture to increase host plant nutrient uptake capacity ( Wu et al., 2012 ). As a result, AMF colonization can effectively alleviate the growth inhibitory effect of the plants with few or no root hairs ( Jakobsen et al., 2005 ), even though the ability of AMF hyphae to acquire nutrients is not always superior to that of root hairs ( Brown et al., 2013 ). In addition, previous study found that the AMF colonization rate tends to be negatively correlated with the root hair density and length ( Ma et al., 2021 ). Meanwhile, AMF colonization may interestingly inhibit the root hair elongation and density increase in the well-developed root hair plants ( Shao et al., 2018 ). Whereas, a study on the trifoliate orange with underdeveloped root hairs discovered that the root hair density and length increased significantly when AMF colonized the roots ( Wu et al., 2016 ), suggesting that AMF and root hairs may have a competitive or cooperative relationship. Moreover, this relationship may be related to the root traits of the plant itself, which require additional research.",
          "Auxins serve as a key regulator on root development ( Roychoudhry et al., 2022 ), and plays a vital role within the development of root hairs ( Lee et al., 2013 ). It has been found that the regulatory influence of auxin on the root hair development is closely tied to its concentration gradient within the root system, i.e., the increase in intracellular auxin levels promotes root hair development, but its decrease reaps the opposite result ( Blilou et al., 2005 ; Retzer et al., 2021 ). Notably, the levels and distribution of auxin are dependent on the regulation of auxin influx and efflux rates by auxins polar transporter carriers ( Tanaka et al., 2006 ), which have been classified into two groups based on their functional characteristics: auxins efflux carrier, encoded by the PIN-FORMED ( PIN ) and P-GLYCOPROTEIN ( PGP ) gene families ( Adamowski et al., 2015 ; Cho et al., 2007 ), and auxins influx vector, encoded by the AUXIN1 / LIKE-AUX1 ( AUX / LAX ) gene family ( Péret et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, the PIN-LIKES (PILS) family, which has a remarkably similar topological structure to PIN proteins, has been found to promote auxins transport within cells ( Barbez et al., 2012 ). Studies have shown that the root hair length was determined by auxins levels. For example, the overexpression of auxins efflux transporter genes PIN1/2/3/4/7/8 and PGP4 can reduce the root hair length ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ; Cho et al., 2007 ), whereas the overexpression of the auxins influx transporter gene AUX1 , as well as the loss-of-function of pils2 pils5 double mutant and PGP4 single mutant, resulted in increasing the root hair length ( Cho et al., 2007 ; Barbez et al., 2012 ; Velasquez et al., 2016 ).",
          "Studies have indicated a correlation between the AMF and root architecture, as well as root hair growth, which is mediated by their regulation of auxins. Auxins, primarily present in plants as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) ( Woodward et al., 2005 ), has been shown to be significantly increased by AMF, leading to elevated root hair density and length. Previous study revealed that AMF significantly increased the IAA level, root hair density and length. This effect coincided with the down-regulation of PtPIN2 and PtPIN8 expressions and the up-regulation of PtLAX expression in the trifoliate orange seedlings ( Liu et al., 2018a , 2018b ). SlGH3.4 , a member of the tomato GH3 gene family that encodes IAA amide synthase, was found to increase arbuscular abundance and AMF colonization, as well as free IAA content in the SlGH3.4 loss-of-function mutant root, but decreased when SlGH3.4 of the tomato or rice was overexpressed ( Chen et al., 2022 ). These findings suggested a positive correlation between auxins content and mycorrhization levels. However, such a positive relationship was not emerged in the tea plants ( Sun et al., 2020 ) and exhibited a complex regulatory pattern in Trollius chinensis ( Jentschel et al., 2007 ). This variability may be attributed to various factors, such as fungal species, colonization time, host plant genotypes, nutrient levels, etc. ( Liu et al., 2018a ; Jentschel et al., 2007 ). Therefore, further investigation is warranted to elucidate the interaction patterns between AMF and auxins, as well as the key genes affecting citrus root development.",
          "Citrus ( Citrus L.) holds the distinction of being the foremost major fruit globally, boasting a cultivation area and yield that consistently rank among the highest worldwide. Trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata L.), a closely related citrus species, is widely used as an important rootstock in the citrus industry due to its strong resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, as well as its outstanding grafting affinity with most citrus cultivars ( Peng et al., 2020 ). Whereas, it has a shallow root distribution with sparse root hairs, which constrains their ability to absorb water and nutrients, thereby necessitating a significant dependence on AMF. Consequently, this study aims to explore the interaction between AMF and auxins in shaping the root architecture of trifoliate orange seedlings. This study inoculating Funneliformis mosseae ( F. mosseae ) at weeks 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, with an emphasis on assessing changes in root architecture, root hair development, as well as auxins content and distribution."

The seeds were then placed in an artificial climate chamber maintained at 28/20 °C (day/night) with a relative humidity of 80 % to accelerate germination. After 4 w, the three-leaf-old sterile seedlings (approximately 4 cm height) of uniform size were transplanted into a 1.5 L plastic pot containing 1.7 Kg of river sand (particle size ≤ 2 mm).

It was propagated using Trifolium repens as the host for 12 w. For the AMF treatment, 100 g of mycorrhizal inoculum, containing approximately 3000 spores along with a cultivation substance (soil: sand, v/ v = 3:1), soil hyphae, and root segments, were inoculated during seedlings transplanting. The non-AMF treatment involved the inoculation of 100 g of autoclaved (120 °C, 0.11Mpa, 2 h) mycorrhizal inoculum to minimize differences in microbial communities.",
              "To promote optimal AMF colonization, the field water capacity was maintained at 75 %, monitored by daily weighing during the treatment period. According to Liu et al. (2018a) , a nutrient solution with one-ten the normal phosphorus concentration was irrigated once a week (100 mL per application) to both support visible root hair development and sustain plant growth. This was supplemented with distilled water as needed to maintain optimal soil moisture content. The plants were harvested at intervals of 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 w following the initiation of the AMF treatment."

For each treatment, twenty-four 1-cm-long root segments of each region were cut and stored in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde for 24 h. Then, the root hair growth status was observed using the scanning electron microscope (JSM-6390LV, JEOL Co., Japan). The typical root hair photos were taken at 200 x and 400 x magnification, respectively, and the root hair density, length and diameter was determined by Image J software (National Institute of Health, MD, USA). Due to the almost absence of root hairs at the root cap, the root segments in this region (0–0.5 cm) were not cut to observe the root hair growth in this research. In addition, if the root length in other regions (0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm) is insufficient or too long, the root segments would be cut proportionally.",

Moreover, following AMF colonization, the relative expression of PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN3 , and PtPIN6 were reasonably up-regulated by 7.37-fold, 1.44-fold, 1.38-fold, and 2.65-fold, respectively, while the expression of PtPIN8 was down-regulated by 2.04-fold at 10 w under the AMF treatment ( Fig. 6 d). At 12 w, AMF colonization prominently up-regulated the expression of PtPIN1b and PtPIN3 by 1.23-fold and 1.47-fold, respectively, while down-regulated the expression of PtPIN1c, PtPIN2, PtPIN5, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 by 1.23-fold, 1.88-fold, 1.29-fold, 1.24-fold and 1.79-fold, respectively."

          "In the present study, the AMF-colonized trifoliate orange seedlings showed a proliferation of hyphal structures in the roots, both internally and externally ( Fig. 1 a–e). These structures increase nutrient availability, with the extensive network of extraradical hyphae acting as the primary conduit for better nutrient absorption in the host plant ( Selosse et al., 2006 ). The present study showed minimum mycorrhizal colonization of 36.44 % ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that AMF effectively colonized the trifoliate orange roots, as the threshold for AMF colonization to produce significant benefits to host plants is typically 20–30 % ( Feldmann et al., 2009 ). Arbuscular is a nutrient exchange apparatus that was formed by terminal repetition branches of intraradical hyphae and surrounded by an invaginated host plasma membrane ( Wang et al., 2017 ). Lipids are the main form of carbon source provided by host plants for AMF development, always stored in vesicles, which can stimulate the external hyphae growth and branching ( Kameoka et al., 2022 ). In this study, the trifoliate orange roots produced more pronounced arbuscular and vesicle structures as the AMF inoculation time increased ( Fig. 1 f, g), indicating a flourishing nutrient exchange AMF and host plants. Additionally, spores, serving as asexual propagule of AMF, can carry hundreds to thousands of haploid nucleuses per spore ( Kameoka et al., 2022 ), and their numbers also increased during the later stage of the AMF treatment ( Fig. 1 h). This finding emphasizes the importance of spore proliferation in the spread of AMF within trifoliate orange roots in our study.",
          "The present study showed that the colonization of AMF significantly promoted the plant growth performance and root architecture. Throughout the treatment periods, the total root length, projected area, surface area, volume and the number of 2 nd -order lateral roots in trifoliate orange seedlings increased significantly, with the promotion effect becoming more pronounced as treatment time was extended. These findings highlight the critical role of AMF in supporting host plant growth and development. Extraradical hyphae's slender and developed characteristics enable them to easily traverse between soil particles, by passing the nutrient depletion zone ( Zhu et al., 2022 ). They also facilitate nutrient redistribution between or within plants by connecting individual plant ( Selosse et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, AMF-induced improvements in root architecture improve nutrient uptake and utilization efficiency ( Wu et al., 2012 ), with auxins playing a critical role in these process ( Hu et al., 2021 ). In this experiment, the root IAA content of the trifoliate orange seedlings increased significantly and continuously increased as the AMF treatment was extended, which corresponded to the observed growth performance of the trifoliate orange seedlings. This suggested that IAA was involved in the AMF-induced growth promotion process.",
          "And the changes in root mycorrhizal infection rates of the trifoliate orange seedlings did not consistently align with the plant growth status and root morphology parameters. The relative growth rate of a few parameters decreased in the early stage of the AMF treatment, but most of the parameters still showed higher relative growth rate in the later stage of the AMF treatment. This discrepancy may be attributed to the carbon source obtained by AMF from the host ( Wang et al., 2017 ). In the early stage of colonization, AMF may require more carbon sources from the host plant to establish symbiotic structures, as the underdeveloped symbiotic structures do not provide excessive nutrients to the host plant. As symbiotic structures continue to develop, the mycorrhizal colonization rate also increases. However, higher mycorrhizal colonization rates may induce greater carbon costs, thereby reducing the benefits conferred by AMF colonization ( Garrido et al., 2010 ). But the carbon benefits of AMF colonization to host plants cannot be ignored. Previous study has indicated a positive correlation between the difference in carbon gains between the AMF and non-AMF treatments and mycorrhizal colonization rates ( Miller et al., 2002 ). Nonetheless, it remains controversial to solely judge the effectiveness of AMF based on mycorrhizal colonization rates, as numerous factors influence root AMF infection and its benefits to plants ( Treseder, 2013 ). Briefly, the relative growth rate of the trifoliate orange seedlings increased more prominently in the later stage of AMF treatment, indicating that the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on growth promotion cannot negligible.",
          "It is noteworthy to investigate the observed root dynamics in AMF-colonized plants, where previous studies have reported an increase in both the root diameter and lateral root numbers ( Bergmann et al., 2020 ; Chiu et al., 2022 ). However, in the present study, AMF inoculation had no effect on the average diameter, which remained <1 mm, but significantly increased the lateral root numbers of the trifoliate orange seedlings. As previously reported ( Bergmann et al., 2020 ), AMF may increase root diameter to expand colonization surface, whereas trifoliate orange may limit root thickening to reduce carbon costs, as the fine roots with diameters <2 mm show strong physiological activity, which is essential for nutrient and water uptake ( Iversen et al., 2017 ). In addition, the trifoliate orange belongs to the category of thicker absorbing roots, which have less root plasticity and a higher dependence on AMF than that who had fine root ( Li et al., 2017 ; Eissenstat et al. 2015 ).",
          "In addition, the root hairs are essential for water and nutrient uptake ( Kohli et al., 2022 ). In the present study, AMF dramatically inhibited the root hair growth at 4 w, 6 w and 8 w, but significantly improved it at 10 w and 12 w ( Table 4 ), consistent with the previous study on maize ( Kothari et al., 1990 ). Probably, the presence of symbiotic structures provided more nutrients for early-stage host plant growth during AMF infection ( Zhu et al., 2022 ), leading to a higher dependence on AMF and thus limiting the root hair growth. However, only the development of root hairs can provide for the survival of early trifoliate orange seedlings with underdeveloped lateral roots under non-AMF treatments. Additionally, the functional similarity between AMF and root hairs establishes a competitive relationship between them ( Johnson et al., 2015 ). For its own survival, AMF may seek more symbiotic opportunities to inhibit the root hair development ( Kothari et al., 1990 ). Howbeit, the improvement of the root architecture in trifoliate orange enhanced its nutrient uptake capacity with prolonged AMF infection time, while reducing the carbon cost of AMF colonization by promoting the root hair development because root hairs require a smaller amount of carbon source than AMF ( Johnson et al., 2015 ). In contrast, the trifoliate orange seedlings under Non - AMF treatment chose the latter between root hairs and well-developed lateral roots at a later stage. Research has demonstrated that auxins play a central role in the regulation of root hairs development ( Lee et al., 2013 ). However, it was puzzling that although the root IAA content significantly increased throughout the treatment periods, AMF only promoted root hair development in the later stage (10 w and 12 w). One speculation is that this discrepancy may be due to auxin's influence on ethylene, which indirectly affects the root hair development. Previous studies have revealed that elevated ethylene levels can increase the root hair length and density, particularly under high auxins concentration conditions ( Ma et al., 2001 ). In addition, this might be associated with intracellular auxins levels mediated by auxins transporter proteins ( Cho et al., 2007 ). Previous study also shown that increased auxins influx activity or decreased efflux activity promotes the root hair development, while the opposite inhibits it ( Cho et al., 2007 ). These findings suggest that within a certain range, higher intracellular auxins levels correlate with the superior root hair development, and vice versa ( Velasquez et al., 2016 ). These provided a well explanation for root hair growth and auxins changes during different growth stages in this study.",
          "Previous study has demonstrated that the overexpression of PIN1/2/3/4/7/8 inhibits root hair growth in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). In this study, despite significant downregulation of PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 , and dramatic upregulation of PtPIN2 and PtPIN5 after 4 w of AMF treatment, a decline was observed in both the IAA influx flow rate in the 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm root regions and most root hair growth indexes. Although upregulation of PIN2 generally promotes auxin flow from the stele to the elongation zone ( Yuan et al., 2020 ), and may increase IAA content in this zone, it still has not changed the poor development of root hairs in the elongation zone. This suggests that the increased PtPIN2 expression might decrease IAA content in hairy cells, thereby inhibiting root hair development ( Schlicht et al., 2008 ). Notably, PtPIN2 is the only PIN family member expressed in root epidermal cells, and exists within both the root and non-root hair cells ( Luschnig et al., 1998 ), indicating that its upregulation has a more pronounced inhibitory effect on root hair development compared to the downregulation of other family members. Most PtPINs were significantly up-regulated at 6 w and 8 w of AMF treatment, where, even though the increase of PIN3 proteins which are located in the plasma membrane of the lateral cells contributes to the lateral transport of auxin, which may increase the auxin content between root epidermal cells, its efflux effect on auxin in cells is unquestionable ( Friml et al., 2002 ). And the up-regulated PtPINs expressions were positively correlated with the reduced the total IAA influx rate but negatively correlated with the reduced the total root hair growth indexes. This suggests that the reduced intracellular IAA levels regulated by PtPINs up-regulation inhibited root hair development, consistent with the previous finding ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). Additionally, the increase of PIN5 and PIN8 proteins, predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum, likely contributed to the homeostasis of auxin in cells ( Křeček et al., 2009 ), which may explain the subtle changes in root hair development observed at 4 w, 6 w and 8 w post-AMF treatment. At 10 w of AMF treatment, the expression of PtPIN8 was significantly down-regulated, while the expression of PtPIN1/3/6 remained significantly up-regulated ( Fig. 6 ). Correlation analysis indicated that PtPIN8 had a positive correlation with the reduced total IAA efflux rate but a negative correlation with the increased total root hair growth indexes, which was consistent with the previous results on the trifoliate orange seedlings ( Liu et al., 2018a ). This indicates that higher intracellular auxin levels, regulated by PtPIN8 , likely enhanced root hair development. Moreover, the significantly down-regulated expression of PtPIN8 may have a stronger promoting effect on root hair development than the significantly up-regulated expression of PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c and PtPIN3 in inhibition effect, even though the inhibition efficiency can exceed 90 % when PIN1, PIN3 , and PIN8 are overexpressed ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). This may be because the significant down-regulation of PIN8 , while PIN5 was not significantly expressed, disrupted the intracellular auxin homeostasis ( Křeček et al., 2009 ), resulting in increased intracellular auxin levels, thus promoted root hair development. Similar results were found at 12 w of treatment. At 12 w of the AMF treatment, the expressions of PtPIN1c, PtPIN2, PtPIN5, PtPIN6 , and PtPIN8 were significantly down-regulated, while PtPIN1b and PtPIN3 were significantly up-regulated. The significant down-regulation of PtPINs was positively correlated with the increased total IAA influx rate and negatively correlated with the increased total root hair growth indexes, further demonstrating that the root hair development was regulated by intracellular auxins levels.",
          "It is puzzling that even though the down-regulation of PtPINs after 12 w of AMF treatment was stronger than that at 10 w, only the root hair density increased relatively significantly at 12 w, while the root hair diameter and length changed little or even decreased. This phenomenon may be related to the expression level of PIN family genes, although overexpression of some members might inhibit root hairs growth ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ), the reduced expression or loss of function may not necessarily promote root hair development. In trifoliate orange, the down-regulation of PIN2 dramatically promoted the root hair growth ( Liu et al., 2018a ), but in Arabidopsis thaliana, knocking out PIN2 resulted in shorter root hairs ( Rigas et al., 2013 ). This discrepancy may be attributed to PIN2 ’s role in mediating auxins transport from the meristem zone to the elongation zone and mature zone ( Yuan et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the polar transport of auxins from the elongation zone to the mature zone was inhibited when the expression of PIN2 is excessively reduced or absent, resulting in a decrease in auxins concentration in the root hair cells and poor root hair development. And PIN5 may have intracellular auxins transport activity in plant cells, due to being located in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Mravec et al., 2009 ). Some studies have shown that overexpression of PIN5 can faintly promote the root hair development ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). Therefore, the root hair development may be somewhat inhibited by decreased PIN5 expression, as per this conjecture.",
          "Furthermore, there has been little investigation into the effects of PIN6 on the root hair formation. The overexpression of PIN6 in the Arabidopsis thaliana does not alter the root hair formation, although it is found in hairy cells ( Cazzonelli et al., 2013 ). Moreover, the effect of pin6 deletion mutant on auxins response is contradictory ( Simon et al., 2016 ; Ditengou et al., 2018 ). This may be related to its special structure and dual localization in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and plasma membrane ( Simon et al., 2016 ). This study hypothesized that PtPIN6 might positively control root hair growth and development in the trifoliate orange seedlings. In detail, the total root hair growth indexes at 4 w and 10 w showed a decrease and an increase, respectively, which were both significantly and positively correlated with PtPIN6 , whose expression was significantly down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively. Moreover, the root hair length and diameter in certain root regions at 12 w were lower than those at 10 w, which was consistent with the trend of the relative expression of PtPIN6 . Nevertheless, the significant up-regulation of PtPIN6 at 6 w and 8 w was negatively correlated with the reduced root hair growth indexes (except for the root hair diameter after 6 w), probably, the inhibitory effect of up-regulation of PtPIN1, PtPIN3 , and PtPIN8 on root hairs was stronger than the promotional effect of up-regulation of PtPIN6 ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). As a result, more deeply research is needed to fully understand how PtPIN6 regulates the root hair production."

          "The AMF treatment was observed to significantly increase IAA content, promoted plant growth, and improve root architecture in trifoliate orange seedlings. The increased rate of trifoliate orange growth indexes was heavily influenced by PRLC increase within a defined range. Furthermore, AMF regulated the intracellular IAA level by modulating the expression of PtPINs , which in turn impacted the root hair development. PtPIN2 and PtPIN8 played crucial roles in root hair development and exhibited a negative correlation with it, whereas PtPIN6 appeared to positively influence root hair growth. The impact of AMF on root hair development was also dependent on the duration of colonization, with notable enhancements observed after 10 w. Given these findings, PtPIN6 emerged as a critical gene in the regulation of root hair growth, underscoring the need for additional research to further elucidate its role."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Root architecture is closely related to its ability for water and nutrients absorption from soil ( Lynch, 1995 ). In this process, the role of root hair cannot be ignored, especially in obtaining nutrients with poor mobility (e.g. phosphorus) ( Kohli et al., 2022 ). Root hairs, which are highly specialized cells originating from the root epidermis, are generally located in the mature area of the root tip ( Grierson et al., 2014 ). Their presence increases the absorption surface of roots and facilitates the activation of insoluble nutrients in the soil by secreting a variety of substances including organic acids. Plants can absorb and utilize these substances ( Li et al., 2022 ; Tanaka et al., 2014 ). Besides, root hairs not only shape soil structure and provide a favorable microenvironment for soil microorganisms, but are also popular with beneficial microorganisms such as rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) by serving as a link for invading and establishing symbiotic relationships ( Kohli et al., 2022 ). However, root hairs characteristics such as length and curvature provide a greater nutrient uptake advantage than density ( Keyes et al., 2013 ). AMF are beneficial microorganisms in the soil that can invade the interior of the root and form a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with host plants ( Zhu et al., 2022 ). AMF improves the nutrient status of host plants primarily through its own large hyphae networks ( Selosse et al., 2006 ), as well as by improving the root architecture to increase host plant nutrient uptake capacity ( Wu et al., 2012 ). As a result, AMF colonization can effectively alleviate the growth inhibitory effect of the plants with few or no root hairs ( Jakobsen et al., 2005 ), even though the ability of AMF hyphae to acquire nutrients is not always superior to that of root hairs ( Brown et al., 2013 ). In addition, previous study found that the AMF colonization rate tends to be negatively correlated with the root hair density and length ( Ma et al., 2021 ). Meanwhile, AMF colonization may interestingly inhibit the root hair elongation and density increase in the well-developed root hair plants ( Shao et al., 2018 ). Whereas, a study on the trifoliate orange with underdeveloped root hairs discovered that the root hair density and length increased significantly when AMF colonized the roots ( Wu et al., 2016 ), suggesting that AMF and root hairs may have a competitive or cooperative relationship. Moreover, this relationship may be related to the root traits of the plant itself, which require additional research. Auxins serve as a key regulator on root development ( Roychoudhry et al., 2022 ), and plays a vital role within the development of root hairs ( Lee et al., 2013 ). It has been found that the regulatory influence of auxin on the root hair development is closely tied to its concentration gradient within the root system, i.e., the increase in intracellular auxin levels promotes root hair development, but its decrease reaps the opposite result ( Blilou et al., 2005 ; Retzer et al., 2021 ). Notably, the levels and distribution of auxin are dependent on the regulation of auxin influx and efflux rates by auxins polar transporter carriers ( Tanaka et al., 2006 ), which have been classified into two groups based on their functional characteristics: auxins efflux carrier, encoded by the PIN-FORMED ( PIN ) and P-GLYCOPROTEIN ( PGP ) gene families ( Adamowski et al., 2015 ; Cho et al., 2007 ), and auxins influx vector, encoded by the AUXIN1 / LIKE-AUX1 ( AUX / LAX ) gene family ( Péret et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, the PIN-LIKES (PILS) family, which has a remarkably similar topological structure to PIN proteins, has been found to promote auxins transport within cells ( Barbez et al., 2012 ). Studies have shown that the root hair length was determined by auxins levels. For example, the overexpression of auxins efflux transporter genes PIN1/2/3/4/7/8 and PGP4 can reduce the root hair length ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ; Cho et al., 2007 ), whereas the overexpression of the auxins influx transporter gene AUX1 , as well as the loss-of-function of pils2 pils5 double mutant and PGP4 single mutant, resulted in increasing the root hair length ( Cho et al., 2007 ; Barbez et al., 2012 ; Velasquez et al., 2016 ). Studies have indicated a correlation between the AMF and root architecture, as well as root hair growth, which is mediated by their regulation of auxins. Auxins, primarily present in plants as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) ( Woodward et al., 2005 ), has been shown to be significantly increased by AMF, leading to elevated root hair density and length. Previous study revealed that AMF significantly increased the IAA level, root hair density and length. This effect coincided with the down-regulation of PtPIN2 and PtPIN8 expressions and the up-regulation of PtLAX expression in the trifoliate orange seedlings ( Liu et al., 2018a , 2018b ). SlGH3.4 , a member of the tomato GH3 gene family that encodes IAA amide synthase, was found to increase arbuscular abundance and AMF colonization, as well as free IAA content in the SlGH3.4 loss-of-function mutant root, but decreased when SlGH3.4 of the tomato or rice was overexpressed ( Chen et al., 2022 ). These findings suggested a positive correlation between auxins content and mycorrhization levels. However, such a positive relationship was not emerged in the tea plants ( Sun et al., 2020 ) and exhibited a complex regulatory pattern in Trollius chinensis ( Jentschel et al., 2007 ). This variability may be attributed to various factors, such as fungal species, colonization time, host plant genotypes, nutrient levels, etc. ( Liu et al., 2018a ; Jentschel et al., 2007 ). Therefore, further investigation is warranted to elucidate the interaction patterns between AMF and auxins, as well as the key genes affecting citrus root development. Citrus ( Citrus L.) holds the distinction of being the foremost major fruit globally, boasting a cultivation area and yield that consistently rank among the highest worldwide. Trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata L.), a closely related citrus species, is widely used as an important rootstock in the citrus industry due to its strong resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, as well as its outstanding grafting affinity with most citrus cultivars ( Peng et al., 2020 ). Whereas, it has a shallow root distribution with sparse root hairs, which constrains their ability to absorb water and nutrients, thereby necessitating a significant dependence on AMF. Consequently, this study aims to explore the interaction between AMF and auxins in shaping the root architecture of trifoliate orange seedlings. This study inoculating Funneliformis mosseae ( F. mosseae ) at weeks 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, with an emphasis on assessing changes in root architecture, root hair development, as well as auxins content and distribution. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Experimental set-up Newly harvested trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata L.) seeds were sterilized and sown in sterilized river sand (particle size ≤ 2 mm, autoclaved at 0.11 MPa and 121 °C for 2 h) ( Liu et al., 2022 ). The seeds were then placed in an artificial climate chamber maintained at 28/20 °C (day/night) with a relative humidity of 80 % to accelerate germination. After 4 w, the three-leaf-old sterile seedlings (approximately 4 cm height) of uniform size were transplanted into a 1.5 L plastic pot containing 1.7 Kg of river sand (particle size ≤ 2 mm). According to Liu et al. (2024) , the river sand was pre-autoclaved (121 °C, 0.11 MPa) for 2 h after pretreatment with a 10 % sulfuric acid-nitric acid solution. The fungal inoculum used in this study was Funneliformis mosseae (Nicol. & Gerd.) Schüßler & Walker [BGC XJ02], obtained from the Bank of Glomeromycota in China (BGC). It was propagated using Trifolium repens as the host for 12 w. For the AMF treatment, 100 g of mycorrhizal inoculum, containing approximately 3000 spores along with a cultivation substance (soil: sand, v/ v = 3:1), soil hyphae, and root segments, were inoculated during seedlings transplanting. The non-AMF treatment involved the inoculation of 100 g of autoclaved (120 °C, 0.11Mpa, 2 h) mycorrhizal inoculum to minimize differences in microbial communities. To promote optimal AMF colonization, the field water capacity was maintained at 75 %, monitored by daily weighing during the treatment period. According to Liu et al. (2018a) , a nutrient solution with one-ten the normal phosphorus concentration was irrigated once a week (100 mL per application) to both support visible root hair development and sustain plant growth. This was supplemented with distilled water as needed to maintain optimal soil moisture content. The plants were harvested at intervals of 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 w following the initiation of the AMF treatment. 2.2 Experimental design A completely randomized design was used with F. mosseae as the single factor, which was consistent with two treatments: inoculation (AMF) and non-inoculation (Non-AMF) of F. mosseae . Each treatment was repeated 30 times with a total of 60 pots. Then the pots after transplanting were placed in plastic greenhouses, and the positions of the two treatments were exchanged once a week to reduce environmental differences. 2.3 Determinations of variables At the trifoliate orange seedlings harvest, the plant height, stem diameter, leaf numbers were measured. The fresh weight of leaves, stems and roots were measured respectively. The Epson Perfection V700 Photo Dual Lens System (J221A, Indonesia) was used to scan the whole root system and the WinRHIZO Pro 2007b software (Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, QC, Canada) were used for analyzing the obtained pictures to obtain the total root length, projected area, surface area, diameter and volume. The taproot length and lateral root numbers were measured artificially. Two grams river sand sampled from the rhizosphere were collected to measure the soil hyphae length by the protocol described from Bethlenfalvay and Ames (1987) . Thirty 1–2 cm root segments were selected from each treatment and stained for 5 min with 0.05 % trypan blue ( Phillips, 1970 ), AM structures and infection rate were recorded under the Leica DME binocular light microscope (Leica Microsystem Inc., Wetzlar, Germany). The percentage of the root length colonized by mycorrhizal fungus (PRLC) was calculated by comparing the colonized root length to the total observed root length. Based on the lateral root length, we divided the root system into four regions including 0–0.5 cm, 0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm from the morphological apex of the root tip. For each treatment, twenty-four 1-cm-long root segments of each region were cut and stored in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde for 24 h. Then, the root hair growth status was observed using the scanning electron microscope (JSM-6390LV, JEOL Co., Japan). The typical root hair photos were taken at 200 x and 400 x magnification, respectively, and the root hair density, length and diameter was determined by Image J software (National Institute of Health, MD, USA). Due to the almost absence of root hairs at the root cap, the root segments in this region (0–0.5 cm) were not cut to observe the root hair growth in this research. In addition, if the root length in other regions (0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm) is insufficient or too long, the root segments would be cut proportionally. Root endogenous IAA was extracted from different regions of 0–0.5 cm, 0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm by following the method of Dobrev and Kaminek (2002) , and determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the mobile phase was a mixture with ddH 2 O and methanol (3/2, v:v), in which 10 μL extracted solutions was added and detected at the flow rate of 0.8 mL/min with the column temperature of 30 °C for 1 h. Referring to the method of Liu et al. (2018b) , the non-invasive micro-test technique (NMT, BIO-001A, Younger USA Sci. & Tech. Corp., Amherst, USA) was used to dynamically determine the IAA flux in different root regions (0–0.5 cm, 0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm, 4–6 cm from the root tip) of AMF and Non-AMF treatment seedlings, which was completed by the Xuyue (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. The data collection was obtained by the ASET software to achieve three-dimensional position of the electrode and the precision focusing control of the microscope, and the data was read every 6 s, each time three values were read consecutively for a total of 50 times. Root total RNA was extracted in 0.2 g fresh samples using the Takara kit (TaKaRa MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit), and the purity and concentration of RNA were detected by the ultra-micro spectrophotometer (K5600C, Beijing Kaio Technology Development Co., Ltd.). RNA with high purity was selected for reverse transcription using the Takara kit (PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser), and three tubes of high-quality cDNA were harvested from each RNA sample after removal gDNA, reverse transcription and CDNA quality detection. Screening of PtPINs family genes was referenced to previous transcriptome data (Accession No PRJNA558461) and the citrus database ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/ ). The primers for PtPIN genes and internal references were designed with the Primer 5.0 (Palo Alto, CA, USA) software ( Table 1 ), and synthesized by the Shanghai Sangon Bio. Tech. Co. (Wuhan China). qRT-PCR was carried out using a reaction mixture of 2 µL cDNA, 0.4 µL forward primer, 0.4 µL reverse primer, 10 µL AceQ qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix, and 7.2 µL ddH 2 O, totaling 20 µL. The reaction system was run on the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD, California, USA) with one cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s, and the run was finally ended with 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C held for 15 s. The experiment was repeated three times (biological replicates) by three technical replicates for each gene. The relative expression of the target genes was calculated by 2 −∆∆Ct method. 2.4 Statistical analysis One-way analysis of variance was performed on the data using the SAS (8.1) statistical software, and the significance level was p < 0.05. Sigma Plot 15.0 was used for drawing. Origin 2024SR1 software was used to analyze the data and plot the correlation heatmap with the significance level of p < 0.05 and the extremely significant level of p < 0.01. 3 Results 3.1 Mycorrhizal development The root mycorrhizal colonization status at different growth stages (4 w, 6 w, 8 w, 10 w, and 12 w after AMF inoculation) of the trifoliate orange seedlings are presented in Fig. 1 . The intraradical and extraradical hyphae were observed in the trifoliate orange roots ( Fig. 1 a–e). As the duration of infection increased, typical AMF structures such as vesicle ( Fig. 1 f), arbuscular ( Fig. 1 g) and spore ( Fig. 1 h) exhibited a significant increase. Furthermore, the mycelial and spore structures were also prominently observed in the rhizosphere sand ( Fig. 1 i-j). Data analysis revealed that the PRLC ranged from 36.44 % to 78.86 %, and the soil hyphae length in rhizosphere sand ranged from 20.86 to 58.49 cm/g after AMF inoculation for 4 w to 12 w ( Fig. 2 ), with the increasing trend varying according to the duration of infection. 3.2 Plant growth performance Compared to the non-AMF treatment, the plant growth performance including the plant height, stem diameter, biomass of leaves, stems and roots, as well as the leaf numbers (except at 4 w), exhibited significant increase in AMF treatment seedlings, regardless of inoculation times ( Table 2 ). Moreover, those growth indexes showed a continuous increase with the extension of AMF inoculation time. 3.3 Root architecture Compared to the non-AMF treatment, the AMF treatment exhibited markedly higher root morphological parameters than that in non-AMF treatment, including the total length, and the number of lateral roots in 1 st -order and 2 nd -order of trifoliate orange root were significantly increased at 4 to 12 w, while projected area and surface area at 6 to 12 w, and volume at 8 to 12 w ( Table 3 ). In addition, regardless of inoculation with or without AMF, the total length, projected area, surface area and volume exhibited significantly increase with treatment duration. Whereas AMF inoculation did not affect the root diameter and tap-root length throughout the entire growth process. 3.4 Root hair morphology AMF inoculation notably increased the root hair density in the 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm root regions, with increases of 22.19 % and 75.78 % at 10 w, and 32.19 % and 71.41 % at 12 w, respectively, compared to the non-AMF treatment ( Fig. 3 ; Table 4 ). However, a notable decrease was observed in the 0.5–2 cm and 4–6 cm root regions at 4 w, 6 w and 8 w, and in the 2–4 cm root region at 6 w. The root hair length was notably higher in the AMF treatment compared to the non-AMF treatment, with increases of 81.31 %, 75.10 % and 18.22 % in the 0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm, and 4–6 cm root regions at 10 w, respectively, and 84.45 % and 54.52 % in the 0.5–2 cm and 2–4 cm root regions at 12 w. However, root hair length was significantly reduced in all the root regions (0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm) at 4 w, 6 w and 8 w under the AMF treatment. AMF inoculation led to a significant increase in the root hair diameter: by 22.01 % in the 4–6 cm root regions at 6 w; by 45.77 %, 22.65 %, and 8.53 % in the 0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm, and 4–6 cm root regions, respectively, at 10 w; and by 14.10 % and 33.45 % in the 0.5–2 cm and 2–4 cm root regions, respectively, at 12 w. However, there was a decrease in root hair diameter: by 10.55 % in the 4–6 cm root region at 4 w; by 26.48 %, 18.52 %, and 9.36 % in the 0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm, and 4–6 cm root regions, respectively, at 8 w; and by 11.18 % in the 4–6 cm root region at 12 w. Overall, the root hair density of non-AMF treatment showed an increasing trend during the initial 4–8 w period, followed by a decline with prolonged growth. In contrast, the AMF treatment showed a consistently increasing trend over time. Both the AMF and non-AMF treatment seedlings performed the highest root hair density in the 4–6 cm root regions. 3.5 IAA content Compared with the non-AMF treatment, the IAA content in the 0–0.5 cm, 0.5–2 cm, 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm root regions exhibited notable increased at 4 w, 6 w, 8 w, 10 w and 12 w upon AMF inoculation ( Fig. 4 a–d). The increase ranged from 248.21 % to 439.22 % in the 0–0.5 cm root regions, from 263.14 % to 351.20 % in the 0.5–2 cm root regions, from 196.26 % to 261.19 % in the 2–4 cm root regions, and from 176.70 % to 260.01 % in the 4–6 cm root regions. Furthermore, the IAA content gradually increased with the prolongation of infection times, regardless of whether AMF was inoculated or not. 3.6 IAA flux rate At 4 w, the IAA flux rate showed efflux in the 0–0.5 cm root regions but displayed influx in the remaining the root regions in the non-AMF treatment ( Fig. 5 a–h). Conversely, the AMF treatment exhibited a higher IAA influx rate in the 0–0.5 cm and 0.5–2 cm root regions, with a relatively stable influx and efflux rate in the 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm root regions. At 6 w and 8 w, the IAA flux showed influx in all four different root regions in both the non-AMF and AMF treatments, albeit with a consistently lower influx rate in the AMF treatment compared to the non-AMF treatment in the same root regions. At 10 w, the IAA flux trend differed from previous weeks, exhibiting IAA efflux in both non-AMF and AMF treatments, with the efflux rate constantly lower in the AMF treatment seedlings than that in the non-AMF treatment seedlings in the same root regions. At 12 w, the IAA flux performance behaved completely opposite between the non-AMF and AMF treatments. It showed efflux in the 0–0.5 cm, 0.5–2 cm, and 4–6 cm root regions and influx in the 2–4 cm root regions in the non-AMF treatment, whereas it was revealed an influx in the 0–0.5 cm, 0.5–2 cm and 4–6 cm and efflux in 2–4 cm root regions in the AMF treatment. 3.7 Transcript levels of IAA carrier genes in roots Compared with the non-AMF treatment, the AMF treatment significantly down-regulated the expression of PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 by 1.43-fold, 2.57-fold, 2.04-fold and 2.19-fold, respectively, but significantly up-regulated the expression of PtPIN2 and PtPIN5 by 2.2-fold and 1.35-fold, respectively, at 4 w ( Fig. 6 a). The expression of PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN3, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 were notably up-regulated at 6 w by 2.29-fold, 1.69-fold, 1.78-fold, 1.44-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, and by 2.03-fold, 3.1-fold, 2.14-fold, 1.99-fold and 1.34-fold at 8 w under AMF treatment. Additionally, the expression of PtPIN5 was also dramatically up-regulated by 2.03-fold at 6 w ( Fig. 6 b, c). Moreover, following AMF colonization, the relative expression of PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN3 , and PtPIN6 were reasonably up-regulated by 7.37-fold, 1.44-fold, 1.38-fold, and 2.65-fold, respectively, while the expression of PtPIN8 was down-regulated by 2.04-fold at 10 w under the AMF treatment ( Fig. 6 d). At 12 w, AMF colonization prominently up-regulated the expression of PtPIN1b and PtPIN3 by 1.23-fold and 1.47-fold, respectively, while down-regulated the expression of PtPIN1c, PtPIN2, PtPIN5, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 by 1.23-fold, 1.88-fold, 1.29-fold, 1.24-fold and 1.79-fold, respectively. 3.8 Correlation analysis PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 were found to have a significant negative correlation with the total IAA flow rate, but a positive correlation with the total root hair density and length at 6 w (except PtPIN1b ), according to the correlation analysis ( Fig. 7 a). Meanwhile, PtPIN2 and PtPIN5 showed a significant positive correlation with the total IAA flow rate, and negative correlations with the total root hair density and length. After 6 w of treatment, PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN3, PtPIN5, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 showed a broader range of positive correlations with the total IAA flow rate, and negative correlations with the total root hair density and length ( Fig. 7 b). Additionally, a positive correlation was found between PtPIN1c, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 and the total root hair diameter. Additionally, at 8 w, PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN3, PtPIN6 , and PtPIN8 markedly positively correlated with the total IAA flow rate but notably negatively correlated with the total root hair density ( Fig. 7 c). According to Fig. 7 d, by 10 w, there was a significant negative correlation between the total IAA flow rate and PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN3 , and PtPIN6 , and a positive correlation with PtPIN8 ( Fig. 7 d). Additionally, the total root hair variables showed a negative correlation with PtPIN8 , but a positive correlation with PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN3 , and PtPIN6 . The total IAA flow rate at 12 w showed a significant negative correlation with PtPIN1b and PtPIN3 , and a positive correlation with PtPIN1c, PtPIN2, PtPIN5, PtPIN6 , and PtPIN8 ( Fig. 7 e). The total root hair variables and PtPINs had correlations that were precisely opposite to the total IAA flow rate. 4 Discussion In the present study, the AMF-colonized trifoliate orange seedlings showed a proliferation of hyphal structures in the roots, both internally and externally ( Fig. 1 a–e). These structures increase nutrient availability, with the extensive network of extraradical hyphae acting as the primary conduit for better nutrient absorption in the host plant ( Selosse et al., 2006 ). The present study showed minimum mycorrhizal colonization of 36.44 % ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that AMF effectively colonized the trifoliate orange roots, as the threshold for AMF colonization to produce significant benefits to host plants is typically 20–30 % ( Feldmann et al., 2009 ). Arbuscular is a nutrient exchange apparatus that was formed by terminal repetition branches of intraradical hyphae and surrounded by an invaginated host plasma membrane ( Wang et al., 2017 ). Lipids are the main form of carbon source provided by host plants for AMF development, always stored in vesicles, which can stimulate the external hyphae growth and branching ( Kameoka et al., 2022 ). In this study, the trifoliate orange roots produced more pronounced arbuscular and vesicle structures as the AMF inoculation time increased ( Fig. 1 f, g), indicating a flourishing nutrient exchange AMF and host plants. Additionally, spores, serving as asexual propagule of AMF, can carry hundreds to thousands of haploid nucleuses per spore ( Kameoka et al., 2022 ), and their numbers also increased during the later stage of the AMF treatment ( Fig. 1 h). This finding emphasizes the importance of spore proliferation in the spread of AMF within trifoliate orange roots in our study. The present study showed that the colonization of AMF significantly promoted the plant growth performance and root architecture. Throughout the treatment periods, the total root length, projected area, surface area, volume and the number of 2 nd -order lateral roots in trifoliate orange seedlings increased significantly, with the promotion effect becoming more pronounced as treatment time was extended. These findings highlight the critical role of AMF in supporting host plant growth and development. Extraradical hyphae's slender and developed characteristics enable them to easily traverse between soil particles, by passing the nutrient depletion zone ( Zhu et al., 2022 ). They also facilitate nutrient redistribution between or within plants by connecting individual plant ( Selosse et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, AMF-induced improvements in root architecture improve nutrient uptake and utilization efficiency ( Wu et al., 2012 ), with auxins playing a critical role in these process ( Hu et al., 2021 ). In this experiment, the root IAA content of the trifoliate orange seedlings increased significantly and continuously increased as the AMF treatment was extended, which corresponded to the observed growth performance of the trifoliate orange seedlings. This suggested that IAA was involved in the AMF-induced growth promotion process. And the changes in root mycorrhizal infection rates of the trifoliate orange seedlings did not consistently align with the plant growth status and root morphology parameters. The relative growth rate of a few parameters decreased in the early stage of the AMF treatment, but most of the parameters still showed higher relative growth rate in the later stage of the AMF treatment. This discrepancy may be attributed to the carbon source obtained by AMF from the host ( Wang et al., 2017 ). In the early stage of colonization, AMF may require more carbon sources from the host plant to establish symbiotic structures, as the underdeveloped symbiotic structures do not provide excessive nutrients to the host plant. As symbiotic structures continue to develop, the mycorrhizal colonization rate also increases. However, higher mycorrhizal colonization rates may induce greater carbon costs, thereby reducing the benefits conferred by AMF colonization ( Garrido et al., 2010 ). But the carbon benefits of AMF colonization to host plants cannot be ignored. Previous study has indicated a positive correlation between the difference in carbon gains between the AMF and non-AMF treatments and mycorrhizal colonization rates ( Miller et al., 2002 ). Nonetheless, it remains controversial to solely judge the effectiveness of AMF based on mycorrhizal colonization rates, as numerous factors influence root AMF infection and its benefits to plants ( Treseder, 2013 ). Briefly, the relative growth rate of the trifoliate orange seedlings increased more prominently in the later stage of AMF treatment, indicating that the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on growth promotion cannot negligible. It is noteworthy to investigate the observed root dynamics in AMF-colonized plants, where previous studies have reported an increase in both the root diameter and lateral root numbers ( Bergmann et al., 2020 ; Chiu et al., 2022 ). However, in the present study, AMF inoculation had no effect on the average diameter, which remained <1 mm, but significantly increased the lateral root numbers of the trifoliate orange seedlings. As previously reported ( Bergmann et al., 2020 ), AMF may increase root diameter to expand colonization surface, whereas trifoliate orange may limit root thickening to reduce carbon costs, as the fine roots with diameters <2 mm show strong physiological activity, which is essential for nutrient and water uptake ( Iversen et al., 2017 ). In addition, the trifoliate orange belongs to the category of thicker absorbing roots, which have less root plasticity and a higher dependence on AMF than that who had fine root ( Li et al., 2017 ; Eissenstat et al. 2015 ). In addition, the root hairs are essential for water and nutrient uptake ( Kohli et al., 2022 ). In the present study, AMF dramatically inhibited the root hair growth at 4 w, 6 w and 8 w, but significantly improved it at 10 w and 12 w ( Table 4 ), consistent with the previous study on maize ( Kothari et al., 1990 ). Probably, the presence of symbiotic structures provided more nutrients for early-stage host plant growth during AMF infection ( Zhu et al., 2022 ), leading to a higher dependence on AMF and thus limiting the root hair growth. However, only the development of root hairs can provide for the survival of early trifoliate orange seedlings with underdeveloped lateral roots under non-AMF treatments. Additionally, the functional similarity between AMF and root hairs establishes a competitive relationship between them ( Johnson et al., 2015 ). For its own survival, AMF may seek more symbiotic opportunities to inhibit the root hair development ( Kothari et al., 1990 ). Howbeit, the improvement of the root architecture in trifoliate orange enhanced its nutrient uptake capacity with prolonged AMF infection time, while reducing the carbon cost of AMF colonization by promoting the root hair development because root hairs require a smaller amount of carbon source than AMF ( Johnson et al., 2015 ). In contrast, the trifoliate orange seedlings under Non - AMF treatment chose the latter between root hairs and well-developed lateral roots at a later stage. Research has demonstrated that auxins play a central role in the regulation of root hairs development ( Lee et al., 2013 ). However, it was puzzling that although the root IAA content significantly increased throughout the treatment periods, AMF only promoted root hair development in the later stage (10 w and 12 w). One speculation is that this discrepancy may be due to auxin's influence on ethylene, which indirectly affects the root hair development. Previous studies have revealed that elevated ethylene levels can increase the root hair length and density, particularly under high auxins concentration conditions ( Ma et al., 2001 ). In addition, this might be associated with intracellular auxins levels mediated by auxins transporter proteins ( Cho et al., 2007 ). Previous study also shown that increased auxins influx activity or decreased efflux activity promotes the root hair development, while the opposite inhibits it ( Cho et al., 2007 ). These findings suggest that within a certain range, higher intracellular auxins levels correlate with the superior root hair development, and vice versa ( Velasquez et al., 2016 ). These provided a well explanation for root hair growth and auxins changes during different growth stages in this study. Previous study has demonstrated that the overexpression of PIN1/2/3/4/7/8 inhibits root hair growth in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). In this study, despite significant downregulation of PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c, PtPIN6 and PtPIN8 , and dramatic upregulation of PtPIN2 and PtPIN5 after 4 w of AMF treatment, a decline was observed in both the IAA influx flow rate in the 2–4 cm and 4–6 cm root regions and most root hair growth indexes. Although upregulation of PIN2 generally promotes auxin flow from the stele to the elongation zone ( Yuan et al., 2020 ), and may increase IAA content in this zone, it still has not changed the poor development of root hairs in the elongation zone. This suggests that the increased PtPIN2 expression might decrease IAA content in hairy cells, thereby inhibiting root hair development ( Schlicht et al., 2008 ). Notably, PtPIN2 is the only PIN family member expressed in root epidermal cells, and exists within both the root and non-root hair cells ( Luschnig et al., 1998 ), indicating that its upregulation has a more pronounced inhibitory effect on root hair development compared to the downregulation of other family members. Most PtPINs were significantly up-regulated at 6 w and 8 w of AMF treatment, where, even though the increase of PIN3 proteins which are located in the plasma membrane of the lateral cells contributes to the lateral transport of auxin, which may increase the auxin content between root epidermal cells, its efflux effect on auxin in cells is unquestionable ( Friml et al., 2002 ). And the up-regulated PtPINs expressions were positively correlated with the reduced the total IAA influx rate but negatively correlated with the reduced the total root hair growth indexes. This suggests that the reduced intracellular IAA levels regulated by PtPINs up-regulation inhibited root hair development, consistent with the previous finding ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). Additionally, the increase of PIN5 and PIN8 proteins, predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum, likely contributed to the homeostasis of auxin in cells ( Křeček et al., 2009 ), which may explain the subtle changes in root hair development observed at 4 w, 6 w and 8 w post-AMF treatment. At 10 w of AMF treatment, the expression of PtPIN8 was significantly down-regulated, while the expression of PtPIN1/3/6 remained significantly up-regulated ( Fig. 6 ). Correlation analysis indicated that PtPIN8 had a positive correlation with the reduced total IAA efflux rate but a negative correlation with the increased total root hair growth indexes, which was consistent with the previous results on the trifoliate orange seedlings ( Liu et al., 2018a ). This indicates that higher intracellular auxin levels, regulated by PtPIN8 , likely enhanced root hair development. Moreover, the significantly down-regulated expression of PtPIN8 may have a stronger promoting effect on root hair development than the significantly up-regulated expression of PtPIN1b, PtPIN1c and PtPIN3 in inhibition effect, even though the inhibition efficiency can exceed 90 % when PIN1, PIN3 , and PIN8 are overexpressed ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). This may be because the significant down-regulation of PIN8 , while PIN5 was not significantly expressed, disrupted the intracellular auxin homeostasis ( Křeček et al., 2009 ), resulting in increased intracellular auxin levels, thus promoted root hair development. Similar results were found at 12 w of treatment. At 12 w of the AMF treatment, the expressions of PtPIN1c, PtPIN2, PtPIN5, PtPIN6 , and PtPIN8 were significantly down-regulated, while PtPIN1b and PtPIN3 were significantly up-regulated. The significant down-regulation of PtPINs was positively correlated with the increased total IAA influx rate and negatively correlated with the increased total root hair growth indexes, further demonstrating that the root hair development was regulated by intracellular auxins levels. It is puzzling that even though the down-regulation of PtPINs after 12 w of AMF treatment was stronger than that at 10 w, only the root hair density increased relatively significantly at 12 w, while the root hair diameter and length changed little or even decreased. This phenomenon may be related to the expression level of PIN family genes, although overexpression of some members might inhibit root hairs growth ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ), the reduced expression or loss of function may not necessarily promote root hair development. In trifoliate orange, the down-regulation of PIN2 dramatically promoted the root hair growth ( Liu et al., 2018a ), but in Arabidopsis thaliana, knocking out PIN2 resulted in shorter root hairs ( Rigas et al., 2013 ). This discrepancy may be attributed to PIN2 ’s role in mediating auxins transport from the meristem zone to the elongation zone and mature zone ( Yuan et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the polar transport of auxins from the elongation zone to the mature zone was inhibited when the expression of PIN2 is excessively reduced or absent, resulting in a decrease in auxins concentration in the root hair cells and poor root hair development. And PIN5 may have intracellular auxins transport activity in plant cells, due to being located in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Mravec et al., 2009 ). Some studies have shown that overexpression of PIN5 can faintly promote the root hair development ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). Therefore, the root hair development may be somewhat inhibited by decreased PIN5 expression, as per this conjecture. Furthermore, there has been little investigation into the effects of PIN6 on the root hair formation. The overexpression of PIN6 in the Arabidopsis thaliana does not alter the root hair formation, although it is found in hairy cells ( Cazzonelli et al., 2013 ). Moreover, the effect of pin6 deletion mutant on auxins response is contradictory ( Simon et al., 2016 ; Ditengou et al., 2018 ). This may be related to its special structure and dual localization in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and plasma membrane ( Simon et al., 2016 ). This study hypothesized that PtPIN6 might positively control root hair growth and development in the trifoliate orange seedlings. In detail, the total root hair growth indexes at 4 w and 10 w showed a decrease and an increase, respectively, which were both significantly and positively correlated with PtPIN6 , whose expression was significantly down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively. Moreover, the root hair length and diameter in certain root regions at 12 w were lower than those at 10 w, which was consistent with the trend of the relative expression of PtPIN6 . Nevertheless, the significant up-regulation of PtPIN6 at 6 w and 8 w was negatively correlated with the reduced root hair growth indexes (except for the root hair diameter after 6 w), probably, the inhibitory effect of up-regulation of PtPIN1, PtPIN3 , and PtPIN8 on root hairs was stronger than the promotional effect of up-regulation of PtPIN6 ( Ganguly et al., 2010 ). As a result, more deeply research is needed to fully understand how PtPIN6 regulates the root hair production. 5 Conclusion The AMF treatment was observed to significantly increase IAA content, promoted plant growth, and improve root architecture in trifoliate orange seedlings. The increased rate of trifoliate orange growth indexes was heavily influenced by PRLC increase within a defined range. Furthermore, AMF regulated the intracellular IAA level by modulating the expression of PtPINs , which in turn impacted the root hair development. PtPIN2 and PtPIN8 played crucial roles in root hair development and exhibited a negative correlation with it, whereas PtPIN6 appeared to positively influence root hair growth. The impact of AMF on root hair development was also dependent on the duration of colonization, with notable enhancements observed after 10 w. Given these findings, PtPIN6 emerged as a critical gene in the regulation of root hair growth, underscoring the need for additional research to further elucidate its role.
