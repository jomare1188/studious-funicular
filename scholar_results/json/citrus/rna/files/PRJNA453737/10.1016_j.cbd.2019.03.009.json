    "full_text": "Temperature is an important factor influencing insect distribution. In the tropical and subtropical regions, insects always suffer the extreme temperature. Therefore, appropriate molecular response to temperature change is crucial for their survival. To understand how Diaphorina citri responds to high temperature at the molecular level, we conducted a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of D. citri under room temperature and 40 °C heat shock treatment. The RNA sequencing analysis identified a total of 451 differentially expressed genes upon heat stress, including 167 down-regulated genes and 284 up-regulated genes. Thermal stress mainly significantly induced the transcription of molecular chaperone, protein biosynthesis and oxidation resistance, including members of the heat shock protein families, ATPases, and detoxifying enzymes. This study provides a preliminary insight into the transcriptional response of D. citri to heat stress and provides a foundation for the future functional validation of genes involved in thermotolerance in this important insect pest in tropical and subtropical regions."

It also influences the development, reproduction, migration, diapause, and dormancy of insects ( Hussain et al., 2017 ).

          "The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri ) is the most serious agricultural pest attacking various Rutaceae crops, one of the leading fruit crops worldwide ( Westbrook et al., 2011 ). ACP was first described in Taiwan ( Lin, 1956 ). It is the main vector of “ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” (Las), which is the pathogen of the highly destructive Asian citrus huanglongbing (HLB) ( Grafton-Cardwell et al., 2013 ; Alves et al., 2014 ). Through natural and human-assisted transport, D. citri has been exported throughout Asia. This psyllid is currently found in many subtropical regions, including Brazil, Mexico, Costa Rica ( Hummel and Ferrin, 2010 ), much of the Caribbean ( Halbert and Núñez, 2004 ), Oceania, and the Americas ( Narouei-Khandan et al., 2016 ).",
          "In China, D. citri is spreading to the southern warmer regions and is predicted to establish populations in even warmer temperatures in the future ( Yan et al., 2015 ). Presently, D. citri is mainly distributed in southern China, including Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi, though it has also been found in Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Sichuan. In these areas, extreme temperatures usually exceed 40 °C in summer. What physiological alterations occurred in response to high temperature in D. citri has attracted significant attention. Generally, metabolism is promoted and longevity is gradually decreased with increases in temperature ( Hussain et al., 2017 ). Although many researchers have explored the basic biology and ecology of D. citri under thermal stress, the molecular responses of D. citri to high temperature is not clarified. Therefore, in order to identify the essential genes involved in the physiological process of high temperature tolerance in this psyllid, we carried out a comparative transcriptome analysis of ACP under heat shock treatment and room temperature."

For the heat treatment, we followed a previously published method ( Tomaseto et al., 2017 ). Briefly, adult psyllids were exposed to 40 °C (heat shock) for 15 min in a growth chamber. Insects exposed to 27 °C for 15 min were used as a control. There were three biological replicates for each treatment, and every replicate was performed with 25 individuals. Following the treatment, the whole body of the treated insects was used for total RNA extraction for the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol regent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One percent agarose gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the integrity of the RNA. In addition, the RNA concentration was measured using a Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The quality of the RNA was further assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA).

          "In the current study, our sampling site (Guilin, Guangxi province) is a typical subtropical region. Which is the major area that D. citri broke out in China. In our pre-experiment, all the tested psyllids encountered the heat shock comma after a 15-minute heat treatment at 40 °C without any mortality. Meanwhile, around 45% psyllids died when the treatment was extended to 20 min (data not shown). In order to avoid high mortality caused by the heat treatment, we set 15 min as the duration of the heat treatment.",
          "Temperature is an important factor affecting the geographic distribution and population abundance of insects ( Lu et al., 2016 ). As the previous study showed, the optimum temperature range for the survival of D. citri is 25–28 °C ( Grafton-Cardwell et al., 2013 ). The ACP is widely distributed in many subtropical regions in China. They are often subjected to high temperature stress. Many studies indicated that the stress related genes of insects showed transcriptional changes when exposed to extreme environments ( Díaz et al., 2015 ; Huang et al., 2017 ). In this study, the gene expression of D. citri differed substantially between the control (27 °C) and heat treatment. As a result, we found a number of important genes that were associated with thermotolerance. Briefly, 284 genes were significantly up-regulated compared to the control, while 167 genes were down-regulated. The molecular functions and biological processes affected by elevated temperature were significantly enriched based on GO analysis, and this data indicated that the expression of thermotolerance genes was induced by transient heat shock in D. citri . Based on the GO analysis, heat shock greatly influences the transcripts regulating molecular defense and/or thermotolerance metabolism. These DEGs were related to energy metabolism, protein turnover, detoxification, and stress signal transduction.",
          "HSPs are a group of proteins whose expression is correlated with environmental stress and that are highly conserved in the coding regions. HSPs are molecular chaperons involved in protein folding and refolding, stabilization of denatured proteins, and the proteolytic pathway ( King and MacRae, 2015 ). As indicators of changes in intracellular thermal stress conditions, HSPs have been reported in many studies. For example, HSP90 increased dramatically at 34 °C in Nilaparvata lugens ( Lu et al., 2016 ), while HSP70 increased following heat shock in Locusta migratoria , and Grapholita molesta ( Qin et al., 2003 ). Similar results were detected in Australian sheep blowfly ( Lucilia cuprina ) with regards to HSP22 , HSP23 , HSP70 , and HSP83 ( Concha et al., 2012 ). Several studies showed that following short-term heat shock (1 h), the expression of HSP70 was dramatically up-regulated in Musca domestic ( Tang et al., 2012 ) and Chironomus dilutes ( Karouna-Renier and Rao, 2010 ), but decreased rapidly after 2 h heat shock in C. dilutes ( Karouna-Renier and Rao, 2010 ). This might be related to the different sensitivities of HSPs to heat stress. In summary, these results implied a strong correlation between HSPs and temperature. In the present study, we found that HSP20 , HSP70 , HSP70-A1 , and HSP90 were up-regulated in D. citri upon heat shock. The up-regulation of molecular chaperone genes, such as HSPs , would help cells resist the damage inflicted by heat shock.",
          "In D. citri , genes such as ATPases (AAA), associated with ATP and cellular activities, were up-regulated upon heat shock. ATPases are associated with different cellular processes, including membrane fusion, DNA replication, proteolysis, gene expression, and signal transduction ( Esaki et al., 2017 ). These results may indicate that increased temperature accelerated cell metabolism, which is dependent on energy consumption. A study in D. melanogaster provided strong evidence that the genes associated with stress are those involved in transcriptional regulation, development, and morphogenesis ( Porcelli et al., 2015 ). Consistent with our results, increased protein biosynthesis occurred in Anopheles gambiae under elevated temperatures ( Cassone et al., 2011 ).",
          "In addition to inducing the expression of HSP genes, many studies reported that heat shock could improve the content of toxic substances. Which caused oxidative stress to insects. In Glyphodes pyloalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), after exposure to 40 °C for 4 h, the up-regulated genes included not only HSPs, but also detoxification-related genes, such as 4 glutathione S -transferases and cytochrome P450s (CYPs). This suggested that CYPs and GST play an important role in the heat shock response ( Liu et al., 2017 ). In many insect species, CYPs play an important role in many oxidative processes, including lipid peroxidation, fatty acid metabolism, and sterol synthesis. In addition, GST was reported to be involved in the inactivation of toxic lipid peroxidation products synthesized by oxidative damage and xenobiotics treatment ( Qin et al., 2013 ). Thus, the up-regulation of CYPs may be essential for tolerating heat shock and can regulate intracellular oxidative stress and cellular toxic substance metabolism. Increased expression levels of GST were observed in Panonychus citri and Aphidius gifuensis following exposure to high temperature ( Kang et al., 2017 ). Similarly, elevated expression of CYP, GST, and fatty acid synthase was detected in the present study ( Table 4 ). This indicated that a short term exposure to high temperature induced a response in D. citri . A comparison of these results suggested that antioxidant enzyme systems play an important role in the antioxidant reaction at high temperature. In addition, we found that the number of DEGs and their levels of up-regulation in different insects differed compared to other researches, which may be related to exposure time and species."

The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri ) is the most serious agricultural pest attacking various Rutaceae crops, one of the leading fruit crops worldwide ( Westbrook et al., 2011 ). ACP was first described in Taiwan ( Lin, 1956 ). It is the main vector of “ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” (Las), which is the pathogen of the highly destructive Asian citrus huanglongbing (HLB) ( Grafton-Cardwell et al., 2013 ; Alves et al., 2014 ). Through natural and human-assisted transport, D. citri has been exported throughout Asia. This psyllid is currently found in many subtropical regions, including Brazil, Mexico, Costa Rica ( Hummel and Ferrin, 2010 ), much of the Caribbean ( Halbert and Núñez, 2004 ), Oceania, and the Americas ( Narouei-Khandan et al., 2016 ). In China, D. citri is spreading to the southern warmer regions and is predicted to establish populations in even warmer temperatures in the future ( Yan et al., 2015 ). Presently, D. citri is mainly distributed in southern China, including Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi, though it has also been found in Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Sichuan. In these areas, extreme temperatures usually exceed 40 °C in summer. What physiological alterations occurred in response to high temperature in D. citri has attracted significant attention. Generally, metabolism is promoted and longevity is gradually decreased with increases in temperature ( Hussain et al., 2017 ). Although many researchers have explored the basic biology and ecology of D. citri under thermal stress, the molecular responses of D. citri to high temperature is not clarified. Therefore, in order to identify the essential genes involved in the physiological process of high temperature tolerance in this psyllid, we carried out a comparative transcriptome analysis of ACP under heat shock treatment and room temperature. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sample preparation and RNA extraction ACPs were collected from Tanxia town, Lingchuan County, Guilin City, Guangxi Autonomous Region (25°27′58′′N, 110°15′49″E), on 22 September 2017. For the heat treatment, we followed a previously published method ( Tomaseto et al., 2017 ). Briefly, adult psyllids were exposed to 40 °C (heat shock) for 15 min in a growth chamber. Insects exposed to 27 °C for 15 min were used as a control. There were three biological replicates for each treatment, and every replicate was performed with 25 individuals. Following the treatment, the whole body of the treated insects was used for total RNA extraction for the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol regent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One percent agarose gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the integrity of the RNA. In addition, the RNA concentration was measured using a Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The quality of the RNA was further assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The cDNA for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was synthesized using the PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis System (Takara Biotechnology Dalian Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) using 1 μg of total RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. 2.2 Construction of the cDNA library and Illumina sequencing A total amount of 3 μg RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparation for transcriptome sequencing. The sequencing libraries were generated using a NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB USA). Poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads were used to purify the mRNA from the total RNA. Afterwards, the first-strand cDNA and second-strand cDNA were respectively synthesized. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) was used to perform clustering of the index-coded samples. Subsequently, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and 125/150 bp paired-end reads were generated. 2.3 Data filtering and reads mapping Raw data in fastq format were filtered using in-house Perl scripts. The clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing poly-N, reads containing adapters, and low quality reads from the raw data ( Garber et al., 2011 ). We then used the reference genome and gene model annotation files downloaded from the genome website ( ftp://ftp.citrusgreening.org/genomes/Diaphorina_citri/assembly/ ) for the genome mapping. Hisat2 v2.0.5 ( https://anaconda.org/biobuilds/hisat2 ) was used to build the index of the reference genome and align the paired-end clean reads with the reference genome ( Trapnell et al., 2009 ). This generated a database of splice junctions based on the gene model annotation file. 2.4 Gene expression quantification The Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Million (FPKM) base pairs sequenced of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to the gene. The assembled transcriptome of the heat shock treatment samples was compared with that of the control. Differential expression analysis between the treatment and control was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.16.1) ( Varet et al., 2016 ). DESeq2 provides statistical routines for determining differential expression in digital gene expression data using a model based on the negative binomial distribution ( Anders and Huber, 2010 ). The resulting P -values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg's approach for controlling the false discovery rate. Genes with an adjusted P -value ( P adj) < 0.05 as determined by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed. 2.5 Gene ontology analysis of the DEGs Additionally, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used for GO enrichment analysis to identify the pathways that the DEGs were predicted to be involved in. The clusterProfiler R package, which implements the Gene Ontology (GO) terms, was used for the enrichment analysis of the DEGs at different temperatures ( Zheng and Wang, 2008 ). Specifically, the gene lengths of these DEGs were corrected. We took log2 (FPKM+1) of the expressions of the differentially expressed genes and cluster them after centralized correction by using the H-cluster method. Cluster analysis was used to determine the expression patterns of the DEGs under the different experimental conditions. Based on the clustering, the genes with the same or similar expression patterns and the function of unknown genes or unknown functions of known genes could be determined. These genes may have similar functions, or they may be involved in the same metabolic process or cellular pathway. 2.6 RT-qPCR validation The transcriptome data showed that 451 genes were differentially expressed. We selected seven genes from different gene function categories exhibiting different degrees of up-regulation to verify the validity of the RNA-Seq data. These genes included HSP20 , HSP70 , HSP70-A1 , HSP90 , transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 4-like ( TAF4-like ), ribonucleoprotein PTB-binding 2-like ( PTB ), and guanine nucleotide-binding protein G ( s ) subunit alpha ( Gsα ). Novostar-SYBR Supermix (Novoprotein, Shanghai, China) was used in the RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from each treatment using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of total RNA using the PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis System (Takara Biotechnology Dalian Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) following the manufacturer's protocol. The primers used for RT-qPCR detection were designed in Primer 3.0 ( http://primer3.ut.ee/ ) and are listed in Table 2 . The cDNA extracted from the adults under normal condition was used as the template for the positive control, while the ddH 2 O served as the template for negative control. The relative quantities were normalized to the reference gene actin-1 (XM_008473151) ( Tian et al., 2018 ). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. To verify the specificity of the amplification for each primer pair, a dissociation curve was included from 60 to 95 °C at the end of each RT-qPCR run. The relative expression data were analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔCT method ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ). All quantitative PCR experiments used two technical repetitions and three biological replicates, and each sample was collected from at least 25 insects. 2.7 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the RT-qPCR was conducted in SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE). Significant differences between the control (27 °C) and heat shock groups (40 °C) were analyzed with independent sample t -tests. 3 Results 3.1 Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly To characterize the molecular response to thermal stress in D. citri , RNA-Seq was employed to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the heat shock treatment (40 °C, 15 min) compared to the control (27 °C, 15 min). As shown in Table 1 , the transcriptome assembly of D. citri generated 21–28 million unique genes for heat shock treatments and 23–31 million unique genes for the control. Following RNA purification, 20–27 million reads and 22–30 million reads were retained from the heat shock and control. Most of these qualified reads mapped directly to the full reference genome data of D. citri ( ftp://ftp.citrusgreening.org/genomes/Diaphorina_citri/assembly/ ). 3.2 DEGs and GO analysis In total, the sequencing data revealed that there were 451 DEGs ( P adj < 0.05) detected in the heat shock treatments. Among these DEGs, 167 genes were down-regulated and 284 genes were up-regulated in comparison to the control ( Fig. 1 ). The information of top 10 up-regulated genes were also listed in Fig. 1 . Specific information relating to the DEGs (e.g., HSP20 , HSP70 ) is listed in Additional File 1 . GO terms were used in the enrichment analysis to elucidate the functional clusters and biochemical pathways of these DEGs. In total, the sequencing data revealed that there were 451 DEGs ( P adj < 0.05) detected in the heat shock treatments. Among these DEGs, 167 genes were down-regulated and 284 genes were up-regulated in comparison to the control ( Fig. 1 ). The information of top 10 up-regulated genes were also listed in Fig. 1 .

GO terms were used in the enrichment analysis to elucidate the functional clusters and biochemical pathways of these DEGs. GO terms with P adj < 0.05 were considered as significantly enriched. These DEGs were classified in three terms, namely Biological Processes, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component. Within the Biology Processes, the main groupings of the 193 categories included ‘DNA replication’ and ‘DNA metabolic process’, while of the 54 categories for Cellular Component, ‘intracellular membrane-bounded organelle’, ‘membrane-bounded organelle’ and ‘protein complex’ were the most abundant. For Molecular Function, ‘DNA binding’, ‘transferase activity, transferring phosphorus-containing groups’ and ‘transition metal ion binding’ were the most prevalent of the 148 categories. Here in Additional File 2 , we listed the top 10 categories for each of the three GO terms according to the significance. Overall, typical functions, such as energy metabolism, ion transport, and gene regulation, were indicated by the GO terms. In addition to that, we found some genes associated with the ROS ( Table 4 ). GO terms with P adj < 0.05 were considered as significantly enriched.

In addition to that, we found some genes associated with the ROS ( Table 4 ). 3.3 RT-qPCR validation and response of the HSP family According to the DEG analysis, we selected seven genes, including HSPs, from 451 DEGs to validate the DEG data ( Table 3 ). As expected, the results of the RT-qPCR were basically consistent with the RNA-Seq data ( Fig. 2 ). This result confirmed the reliability of the RNA-Seq data obtained in this study. In D. citri , thermal stress significantly induced several HSP genes under 40 °C for 15 min. For instance, HSP20 was up-regulated 54.42 times, HSP70-A1 was up-regulated 15.93 times, and HSP90 was up-regulated 2.69 times. In this study, the expression of HSP20 and HSP70-A1 showed significant increases in both the RT-qPCR and RNA-Seq analyses. 4 Discussion In the current study, our sampling site (Guilin, Guangxi province) is a typical subtropical region. Which is the major area that D. citri broke out in China. In our pre-experiment, all the tested psyllids encountered the heat shock comma after a 15-minute heat treatment at 40 °C without any mortality. Meanwhile, around 45% psyllids died when the treatment was extended to 20 min (data not shown). In order to avoid high mortality caused by the heat treatment, we set 15 min as the duration of the heat treatment. Temperature is an important factor affecting the geographic distribution and population abundance of insects ( Lu et al., 2016 ). As the previous study showed, the optimum temperature range for the survival of D. citri is 25–28 °C ( Grafton-Cardwell et al., 2013 ). The ACP is widely distributed in many subtropical regions in China. They are often subjected to high temperature stress. Many studies indicated that the stress related genes of insects showed transcriptional changes when exposed to extreme environments ( Díaz et al., 2015 ; Huang et al., 2017 ). In this study, the gene expression of D. citri differed substantially between the control (27 °C) and heat treatment. As a result, we found a number of important genes that were associated with thermotolerance. Briefly, 284 genes were significantly up-regulated compared to the control, while 167 genes were down-regulated. The molecular functions and biological processes affected by elevated temperature were significantly enriched based on GO analysis, and this data indicated that the expression of thermotolerance genes was induced by transient heat shock in D. citri . Based on the GO analysis, heat shock greatly influences the transcripts regulating molecular defense and/or thermotolerance metabolism. These DEGs were related to energy metabolism, protein turnover, detoxification, and stress signal transduction. HSPs are a group of proteins whose expression is correlated with environmental stress and that are highly conserved in the coding regions. HSPs are molecular chaperons involved in protein folding and refolding, stabilization of denatured proteins, and the proteolytic pathway ( King and MacRae, 2015 ). As indicators of changes in intracellular thermal stress conditions, HSPs have been reported in many studies. For example, HSP90 increased dramatically at 34 °C in Nilaparvata lugens ( Lu et al., 2016 ), while HSP70 increased following heat shock in Locusta migratoria , and Grapholita molesta ( Qin et al., 2003 ). Similar results were detected in Australian sheep blowfly ( Lucilia cuprina ) with regards to HSP22 , HSP23 , HSP70 , and HSP83 ( Concha et al., 2012 ). Several studies showed that following short-term heat shock (1 h), the expression of HSP70 was dramatically up-regulated in Musca domestic ( Tang et al., 2012 ) and Chironomus dilutes ( Karouna-Renier and Rao, 2010 ), but decreased rapidly after 2 h heat shock in C. dilutes ( Karouna-Renier and Rao, 2010 ). This might be related to the different sensitivities of HSPs to heat stress. In summary, these results implied a strong correlation between HSPs and temperature. In the present study, we found that HSP20 , HSP70 , HSP70-A1 , and HSP90 were up-regulated in D. citri upon heat shock. The up-regulation of molecular chaperone genes, such as HSPs , would help cells resist the damage inflicted by heat shock. In D. citri , genes such as ATPases (AAA), associated with ATP and cellular activities, were up-regulated upon heat shock. ATPases are associated with different cellular processes, including membrane fusion, DNA replication, proteolysis, gene expression, and signal transduction ( Esaki et al., 2017 ). These results may indicate that increased temperature accelerated cell metabolism, which is dependent on energy consumption. A study in D. melanogaster provided strong evidence that the genes associated with stress are those involved in transcriptional regulation, development, and morphogenesis ( Porcelli et al., 2015 ). Consistent with our results, increased protein biosynthesis occurred in Anopheles gambiae under elevated temperatures ( Cassone et al., 2011 ). In addition to inducing the expression of HSP genes, many studies reported that heat shock could improve the content of toxic substances. Which caused oxidative stress to insects. In Glyphodes pyloalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), after exposure to 40 °C for 4 h, the up-regulated genes included not only HSPs, but also detoxification-related genes, such as 4 glutathione S -transferases and cytochrome P450s (CYPs). This suggested that CYPs and GST play an important role in the heat shock response ( Liu et al., 2017 ). In many insect species, CYPs play an important role in many oxidative processes, including lipid peroxidation, fatty acid metabolism, and sterol synthesis. In addition, GST was reported to be involved in the inactivation of toxic lipid peroxidation products synthesized by oxidative damage and xenobiotics treatment ( Qin et al., 2013 ). Thus, the up-regulation of CYPs may be essential for tolerating heat shock and can regulate intracellular oxidative stress and cellular toxic substance metabolism. Increased expression levels of GST were observed in Panonychus citri and Aphidius gifuensis following exposure to high temperature ( Kang et al., 2017 ). Similarly, elevated expression of CYP, GST, and fatty acid synthase was detected in the present study ( Table 4 ). This indicated that a short term exposure to high temperature induced a response in D. citri . A comparison of these results suggested that antioxidant enzyme systems play an important role in the antioxidant reaction at high temperature. In addition, we found that the number of DEGs and their levels of up-regulation in different insects differed compared to other researches, which may be related to exposure time and species. 5 Conclusions The expression of stress related gene families can be triggered in insects in response to harsh environmental conditions. Temperature is one of the most important environmental and ecological factors influencing the physiological metabolism of insects. In summary, we discovered a number of genes such as HSPs, ATPases, P450, and GSTs potentially involved in the response and protection against the thermal stress in D. citri .
