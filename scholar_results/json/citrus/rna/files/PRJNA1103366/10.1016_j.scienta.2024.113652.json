    "full_text": "Color is a crucial component of the commercial value of citrus fruits. Carotenoid cleavage oxygenases ( CCOs ) can affect fruit color by oxidative cleavage of different carotenoid sites, resulting in various colors. This study proposed a genome-wide analysis of the Orah mandarin CCO gene family using bioinformatics methods and combined physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data to analyze the gene expression levels and carotenoid accumulation mechanisms of different colored peel. A total of 14 CCOs were identified in the Orah mandarin genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CrCCOs can be classified into six subfamilies, and the gene structure and conserved motifs support the above classification. GO and KEGG functional annotation revealed that Orah mandarin CCO genes play crucial roles in carotenoid synthesis and catabolism. Transcriptomic data showed that the expression level of CrCCD4b1 was positively correlated with the current status of Orah mandarin red flavedo. Physiological and metabolomic studies further revealed that apocarotenal and β-citraurin were identified as the key metabolites controlling the change in flavedo color from yellow to red. Correlation analysis revealed CrCCD4b1 as a crucial gene in the apocarotenal and β-citraurin expression network. For the first time, we proposed CrCCD4b1 as a potential model for increasing red carotenoid accumulation in the flavedo by promoting the biosynthesis of C30 carotenoids (apocarotenal, β-citraurin) in Orah mandarin. This study will lay the foundation for further research on the causes of differences in peel color and the mining of crucial genes regulating the red trait."

          "Citrus is one of the world's four main fruits. In 2022, China had a citrus planting area of more than three million hectares, an output of more than 60 million tons, and a peel color as a crucial indicator of the quality of the consumer's most intuitive sensory experience, which directly determines the economic benefits of the fruit ( M.J. Rodrigo et al., 2013 ; Sun et al., 2023 ). The peels of mature citrus fruits are sometimes red and sometimes yellow or orange, which affects the market popularity of the fruits. In the production process, researchers have found significant differences in fruit appearance and coloration between different fruiting parts of trees, in which light conditions may be the main influencing factor ( Jia et al., 2021 ).",
          "The development of citrus fruit color is physiologically related to chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin metabolism, of which the content and composition of carotenoids are the main factors affecting coloration in most citrus ( Huang et al., 2022 ). Carotenoids are formed with 40 carbon atoms as the fundamental skeleton and isoprene as the basic unit connected by multiple conjugated double bonds, and the number of conjugated double bonds is closely related to the color of carotenoids ( Sun et al., 2022 ). Carotenoid cleavage oxygenase ( CCO ) genes are widely involved in fruit color regulation ( Ni et al., 2023 ). CCOs are vital enzyme-encoding genes in the carotenoid degradation process that can oxidatively cleave carotenoids at different sites, thereby generating different carotenoid metabolites, which is one of the prime pathways of carotenoid degradation in organisms ( González-Verdejo et al., 2015 ; Lado et al., 2016 ). It causes changes in the carotenoids in the peel, which in turn affects the appearance and color of citrus fruits. CCO genes in higher plants are a relatively small gene family, and a total of nine members of the CCO gene family were identified in the Arabidopsis genome; these genes can be further divided into two subfamilies, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) and 9-cis-epoxy carotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs), based on the presence or absence of epoxidation of their catalytic substrates, including four subfamilies of CCDs (CCD1, CCD4, CCD7 and CCD8) and one subfamily of NCEDs (NCED2, NCED3, NCED5, NCED6 and NCED9) ( Wei et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). Based on the Arabidopsis CCO gene family, homologs found in other plants have since been named based on the homology of the gene to the Arabidopsis CCO genes.",
          "The CCO gene family is a class of nonheme iron oxidases whose catalytic activity requires the assistance of Fe 2+ to bind four histidines to accomplish oxidative cleavage ( Khadka et al., 2019 ; Sui et al., 2015 ). These members of the CCO family have different substrate specificities for carotenoids and differ in the double-bond site of oxidative cleavage, which also gives rise to different cleavage products. CCD1 is mainly associated with the formation of aroma substances and can produce β-ionone, β-cyclocitral, geranylacetone, pseudoionone, and other aroma substances through the cleavage of cyclic and chain carotenoids ( Cheng et al., 2023 ; Gong et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). CCD4 can directly contact C40 carotenoid substrates to produce plant colors and aromatic compounds by cleaving their double bonds at different positions ( Rubio-Moraga et al., 2014 ). It was found that CCD4b1 of Citrus sinensis and Citrus clementina oxidized the 7′−8′ or 7,8 double bonds of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, and the products were C30 carotenoids (β-citraurin and β-citraurinene) specific to citrus, which caused the peel to exhibit a red color; moreover, the insertion of the MITE transposon in the CCD4b promoter sequence was highly positively correlated with high expression of CCD4b and the red peel trait. In addition, the presence of the MITE transposon in the CCD4b promoter sequence was strongly positively correlated with the high expression of CCD4b and the red peel trait. The insertion of this fragment caused an accumulation of C30 carotenoids, which led to the formation of the red peel trait in citrus plants ( M.J. Rodrigo et al., 2013 ; Zheng et al., 2019 , 2015 ). CCD7 and CCD8 can cleave carotenoids to produce strigolactones, while NCEDs are involved mainly in abscisic acid synthesis ( Seto et al., 2014 ; Xian et al., 2014 ). The above results indicate that the simultaneous presence of multiple CCO genes in plants, which play their respective functions in different plant tissues and jointly regulate plant carotenoid metabolism, has crucial biological functions in plant growth and development, adversity stress, and color formation and has therefore been doubly attracting the attention of researchers ( Varghese et al., 2021 ).",
          "Orah mandarin ( Citrus reticulata Blanco) is one of the late-maturing citrus varieties with the largest area in China; this variety has excellent characteristics, such as better tree strength, beautiful fruit appearance, early fruit set and high yield, excellent internal quality, late maturity, and high sugar content. Planting Orah mandarin has developed rapidly in recent years ( Li et al., 2022 ). The red color of the Orah mandarin has always been popular among consumers. However, in the actual production process, most of the ripe Orah mandarin peels in this region are yellow instead of the inherent red color, which affects the market popularity of the fruit. Currently, the CCO gene family is involved in the development of fruit color, but genome-wide identification of Orah mandarin CCOs has not been reported ( Ding et al., 2023 ). Members of the CCD4 subfamily may be involved in regulating the formation of Orah mandarin peel color. However, the effect of the expression of this gene in the peel on the variation in peel color is not known. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and study the CrCCO gene family involved in the genesis of Orah mandarin fruit color and the vital genes that regulate red skin formation. In this study, we identified the Orah mandarin CCO gene family using bioinformatics methods, and we analyzed its gene structure, conserved motifs, phylogeny, cis-regulatory elements, and GO and KEGG functional annotations, which provided a preliminary understanding of the fundamental functions and characteristics of CCO genes. In addition, the expression levels of CCO genes and carotenoid metabolites were analyzed by combining physiology, transcriptome sequencing technology, and carotenoid-targeted metabolism technology to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of fruit color changes in Orah mandarin. This study will reveal the regulatory mechanisms of metabolites during the color change of Orah mandarin fruits, which will help to promote our understanding of carotenoid metabolism in citrus fruits."

We selected 7-year-old Orah mandarin plants with uniform growth and medium fruiting capacity, a rootstock of Ziyang Xiangcheng ( Citrus junos Sieb.), a plant spacing of 2 × 4 m, and management by conventional cultivation measures. Sampling was carried out at commercial maturity (total soluble solids ≥ 12, total acid ≤ 1.1), and three fruits of different colors each from the east, south, west, north, and central directions of the tree were collected from each plant totaling 30 fruits, which were packed in black bags and transported to the laboratory, and three biological replicates were set up. Orah mandarin fruits free from mechanical damage and disease were sterilized using a sodium hypochlorite solution (4 % volume), rinsed several times in sterile water, and dried naturally. Based on the color difference, these fruits were divided into two groups, yellow and red, and the 2–3 mm thick flavedo was collected using a scalpel, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for backup.",

The L* value (brightness value), a* value (red‒greenness value), b* value (yellow‒blueness value), H ° (hue angle), and CI (color index) were recorded, where H° = arctan (b* / a*), and CI = 1000 × a * / (L* × b *) and the average value was taken for analysis. The total carotenoid content was detected using the BC4330 plant carotenoid content assay kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). One hundred milligrams of fresh fruit peels were accurately weighed, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then ground into powder using a fully automated sample freezer grinder. Then, the pigment components were fully extracted by adding an 80 % acetone solution. The filtrate was transferred to a 25 mL brown volumetric flask, and the volume was adjusted to 10 mL with an acetone solution. The above solution was added to a cuvette, and the absorbance of the extracted solution was measured at 440 nm with the acetone solution as a reference to calculate the total carotenoid content according to the formula.",

In this study, the peel color of the Orah mandarin was positively correlated with a* and CI; that is, the a* and CI of the shaded red Orah mandarin were much greater than those of the light-sufficient yellow Orah mandarin, and both these values were significant. The total carotenoid content of yellow Orah mandarin was also significantly lower than that of red Orah mandarin, and correlation analysis also revealed that a*, CI and total carotenoid content were positively correlated (R 2 > 0.95). Moreover, the greater the values of a*, CI and total carotenoid content of Orah mandarin are, the darker and redder the color of its peel is, and vice versa."

              "To identify genes associated with CrCCOs , a total of 14 CrCCO gene family members with typical RPE65 structural domains were ultimately obtained from the Orah mandarin genome, as verified by local BLAST, HMMER searches, and NCBI-CCD structural domain analysis (Table S2). These genes were named according to the homologous genes in Arabidopsis, and those without homologous genes were named CrCCD-like ( Fig. 2 ). The number of amino acids in the CrCCO gene family members ranged from 108 (CrCCD4b3) to 658 (CrCCD4a), with a mean of 497 aa. The molecular weights ranged from 12.20 kDa (CrCCD4b3) to 72.85 kDa (CrCCD4a), with a mean of 55.57 kDa. The theoretical pI ranged from 5.12 (CrCCD4b3) to 8.25 (CrCCD4C), where all CrCCOs except CrCCD4C and CrNCED6 had pIs less than seven and were presumed to be acidic proteins. Eight CrCCOs were predicted to be stable proteins with instability indices less than 40. The aliphatic indexes ranged from 77.39 (CrNCED3) to 87.61 (CrCCD4d), averaging 81.33. The average hydropathicity for all genes was less than 0, ranging from −0.394 to −0.077, suggesting that members of the CrCCO gene family are hydrophilic proteins. Subcellular localization predictions indicate that most CrCCOs may function in the chloroplast and cytoplasm (Table S2). Among them, members of the CCD1, CCD7, and CCD-like subfamilies are localized only in the cytoplasm.",
              "The Orah mandarin CCO gene family was divided into six subfamilies based on sequence similarity to homologous Arabidopsis genes: CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, NCED, and CCD-like. The CCD4 subfamily contained the greatest number of genes, containing six genes and accounting for 42.86 % of the total CCOs . In contrast, none of the other subfamilies had more than three members, and three of them, CCD1, CCD7, and CCD-like, contained only one gene, accounting for 7.14 %.",
              "In this study, a total of 14 CCOs were identified in the Orah mandarin genome, which is comparable to those of A. thaliana (9), C. clementina (14), C. sinensis (14), C. pepo (13), M. domestica (21), P. bretschneideri (22), and S. Lycopersicum (7), which were all found to have 14 members of the CCO gene family in Orah mandarin, suggesting that the number of this family changes more slowly in Orah mandarin, probably because the reproductive isolation of Orah mandarin fruits is weaker and gene exchange and expansion are too frequent. This finding also suggested that Orah mandarin has evolved in a relatively similar manner to several other species and that the same CCO genes likely perform the same functions in Citrus spp. ( Huang et al., 2023 ). It was also found that the number of members of nonwoody plants (herbs and vines) was lower than that of woody plants, while the number of CCOs in fruit trees of the Rosaceae family was much greater than that of Citrus spp. We also found that the number of the CCO gene family did not correlate with the genome size but might be related to the direction and degree of evolution of the species. In addition, information on the basic physicochemical properties and subcellular localization of CrCCO genes was provided."

              "To analyze the homology between members of the CrCCO gene family, we used ClustalW and found that protein sequences within the same subfamily had high similarity ( Fig. 3 A). For example, CCD4b1, CCD4b2, and CCD4b3 have a high degree of similarity, up to 90 %. Multiple sequence alignment analyses revealed that all CrCCOs contained four conserved histidine residues and three conserved glutamic acid residues (Figure S2).",
              "To further explore the phylogenetic relationships of the CCO gene family in Orah mandarin, the sequences of the 14 CrCCOs identified in the Orah mandarin genome as described above, as well as the sequences of AtCCO, CcCCO, CpCCO, MdCCO, PbCCO, SlCCO , and CsCCO , were used to construct a phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 3 B). Based on the topology of the phylogenetic tree, the CrCCO gene family was classified into six subfamilies, CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, NCED, and CCD-like, which is consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses of CCOs in other plants. Interestingly, no AtCCO members were found in the CCD-like subfamily, suggesting that this subfamily may only replicate and expand in certain species. Moreover, more CrCCOs are on the same branch as CcCCOs in CrCCOs than in other species, such as C. sinensis , which is hypothesized to be more closely related. The Orah mandarin CCO gene family can be classified into six subfamilies, of which CCD4 is the largest subfamily, whereas CCD1, CCD7, and CCD8, NCED, and CCD-like also contain multiple genes but with some differences in number, which is consistent with the findings of other species. Orah mandarin, C. sinensis, and C. clementina are citrus species, while the CCO gene family all have 14 members but are present in different numbers in specific subfamilies. For example, CCD4 is the largest subfamily, and both C. sinensis and C. clementina have five members, while Orah mandarin has six members; therefore, it is speculated that Orah mandarin may have increased the number of gene members in the CCD4 subfamily through evolution, which means that some of the CCO genes in the subgroup may have new functions. Combining the differences in the intrinsic colors of Orah mandarin and the function of the CCO gene, we hypothesized that the change in the color of the Orah mandarin peel was due to the expression of these CCO genes regulating the change in carotenoid content. Genes in the same subfamily in the evolutionary tree may have proteins with related biological properties and perform the same function ( Yang et al., 2024 ). Thus, if two genes are in the same subfamily, we can infer the function of the unknown gene from the gene with a known function. Currently, functional studies of C. sinensis CCO genes are relatively abundant, so homology mining and analysis of CrCCOs and CsCCOs have been the focus of research, and we can speculate on the function of one of the genes based on the remoteness of the evolutionary relationship."

              "To understand the structural and functional characteristics of the CrCCO gene family, the gene structures, conserved structural domains, and conserved motifs of all CCO genes in the Orah mandarin were analyzed. First, using 14 CCOs from Orah mandarin, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to reveal the evolutionary relationships among different members of the CCO gene family ( Fig. 4 A). According to its structure, it can be categorized into six subfamilies (among which the NCED subfamily can be further subdivided into three families), and this topology is similar to the structure of the phylogenetic tree constructed for the eight species mentioned above ( Fig. 3 B). Gene structure analysis revealed that the exon and intron structures of genes in the same branch were more similar, and the number of exons and introns differed significantly from branch to branch ( Fig. 4 C). The gene structures of CrCCO family members are diverse, suggesting having different functions in Orah mandarin growth and development. Conserved structural domain analysis revealed that all CrCCO genes contain an RPE65 structural domain ( Fig. 4 C).",
              "In the conserved motif analysis, ten different motifs with 21–41 amino acid residues were retrieved from the Orah mandarin CCO gene family using the MEME tool, with each CCO gene containing at least one conserved motif ( Fig. 4 B). Notably, to obtain a better picture of motif composition among the different groups (CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, NCED3, NCED5, NCED6, and CCD-like), we counted the number of motifs contained in each subfamily member. The results revealed significant differences in motif composition and number among the different groups. Notably, 92.9 % of all CrCCO proteins contained Motif1 and Motif2, indicating that these two motifs were the most common among the various family members and suggesting playing crucial roles in some biological functions. However, combining the results of the phylogenetic tree and motif analysis, we found that motif composition and number were not always highly conserved across subfamilies. For example, the CCD8 subfamily has only one less Motif4 than the CCD-like subfamily; thus, it is hypothesized that the CCD-like subfamily may have arisen from mutations in the CCD8 subfamily. In addition, among all CrCCO gene family members, all CCOs had 5–10 motifs, except for one CCO member, which contained only three motifs. These results suggest that the evolutionarily closely related CrCCO genes have similar motif compositions.",
              "Based on phylogenetic analyses of the gene structures, conserved structural domains, and conserved motifs of 14 CrCCOs, it was found that CrCCOs of the same subfamily have similar gene structures and motif compositions, and there are significant differences between different subfamilies, which further validates the categorization and phylogeny of CCOs . Most CrCCOs contain Motif1 and Motif2. Hence, these genes may share some of the same functions, but at the same time, there are many different Motifs, which may account for functional divergence during evolution. Notably, one of the six members of the CCD4 subfamily contains only Motif9, Motif6, and Motif1, significantly different from the other members in motif composition and number. In addition, in combination with the phenomenon that all the other citrus fruit trees in the CCD4 subfamily have only five members, it is hypothesized that this gene may be a new gene resulting from the evolution of the CCD4 subfamily, possibly due to annotation errors in the genomic data, which needs to be further verified. In the analysis of gene structure, we identified several genes with UTR gains and losses during the evolutionary process, which may be responsible for the diversification of gene functions ( X. Zhang et al., 2023 ). In addition, in terms of conserved structural domains, all 14 CrCCOs contained the RPE65 structural domain common to the CCO gene family. It further verified the accuracy of the identification results and indicated that all these members could cleave carotenoids."

              "To understand the biological processes in which members of the CCO gene family may be involved, we used the Plant CARE website to perform cis-acting element analyses of a region 2,000 bp upstream of the gene. The cis-acting element analysis revealed that a total of 345 cis-acting elements were identified, in addition to the TATA-box, CAAT-box, and some elements with unknown functions, which could be categorized into 62 abiotic and biotic stress-responsive elements (18 %), 113 phytohormone-responsive elements (32.8 %), and 170 plant growth and development-responsive elements (49.2 %) ( Fig. 5 ). The abiotic and biotic response elements were mainly environmental stress-related action elements, in which many cis-acting elements involved in low temperature and drought were found, and WUN motif elements were found only in CrCCD4a . The phytohormone response elements included methyl jasmonate-acting elements (CGTCA-motif and TGACG-motif), salicylic acid-acting elements (TCA-elements), gibberellin-acting elements (GARE-motif, P-box and TATC-box), abscisic acid-acting elements (ABREs) and growth hormone-acting elements (AuxRR-core and TGA-elements). Notably, the abscisic acid response element ABRE was found in the promoters of most of the CrCCOs , and at the same time, this element was the most abundant among the CrCCOs (47). In addition, among the plant growth and developmental response elements, the promoters of CrCCOs also contain a large number of light-responsive elements, Box 4 and G-boxes, which account for 53.6 % of the elements in this class; thus, members of the gene family should be able to respond positively to light-related responses, i.e., light can influence the effect of the gene on carotenoid content. These results suggest that the CrCCO family of genes may be associated with many transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that can play a role in the growth and development of Orah mandarin and the response to various environmental stresses and hormonal signals.",
              "Cis-acting element analysis revealed that CrCCO promoters contain many abiotic and biotic stress-related, phytohormone-responsive (MeJA, SA, GA, ABA, and IAA) and plant growth- and development-responsive elements. Many phytohormones not only regulate and influence many physiological processes in plants but also play crucial roles in plant responses to stresses, and ABA, a phytohormone present in plants, is involved in a wide range of processes involved in fruit ripening ( Xue et al., 2023 ). ABA-responsive elements are the most abundant phytohormone-responsive elements in the promoters of Cerasus humilis CCO genes, and phytohormones involved in the ABA response have been found in the promoter regions of all Sporisorium scitamineum CCO gene-responsive elements ( Su et al., 2021 ; Cheng et al., 2023 ). Consistent with this, the promoters of most CrCCOs identified in our study were predicted to contain the ABA-responsive element ABRE, and ABRE was the most abundant. Moreover, carotenoids serve as prerequisite substances for ABA synthesis, and NCED subfamily genes can regulate the degradation of carotenoids; therefore, we hypothesized that the upregulation of CCO gene expression could promote an increase in the ABA content in the flavedo, which not only accelerates the process of flavedo discoloration but also participates in plant resistance to unfavorable environmental stresses ( Xue et al., 2023 ; Xian et al., 2014 ). In addition, many abiotic and biotic stresses and plant growth and development response elements, such as ARE, LTR, MBS, TC-rich repeats, Box 4, and G-box, were also detected in CCO promoters. These results suggest that CrCCOs may play a role in flavedo color change and stress response in Orah mandarin."

              "RNA-Seq analysis was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the accumulation of CCOs in different colored flavedo tissues. Reads containing junctions and low-quality reads were removed, and 48.77 G of clean reads with Q30 values ranging from 94.11 % to 94.29 % were obtained after passing quality control. Among these clean reads, more than 92.04 % were successfully aligned to the reference genome, much greater than 70 %. These findings indicated that the RNA-Seq data were highly reliable and could be used for subsequent analysis. Correlation analysis was first performed on the six RNA-Seq samples, and a heatmap of the intersample correlation and the corresponding scatter plot were generated according to the quantitative values of the genes. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used as indices for assessing the relevance of the biological replicates ( Song et al., 2024 ). The results showed ( Fig. 6 A) that the Pearson correlation coefficients of the samples were all above 0.91, indicating that the stronger the correlation between the two replicate samples was, the more they could be used for subsequent gene screening. In this study, we used TPM=0.1 as the threshold for determining whether a gene is expressed or not, above which a gene is considered to be expressed. Fig. 6 B shows that a total of seven genes in the CrCCO gene family were expressed in the flavedo, four were upregulated, and three were downregulated in different colors of the flavedo; among these genes, the CrCCD4b1, CrCCD8b, and CrNCED5 genes were upregulated, and CrCCD4a was downregulated. It can be inferred that these factors may play a crucial role in the development of the flavedo and fruit of the Orah mandarin flavedo and fruit development and are particularly specific to fruit color and the coloring process. The RNA-seq data revealed that only seven (50 %) CrCCOs were expressed in the flavedo, of which CrCCD4b1, CrCCD8b, CrNCED5 , and CrCCD4a were DEGs, suggesting that these genes are closely related to the flavedo red color trait and are available for further analysis. Moreover, seven CrCCO ( CrCCD4b2, CrCCD4b3, CrCCD4C, CrCCD4d, CrCCD7 , and CrCCD8a ) genes were almost not expressed in the flavedo of the two different Orah mandarins. In addition, in combination with Priya's findings, it is hypothesized that the expression of the Orah mandarin CCO gene family has significant tissue expression specificity, which explains why some of the CCOs were not expressed in the flavedo ( Priya and Siva, 2014 ).",
              "To further elucidate the biological functions of the 14 CrCCO genes, based on the above RNA-seq data, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Fig. 7 A shows that the GO enrichment results of 14 CrCCO gene family members were annotated and classified into three categories: molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC). Among the enrichment results, we screened the GO terms with more than seven genes, totaling 15 terms, and we visualized them via the Chiplot platform ( https://www.chiplot.online/ ). The molecular function category included GO:0,003,824 (catalytic activity), GO:0,010,436 (carotenoid dioxygenase activity), GO:0,016,701 (oxidoreductase activity), and GO:0,051,213 (dioxygenase activity); the biological process category included GO:0,006,629 (lipid metabolic process), GO:0,006,720 (isoprenoid metabolic process), GO:0,006,721 (terpenoid metabolic process), GO:0,016,116 (carotenoid metabolic process), GO:0,016,119 (carotene metabolic process), GO:0,016,121 (carotene catabolic process), GO:0,071,704 (organic substance metabolic process), GO:0,120,252 (hydrocarbon metabolic process), and GO:1901,810 (beta-carotene metabolic process). The cellular component category included GO:0,005,737 (cytoplasm) and GO:0,009,507 (chloroplast). The enriched GO terms were mainly related to the synthesis and decomposition of carotenoids, the catalytic activities of some enzymes, and the metabolic processes and sites of carotenoid-related substances. There are five GO terms directly related to carotenoid metabolism, accounting for one-third of the total number of GO terms, and the number of genes enriched in each GO term is at least 50 % of the number of CrCCO members, which may be the main factor for the formation of yellow and red fruits. The above results indicate the crucial role of carotenoids in fruit coloration during fruit ripening in Orah mandarin.",
              "KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the formation of the two flavedo colors and their associated pathways ( Y. Wang et al., 2023 ). Fig. 7 B shows that in Orah mandarin peels of different colors, the carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906), metabolic pathways (ko01100), and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (ko01110) pathways were significantly enriched in the CCO gene family, with 12 (85.7 %) of the genes enriched in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is basically in line with previous studies ( Su et al., 2021 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that these pathways are closely related to the components and content of carotenoids, which further demonstrates that the CCO gene family is widely involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and can regulate the metabolism of related substances and the expression of genes in the plant, which in turn decreases the original ratio of pigments in the flavedo and ultimately affects the development of Orah mandarin fruits and flavedo color formation."

To investigate the pattern of variation in carotenoid composition and content in the peels of Orah mandarin fruits of different colors, we identified carotenoid metabolites in the samples via targeted metabolomic techniques on a UHPLC-MS platform. After quality assessment, a total of 15 carotenoid metabolites were identified from the peel samples, including α-carotene, γ-carotene, β-carotene, (E/Z)-phytoene, ε-carotene, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, apocarotenal, α-cryptoxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone and β-citraurin (Table S4). These carotenoids can be categorized into two main groups: carotenes (3.92 %) and lutein xanthophylls (96.08 %). By comparing the classification of carotenoid compounds, it was found that the total xanthophyll content was significantly greater in red peels than in yellow peels, and the total carotene content was almost unchanged. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the color difference was regulated by the composition and content of xanthophyll compounds.",

As shown in the figure, all of these samples have similar metabolite profiles, and yellow and red flavedo can be easily separated from them, which suggests that there is a significant difference in Orah mandarin metabolites between the two flavedo colors and that the biological replicates of each color can form a denser population. The metabolomic data of this sample were found to be biologically reproducible and reliable enough for subsequent qualitative and quantitative analysis. In this study, we used OPLS-DA to compare the carotenoid metabolites of different Orah mandarins ( Fig. 8 B). The results of OPLS-DA model validation showed that the R 2 Y and Q 2 values were greater than 0.9 ( p < 0.05), which indicated that these models were reliable and stable and were suitable for the present experiment. DAMs were also screened using VIP ≥ 1, p < 0.05, and fold change > 2 or < 0.5 as the criteria.",
              "The relative content of carotenoid pathways in Orah mandarin peels of different colors was analyzed by HCA thermograms, and the results showed that the peels were not uniform in color, the carotenoid compounds did not accumulate in the same pattern, and the six samples could be divided into two groups ( Fig. 8 C). As shown in the figure, the relative content of metabolites in yellow peels was distinctly different from that in red peels. The total carotenoids detected were 1010.1 μg/g and 1557 μg/g. Yellow peel was used as the control, and red peel was used as the treatment. Total carotenoids in the samples were upregulated by 54.1 % compared to those in the control group. The carotenoid composition and content significantly differed between the two colors of Orah mandarin. Based on the above criteria for DAM screening, we counted a total of five DAMs, namely, γ-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, apocarotenal, echinenone, and β-citraurin, among samples from each group, which all exhibited differentially upregulated metabolites. Notably, the highest fold changes in the expression of apocarotenal and β-citraurin were 8.6- and 18.1-fold, respectively, and these metabolites may be important determinants of Orah mandarin flavedo color formation. Therefore, we will focus on these DAMs in future studies.",
              "β-Citraurin has been detected in several citrus spp. ( C. clementina and C. sinensis ), and some Citrus varieties can reach 30 % of the total carotenoid content, which is a vital substance for the bright red color of citrus peels ( Luan et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2018 ; Yue et al., 2023 ). β-Citraurinene is a C30 carotenoid, consistent with the chemical formula of apocarotenal detected in the present study. Further inquiry revealed that β-citraurinene and apocarotenal are different names for the same substance, so apocarotenal was identified in the present study. β-Citraurin may be the crucial metabolite for the red color trait of Orah mandarin peel, which is in line with the results of previous studies ( M.J. Rodrigo et al., 2013 ; Zheng et al., 2021 , 2015 ). Moreover, an enzymatic degradation pathway or a nonenzymatic degradation pathway to reduce β-citraurin to apocarotenal may occur in the cells of Citrus spp. Therefore, when the ratio of the two metabolites changes, the total amount of C30 carotenoids in the peels does not change, which does not cause a change in color traits ( Zheng et al. 2019 )."

              "Correlation analysis of the expression levels of CrCCO genes and the metabolism levels of carotenoid metabolites was analyzed. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient to evaluate the relationship between CCO gene expressions and carotenoid metabolites, which was visualized as a correlation matrix based on Pearson's r-value. Fig. 9 A shows that 12 Orah mandarin CCOs were correlated with 13 carotenoid metabolites. Notably, there was a significant correlation between the gene expression levels of two of the CrCCO members ( CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5 ) and the levels of apocarotenal and β-citraurin detected in the samples, with R-values ranging from 0.81 to 0.84 ( p < 0.05), which was similar to the findings of Zhang et al. ( J. Zhang et al., 2023 ). In addition, the levels of CrCCD4a, CrNCED3, and the two DAMs mentioned above were negatively correlated but did not reach a significant level. A threshold of 0.05 for the p-value and 0.8 for the r-value was used as the screening criterion; some genes that did not meet these conditions were excluded, and the results were visualized as a correlation chord plot ( Fig. 9 B). As shown in the figure, the two genes, CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5, have many branches. However, many of the metabolite branches are connected to the gene, and it was also found that the correlation between these genes and apocarotenal and β-citraurin was significantly higher than that between the other genes and metabolites. It suggests that the two mentioned members of CrCCO s play crucial roles in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and may be jointly involved in the same substance synthesis and metabolism. Based on the results obtained from the screening conditions, we constructed a correlation network diagram ( Fig. 9 C) to visualize the connection between these CrCCOs and carotenoid metabolites. CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5 are located at the center of the whole correlation network, connecting multiple carotenoid metabolites and members of CrCCO , which are positively correlated with apocarotenal and β-citraurin and indirectly regulate the levels of these two DAMs through other metabolites. Based on the above analysis, we hypothesized that CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5 could positively regulate the metabolic levels of apocarotenal and β-citraurin in the flavedo, which would change the composition and content of carotenoids, thus causing the color of Orah mandarin fruits to change, showing a difference between yellow and red. Therefore, CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5 are the vital genes involved in this process.",
              "Notably, in earlier studies, the CsCCD4b gene was shown to be a candidate gene for the formation of the red trait in sweet orange ( C. sinensis ) peels ( Zheng et al., 2019 , 2015 ). According to our evolutionary tree, the gene most closely related to CsCCD4b was CrCCD4b1 , so it is hypothesized that this gene may also play a crucial role in regulating the polymorphism of peel color. In addition, we found that the sequence similarity of the two genes was as high as 90.41 %. Therefore, we performed a comparative analysis of these two genes, including their structure, conserved structural domains, conserved motifs, and cis-acting elements. The results revealed (Figure S5) that these genes contain RPE65 structural domains, their subcellular localization is also in the cytoplasm, the compositions and positions of conserved motifs and cis-acting elements are very similar, and CsCCD4b has only an extra UTR compared with CrCCD4b1 . In physicochemical properties (Table S5), only the theoretical pI is different ( CsCCD4b is a fundamental protein, while CrCCD4b1 is an acidic protein), and the other properties are almost identical. Combined with the gene structure analysis (Figure S5B), we hypothesize that this is because the CsCCD4b gene has small segments of the UTR at the ends of the gene, whereas CrCCD4b1 does not, which leads to few differences between the two genes in the above analysis. We also submitted these two genes to the CPBD database for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. The results showed that the GO enrichment of both was concentrated on the GO term, and the KEGG enrichment was in the same pathway (K09840), which included carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906), metabolic pathways (ko01100) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (ko01110). In addition, the structures of both genes were also predicted, and the 3D structures were found to be very similar (Figure S5E). This further confirmed that CrCCD4b1 also plays functions in controlling the formation of flavedo color."

Through the prediction of miRNA targeting sites, we identified a total of 39 miRNAs that regulate 13 (92.9 %) CrCCOs through an inhibition mechanism (Figure S3) and only seven miRNAs that target CrCCO genes through translation; the remaining miRNAs regulate CrCCO gene expression through cleavage. Among them, CrNCED5 had the greatest number of targeted miRNAs, reaching 8; for the average value, each gene could be regulated by three miRNAs. In addition, we screened the target miRNAs associated with CrCCD4b1 and constructed a miRNA interaction network ( Fig. 10 ). The same miRNA could interact with multiple CrCCO genes, such as miR477d-3p and miR12105–3p, connected to two genes at their ends. In this figure, CrCCD4b1, CrNCED3 , and CrNCED5 are vital nodes of the interaction network and interact through miR477d-3p (cleavage) and miR12105–3p (translation). The above results indicate that CrCCD4b1, CrNCED3, and CrNCED5 can target multiple miRNA sites, forming a miRNA-gene-mRNA-regulated network, which participates in the posttranscriptional expression regulation of CrCCOs and ultimately affects the content and composition of carotenoids, resulting in Orah mandarin fruits at maturity exhibiting yellow, red and other colors."

              "In this study, we analyzed four Orah mandarin CCO gene family members via qRT-PCR. The results (Figure S4) showed that the expression trends of the genes measured by qRT-PCR were generally consistent with those derived from RNA-seq analysis (R 2 =0.9922). These findings indicate that the RNA-seq data are reliable and can reflect the gene expression levels of Orah mandarin flavedo during the color change process.",
              "In this study, we identified the Orah mandarin CCO gene family and functionally characterized CrCCD4b1 , a gene related to the red peel trait, to reveal its role in carotenoid biosynthesis and Orah mandarin peel color change. Based on the results of this study, we proposed a specific regulatory model to analyze the CCO gene-mediated carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, which alters the color traits of Orah mandarin flavedo ( Fig. 11 ). Orah mandarin will change the expression of CrCCD4b1 after its flavedo senses the light difference under different light conditions. When the light becomes weaker, the expression of CrCCD4b1 increases and promotes the synthesis of apocarotenal and β-citraurin, thus increasing the content of red carotenoids in the flavedo. CrNCED5 is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes ABA biosynthesis, and it uses epoxy carotenoids as substrates to accumulate large amounts of ABA ( Sun et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). These ABAs can directly bind the promoters of carotenoid genes by stimulating regulatory modules, activating their expression, and promoting the accumulation of associated carotenoids. Thus, CrNCED5 can be considered a cofactor of CrCCD4b1 , which mediates an integrated regulatory network of C30 carotenoid metabolism by synthesizing ABA. With the gradual accumulation of apocarotenal and β-citraurin, the content of C30 carotenoids in the flavedo increased, thus affecting the composition and content of carotenoids and ultimately causing the flavedo to change from yellow to red. In summary, this study demonstrated that CrCCD4b1 , among the CrCCO gene family members, can directly and positively regulate the biosynthesis of C30 carotenoids (apocarotenal and β-citraurin) in the flavedo of Orah mandarin fruit and can serve as a vital candidate gene for the red color trait in the flavedo of Orah mandarin. However, the receptors in the flavedo cells that sense light changes and the signaling process after the cells sense the changes are not clear at present, which will be the focus of our future research."

The expression level of CrCCD4b1 was shown to affect flavedo color. It was also found that the color index and total carotenoid content of the red flavedo of Orah mandarin were greater than those of yellow Orah mandarin and that apocarotenal and β-citraurin were the prime metabolites in the flavedo that controlled the red flavedo traits. In addition, a model for C30 carotenoid (apocarotenal, β-citraurin) biosynthesis regulation in the flavedo of Orah mandarin by CrCCD4b1 is proposed. This study revealed a mechanism by which the CrCCO gene family regulates carotenoid biosynthesis, providing a theoretical basis for improving the color of the Orah mandarin peel."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Citrus is one of the world's four main fruits. In 2022, China had a citrus planting area of more than three million hectares, an output of more than 60 million tons, and a peel color as a crucial indicator of the quality of the consumer's most intuitive sensory experience, which directly determines the economic benefits of the fruit ( M.J. Rodrigo et al., 2013 ; Sun et al., 2023 ). The peels of mature citrus fruits are sometimes red and sometimes yellow or orange, which affects the market popularity of the fruits. In the production process, researchers have found significant differences in fruit appearance and coloration between different fruiting parts of trees, in which light conditions may be the main influencing factor ( Jia et al., 2021 ). The development of citrus fruit color is physiologically related to chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin metabolism, of which the content and composition of carotenoids are the main factors affecting coloration in most citrus ( Huang et al., 2022 ). Carotenoids are formed with 40 carbon atoms as the fundamental skeleton and isoprene as the basic unit connected by multiple conjugated double bonds, and the number of conjugated double bonds is closely related to the color of carotenoids ( Sun et al., 2022 ). Carotenoid cleavage oxygenase ( CCO ) genes are widely involved in fruit color regulation ( Ni et al., 2023 ). CCOs are vital enzyme-encoding genes in the carotenoid degradation process that can oxidatively cleave carotenoids at different sites, thereby generating different carotenoid metabolites, which is one of the prime pathways of carotenoid degradation in organisms ( González-Verdejo et al., 2015 ; Lado et al., 2016 ). It causes changes in the carotenoids in the peel, which in turn affects the appearance and color of citrus fruits. CCO genes in higher plants are a relatively small gene family, and a total of nine members of the CCO gene family were identified in the Arabidopsis genome; these genes can be further divided into two subfamilies, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) and 9-cis-epoxy carotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs), based on the presence or absence of epoxidation of their catalytic substrates, including four subfamilies of CCDs (CCD1, CCD4, CCD7 and CCD8) and one subfamily of NCEDs (NCED2, NCED3, NCED5, NCED6 and NCED9) ( Wei et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). Based on the Arabidopsis CCO gene family, homologs found in other plants have since been named based on the homology of the gene to the Arabidopsis CCO genes. The CCO gene family is a class of nonheme iron oxidases whose catalytic activity requires the assistance of Fe 2+ to bind four histidines to accomplish oxidative cleavage ( Khadka et al., 2019 ; Sui et al., 2015 ). These members of the CCO family have different substrate specificities for carotenoids and differ in the double-bond site of oxidative cleavage, which also gives rise to different cleavage products. CCD1 is mainly associated with the formation of aroma substances and can produce β-ionone, β-cyclocitral, geranylacetone, pseudoionone, and other aroma substances through the cleavage of cyclic and chain carotenoids ( Cheng et al., 2023 ; Gong et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). CCD4 can directly contact C40 carotenoid substrates to produce plant colors and aromatic compounds by cleaving their double bonds at different positions ( Rubio-Moraga et al., 2014 ). It was found that CCD4b1 of Citrus sinensis and Citrus clementina oxidized the 7′−8′ or 7,8 double bonds of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, and the products were C30 carotenoids (β-citraurin and β-citraurinene) specific to citrus, which caused the peel to exhibit a red color; moreover, the insertion of the MITE transposon in the CCD4b promoter sequence was highly positively correlated with high expression of CCD4b and the red peel trait. In addition, the presence of the MITE transposon in the CCD4b promoter sequence was strongly positively correlated with the high expression of CCD4b and the red peel trait. The insertion of this fragment caused an accumulation of C30 carotenoids, which led to the formation of the red peel trait in citrus plants ( M.J. Rodrigo et al., 2013 ; Zheng et al., 2019 , 2015 ). CCD7 and CCD8 can cleave carotenoids to produce strigolactones, while NCEDs are involved mainly in abscisic acid synthesis ( Seto et al., 2014 ; Xian et al., 2014 ). The above results indicate that the simultaneous presence of multiple CCO genes in plants, which play their respective functions in different plant tissues and jointly regulate plant carotenoid metabolism, has crucial biological functions in plant growth and development, adversity stress, and color formation and has therefore been doubly attracting the attention of researchers ( Varghese et al., 2021 ). Orah mandarin ( Citrus reticulata Blanco) is one of the late-maturing citrus varieties with the largest area in China; this variety has excellent characteristics, such as better tree strength, beautiful fruit appearance, early fruit set and high yield, excellent internal quality, late maturity, and high sugar content. Planting Orah mandarin has developed rapidly in recent years ( Li et al., 2022 ). The red color of the Orah mandarin has always been popular among consumers. However, in the actual production process, most of the ripe Orah mandarin peels in this region are yellow instead of the inherent red color, which affects the market popularity of the fruit. Currently, the CCO gene family is involved in the development of fruit color, but genome-wide identification of Orah mandarin CCOs has not been reported ( Ding et al., 2023 ). Members of the CCD4 subfamily may be involved in regulating the formation of Orah mandarin peel color. However, the effect of the expression of this gene in the peel on the variation in peel color is not known. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and study the CrCCO gene family involved in the genesis of Orah mandarin fruit color and the vital genes that regulate red skin formation. In this study, we identified the Orah mandarin CCO gene family using bioinformatics methods, and we analyzed its gene structure, conserved motifs, phylogeny, cis-regulatory elements, and GO and KEGG functional annotations, which provided a preliminary understanding of the fundamental functions and characteristics of CCO genes. In addition, the expression levels of CCO genes and carotenoid metabolites were analyzed by combining physiology, transcriptome sequencing technology, and carotenoid-targeted metabolism technology to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of fruit color changes in Orah mandarin. This study will reveal the regulatory mechanisms of metabolites during the color change of Orah mandarin fruits, which will help to promote our understanding of carotenoid metabolism in citrus fruits. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant material and treatments This experiment was carried out in 2022 at the planting base of Xinping Longcheng Fruit Development Co., Ltd., in Yunnan Province, China (24 ° 15′26.7″N, 101 ° 27′0.6″E, altitude 1245 m), and the test variety was Huayao Orah mandarin. We selected 7-year-old Orah mandarin plants with uniform growth and medium fruiting capacity, a rootstock of Ziyang Xiangcheng ( Citrus junos Sieb.), a plant spacing of 2 × 4 m, and management by conventional cultivation measures. Sampling was carried out at commercial maturity (total soluble solids ≥ 12, total acid ≤ 1.1), and three fruits of different colors each from the east, south, west, north, and central directions of the tree were collected from each plant totaling 30 fruits, which were packed in black bags and transported to the laboratory, and three biological replicates were set up. Orah mandarin fruits free from mechanical damage and disease were sterilized using a sodium hypochlorite solution (4 % volume), rinsed several times in sterile water, and dried naturally. Based on the color difference, these fruits were divided into two groups, yellow and red, and the 2–3 mm thick flavedo was collected using a scalpel, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for backup. The color difference values were determined using a CR20 colorimeter (Hangzhou Color Spectrum Technology Co., Ltd), and four points were selected on the equatorial plane of Orah mandarin fruits to measure the color difference values. The L* value (brightness value), a* value (red‒greenness value), b* value (yellow‒blueness value), H ° (hue angle), and CI (color index) were recorded, where H° = arctan (b* / a*), and CI = 1000 × a * / (L* × b *) and the average value was taken for analysis. The total carotenoid content was detected using the BC4330 plant carotenoid content assay kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). One hundred milligrams of fresh fruit peels were accurately weighed, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then ground into powder using a fully automated sample freezer grinder. Then, the pigment components were fully extracted by adding an 80 % acetone solution. The filtrate was transferred to a 25 mL brown volumetric flask, and the volume was adjusted to 10 mL with an acetone solution. The above solution was added to a cuvette, and the absorbance of the extracted solution was measured at 440 nm with the acetone solution as a reference to calculate the total carotenoid content according to the formula. The total carotenoid content ( μ g / g · FW ) = 0.04 × A 440 × F ÷ W ( F : dilution factor ; W : sample weight ) . 2.2 Identification of the CCO gene family in the Orah mandarin Genomic data, protein sequences, and annotation files for Orah mandarin were downloaded from the Citrus Pan-genome to Breeding Database ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/ ), and protein sequence information for CCOs in Arabidopsis was obtained from TAIR ( https://www.arabidopsis.org/ ) ( Liu et al., 2022 ). The Orah mandarin CCO gene family was identified in two steps. First, based on AtCCO protein sequences, the Orah mandarin genome was searched for potential CrCCO gene family using Blast-2.13.0 software; second, the Pfam database ( http://pfam-legacy.xfam.org/ ) was searched, the CCO gene family-specific RPE65 (PF03055) structural domain sequence was downloaded, and a crypto-Marxian model was constructed using HMMER-3.0 software to search for sequences containing the RPE65 structural domain among potential CrCCOs . Finally, the results obtained above were analyzed for structural domains using the online tool NCBI-CDD ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/bwrpsb/bwrpsb.cgi/ ) to remove sequences that did not contain the RPE65 structural domain, and the members of the CrCCO gene family were finally identified. The physicochemical properties, such as the number of amino acids, molecular weight, theoretical pI, and grand average hydropathicity, of the proteins encoded by the CrCCO gene family were predicted using the ExPASy website ( https://web.expasy.org/ ). In addition, subcellular localization information of CrCCO proteins was predicted using the Plant-mPLoc online program ( http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/plant-multi/ ) ( Chou and Shen, 2010 ). 2.3 Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis We used Clustal Omega ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo ) to perform multiple sequence alignments and calculate sequence similarity to analyze the homology between the Orah mandarin CCO gene family, and based on sequence similarity, we used TBtools to construct a correlation heatmap between family members ( Chen et al., 2023 ). Several plants with distinctive color changes during the fruit development stage were selected to better elucidate the evolutionary relationship between Orah mandarin and other plant CCO gene family members. Using MAFFT (v.7.505), we compared the sequences of CrCCOs with those of Arabidopsis thaliana, Citrus clementina, Cucurbita pepo, Malus domestica, Pyrus bretschneideri, Solanum Lycopersicum and Citrus sinensis CCO sequences. Phylogenetic trees (bootstrap value of 1000 replications) were constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method based on the alignment results using iqtree (v.1.6.12), and the landscaping tool used was the ChiPlot website ( https://www.chiplot.online/ ). 2.4 Gene structure, conserved structural domain, and conserved motif analysis Phylogenetic tree of CrCCOs constructed using MEGA 7.0 based on the ML method. The gene structure information of CrCCOs was obtained from the GFF3 file of the Orah mandarin genome. The identification of conserved structural domains can be retrieved through the NCBI CD-search website ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi/ ) and the Pfam website ( http://pfam-legacy.xfam.org/ ). The conserved motifs of CrCCOs were retrieved using the MEME tool ( https://meme-suite.org/meme/ ), and the maximum number of conserved motifs retrieved was 10, with other default parameters. Finally, the results were visualized and edited using CFVisual software ( Chen et al., 2022 ). 2.5 Cis-acting elements of promoters To identify cis-acting elements in the CrCCO genes, a 2000 bp sequence upstream of the CDS was extracted from the Orah mandarin genome as the promoter region of the CrCCO genes. Cis-acting elements in the promoter region were predicted using Plant Care ( https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ ) and visualized by TBtools after counting ( Chen et al., 2023 ). 2.6 Expression profiling and functional annotation of the CCO gene family To study the causes of the differences in the color of Orah mandarin peel and to explore the vital genes that regulate the development of red color, this study used fruits of different colors from the Orah mandarin plant as the test material. Then, libraries were constructed after RNA extraction and quality control, and a second-generation high-throughput sequencing platform was used for sequencing, after which RNA-Seq data on the different colors of Orah mandarin fruit peel were obtained. To avoid problems such as low-quality sequences and splice contamination in the transcriptome data, we performed data quality control (QC) on the raw data to ensure all the reads had a Q value greater than 30. After quality control, the clean reads obtained from filtering were compared to a reference sequence ( Citrus reticulata v1.0) to localize them to the genome. At the end of the comparison, the distribution of reads on the reference sequence and the coverage were counted to determine whether the comparison results passed the second QC. If passed, a transcript per million (TPM) calculation was performed to measure the gene expression levels. Heatmaps of CCO gene family expression profiles were created based on TPM values using TBtools software. In this study, we used a fold change ≥ 1.5 and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 as the screening criteria, and genes that met these criteria were defined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The original RNA-Seq data were uploaded to the NCBI database for storage, and the project number is PRJNA1103366. Gene Ontology (GO, https://geneontology.org/ ) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ) enrichment analysis can be used for CrCCO gene family function annotation and classification ( Zhu et al., 2024 ). CrCCO gene family protein sequences were extracted from the protein sequence files for the whole genome of Orah mandarin, and these protein sequences were uploaded to the EggNOG-MAPPER database ( http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/ ) for gene function annotation. The annotation results were enriched using TBtools. Finally, it was manipulated for visualization and beautification through the online tool ChiPlot ( https://www.chiplot.online/ ). 2.7 RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis To verify the accuracy of the RNA-Seq data, based on the fold change values, we selected four CrCCO genes, namely, CrCCD4a, CrCCD4b1, CrCCD8b, and CrNCED5 . Total RNA was extracted from all samples using the OminiPlant RNA Kit (Kangwei Century) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using MonScript™ RTIII All-in-One Mix with dsDNase (Monad) and a QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN), and qRT-PCR was performed according to previously reported procedures ( Yu et al., 2022 ). CrActin (MSYJ123410) was selected as the internal reference gene to normalize the data, three biological replicates were used for each gene, and the relative expression of the genes was calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCt method ( Li et al., 2024a, 2024b ). Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer 5.0, and the sequences of all primer pairs are listed in Table S1. 2.8 Carotenoid-targeted metabolomic analysis The yellow and red Orah mandarin flavedo was milled, extracted, and analyzed by Wuhan Meteville Biotechnology Co., Ltd. ( https://www.metware.cn/ ). The cryopreserved samples were removed and ground (30 Hz, 1 min) to powder form using a ball mill. A 50 mg ground sample was weighed and extracted with 0.5 mL of hexane/acetone/ethanol mixture (1:1:1, v/v/v) containing 0.01 % BHT (g/mL). After vortexing for 20 mins at room temperature, the extract was centrifuged for 5 mins at 12,000 r/min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the extraction was repeated once before centrifugation to combine the supernatants. The obtained extract was concentrated, reconstituted with 100 μL of dichloromethane, passed through a 0.22 μm filter membrane, and stored in a brown injection bottle for LC-MS/MS analysis. The cryofreeze-dried samples were first ground to extract the solution to be measured for subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Analyst 1.6.3 and MultiQuant 3.0.3 software were used to analyze the mass spectrometry data, and a database constructed based on the retention time (min) and ion flow intensity (cps) information of the standards was used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze all the samples (Table S4). The peak areas of all the detected chromatographic peaks of the samples were substituted into the linear equation of the standard curve for calculation, and the content data of the substances in the samples were finally obtained (Table S4). The filtered and quality-controlled data were submitted to the MetWare Cloud platform ( https://cloud.metware.cn/ ) for principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal projections to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) ( Qian et al., 2023 ). OPLS-DA is a multivariate statistical analysis method for supervised pattern recognition that can plot OPLS-DA scores and provide variable importance in the projection (VIP) of OPLS-DA models. Differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were screened using VIP ≥ 1, p < 0.05, and fold change ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5 as criteria ( Li et al., 2023 ). 2.9 Analysis of correlation coefficients We performed a correlation analysis based on the expression of 14 CrCCO genes and the content of 15 carotenoid metabolites, and we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients of the genes and metabolites by using the cor function in the R package to evaluate the relationship between the expression of the CCO genes and the carotenoid content of the Orah mandarin fruits. The results are presented as a clustered heatmap, and the correlation coefficients were determined by a p-value of 0.05 and an r-value of 0.8 for the screening conditions ( J. Zhang et al., 2023 ). 2.10 MicroRNA target site prediction To identify microRNAs (miRNAs) for members of the CrCCO gene family, we used the method of Yin et al. to predict the interactions between published Orah mandarin miRNAs and CCO genes ( Yin et al., 2023 ). First, all Orah mandarin miRNA sequences were downloaded from the miRBase database ( https://www.mirbase.org/ ). Second, the miRNA sequences and coding sequences (CDSs) of CrCCOs were submitted to the psRNATarget online website ( https://www.zhaolab.org/psRNATarget/ ) to analyze the potential targeting relationships of miRNAs with Orah mandarin CCO genes. Finally, the predictions were visualized using the ggalluvia package in R and Cytoscape software ( M. Wang et al., 2023 ). 2.11 Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using SPSS 25 software, and graphs were generated using Excel and GraphPad Prism 6.0. All the data analyses were performed using at least three independent biological replicates. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least significant difference (LSD) methods were used to test for statistical significance between treatments, with 95 % confidence intervals ( P < 0.05) considered to indicate statistical significance. Finally, the model was plotted using FigDraw 2.0. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phenotypic and pigment content analysis of Orah mandarin flavedo In this study, we used the parameters of the CIE L*a*b* color space, including the brightness index (L*), red saturation index (a*), yellow saturation index (b*), hue angle (H ° ), and color index (CI), to characterize the color variation of the Orah mandarin flavedo. Fig. 1 revealed that compared with Orah mandarin, which has a yellow flavedo, the red Orah mandarin had greater a* and CI values, while L*, b*, and H ° all exhibited decreasing trends. All the values except b* were significantly different, suggesting that the various colors of Orah mandarin were primarily determined by a* and CI, and the greater the value was, the deeper reddish the color of the flavedo was. In addition, we examined the content of total carotenoids in the flavedo and performed a correlation analysis between a* and CI and the total carotenoid content. Figure S1 revealed a strong positive correlation (R 2 = 0.997, R 2 = 0.9523) between the color parameter (a*, CI) and the total carotenoid content of Orah mandarin fruits during ripening. These findings suggest a strong relationship between the total carotenoid content and the color of Orah mandarin flavedo. Light is an important environmental factor that affects the appearance and color of fruits, and we selected yellow and red Orah mandarins under different light conditions and measured the color differences and total carotenoid contents of their flavedo. In this study, the peel color of the Orah mandarin was positively correlated with a* and CI; that is, the a* and CI of the shaded red Orah mandarin were much greater than those of the light-sufficient yellow Orah mandarin, and both these values were significant. The total carotenoid content of yellow Orah mandarin was also significantly lower than that of red Orah mandarin, and correlation analysis also revealed that a*, CI and total carotenoid content were positively correlated (R 2 > 0.95). Moreover, the greater the values of a*, CI and total carotenoid content of Orah mandarin are, the darker and redder the color of its peel is, and vice versa. 3.2 Identification, physicochemical properties, and classification of the CrCCO gene family To identify genes associated with CrCCOs , a total of 14 CrCCO gene family members with typical RPE65 structural domains were ultimately obtained from the Orah mandarin genome, as verified by local BLAST, HMMER searches, and NCBI-CCD structural domain analysis (Table S2). These genes were named according to the homologous genes in Arabidopsis, and those without homologous genes were named CrCCD-like ( Fig. 2 ). The number of amino acids in the CrCCO gene family members ranged from 108 (CrCCD4b3) to 658 (CrCCD4a), with a mean of 497 aa. The molecular weights ranged from 12.20 kDa (CrCCD4b3) to 72.85 kDa (CrCCD4a), with a mean of 55.57 kDa. The theoretical pI ranged from 5.12 (CrCCD4b3) to 8.25 (CrCCD4C), where all CrCCOs except CrCCD4C and CrNCED6 had pIs less than seven and were presumed to be acidic proteins. Eight CrCCOs were predicted to be stable proteins with instability indices less than 40. The aliphatic indexes ranged from 77.39 (CrNCED3) to 87.61 (CrCCD4d), averaging 81.33. The average hydropathicity for all genes was less than 0, ranging from −0.394 to −0.077, suggesting that members of the CrCCO gene family are hydrophilic proteins. Subcellular localization predictions indicate that most CrCCOs may function in the chloroplast and cytoplasm (Table S2). Among them, members of the CCD1, CCD7, and CCD-like subfamilies are localized only in the cytoplasm. The Orah mandarin CCO gene family was divided into six subfamilies based on sequence similarity to homologous Arabidopsis genes: CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, NCED, and CCD-like. The CCD4 subfamily contained the greatest number of genes, containing six genes and accounting for 42.86 % of the total CCOs . In contrast, none of the other subfamilies had more than three members, and three of them, CCD1, CCD7, and CCD-like, contained only one gene, accounting for 7.14 %. In this study, a total of 14 CCOs were identified in the Orah mandarin genome, which is comparable to those of A. thaliana (9), C. clementina (14), C. sinensis (14), C. pepo (13), M. domestica (21), P. bretschneideri (22), and S. Lycopersicum (7), which were all found to have 14 members of the CCO gene family in Orah mandarin, suggesting that the number of this family changes more slowly in Orah mandarin, probably because the reproductive isolation of Orah mandarin fruits is weaker and gene exchange and expansion are too frequent. This finding also suggested that Orah mandarin has evolved in a relatively similar manner to several other species and that the same CCO genes likely perform the same functions in Citrus spp. ( Huang et al., 2023 ). It was also found that the number of members of nonwoody plants (herbs and vines) was lower than that of woody plants, while the number of CCOs in fruit trees of the Rosaceae family was much greater than that of Citrus spp. We also found that the number of the CCO gene family did not correlate with the genome size but might be related to the direction and degree of evolution of the species. In addition, information on the basic physicochemical properties and subcellular localization of CrCCO genes was provided. 3.3 Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis of the Orah mandarin CCO gene family To analyze the homology between members of the CrCCO gene family, we used ClustalW and found that protein sequences within the same subfamily had high similarity ( Fig. 3 A). For example, CCD4b1, CCD4b2, and CCD4b3 have a high degree of similarity, up to 90 %. Multiple sequence alignment analyses revealed that all CrCCOs contained four conserved histidine residues and three conserved glutamic acid residues (Figure S2). To further explore the phylogenetic relationships of the CCO gene family in Orah mandarin, the sequences of the 14 CrCCOs identified in the Orah mandarin genome as described above, as well as the sequences of AtCCO, CcCCO, CpCCO, MdCCO, PbCCO, SlCCO , and CsCCO , were used to construct a phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 3 B). Based on the topology of the phylogenetic tree, the CrCCO gene family was classified into six subfamilies, CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, NCED, and CCD-like, which is consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses of CCOs in other plants. Interestingly, no AtCCO members were found in the CCD-like subfamily, suggesting that this subfamily may only replicate and expand in certain species. Moreover, more CrCCOs are on the same branch as CcCCOs in CrCCOs than in other species, such as C. sinensis , which is hypothesized to be more closely related. The Orah mandarin CCO gene family can be classified into six subfamilies, of which CCD4 is the largest subfamily, whereas CCD1, CCD7, and CCD8, NCED, and CCD-like also contain multiple genes but with some differences in number, which is consistent with the findings of other species. Orah mandarin, C. sinensis, and C. clementina are citrus species, while the CCO gene family all have 14 members but are present in different numbers in specific subfamilies. For example, CCD4 is the largest subfamily, and both C. sinensis and C. clementina have five members, while Orah mandarin has six members; therefore, it is speculated that Orah mandarin may have increased the number of gene members in the CCD4 subfamily through evolution, which means that some of the CCO genes in the subgroup may have new functions. Combining the differences in the intrinsic colors of Orah mandarin and the function of the CCO gene, we hypothesized that the change in the color of the Orah mandarin peel was due to the expression of these CCO genes regulating the change in carotenoid content. Genes in the same subfamily in the evolutionary tree may have proteins with related biological properties and perform the same function ( Yang et al., 2024 ). Thus, if two genes are in the same subfamily, we can infer the function of the unknown gene from the gene with a known function. Currently, functional studies of C. sinensis CCO genes are relatively abundant, so homology mining and analysis of CrCCOs and CsCCOs have been the focus of research, and we can speculate on the function of one of the genes based on the remoteness of the evolutionary relationship. 3.4 Gene structure, conserved structural domains, and conserved motifs of CrCCO To understand the structural and functional characteristics of the CrCCO gene family, the gene structures, conserved structural domains, and conserved motifs of all CCO genes in the Orah mandarin were analyzed. First, using 14 CCOs from Orah mandarin, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to reveal the evolutionary relationships among different members of the CCO gene family ( Fig. 4 A). According to its structure, it can be categorized into six subfamilies (among which the NCED subfamily can be further subdivided into three families), and this topology is similar to the structure of the phylogenetic tree constructed for the eight species mentioned above ( Fig. 3 B). Gene structure analysis revealed that the exon and intron structures of genes in the same branch were more similar, and the number of exons and introns differed significantly from branch to branch ( Fig. 4 C). The gene structures of CrCCO family members are diverse, suggesting having different functions in Orah mandarin growth and development. Conserved structural domain analysis revealed that all CrCCO genes contain an RPE65 structural domain ( Fig. 4 C). In the conserved motif analysis, ten different motifs with 21–41 amino acid residues were retrieved from the Orah mandarin CCO gene family using the MEME tool, with each CCO gene containing at least one conserved motif ( Fig. 4 B). Notably, to obtain a better picture of motif composition among the different groups (CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, NCED3, NCED5, NCED6, and CCD-like), we counted the number of motifs contained in each subfamily member. The results revealed significant differences in motif composition and number among the different groups. Notably, 92.9 % of all CrCCO proteins contained Motif1 and Motif2, indicating that these two motifs were the most common among the various family members and suggesting playing crucial roles in some biological functions. However, combining the results of the phylogenetic tree and motif analysis, we found that motif composition and number were not always highly conserved across subfamilies. For example, the CCD8 subfamily has only one less Motif4 than the CCD-like subfamily; thus, it is hypothesized that the CCD-like subfamily may have arisen from mutations in the CCD8 subfamily. In addition, among all CrCCO gene family members, all CCOs had 5–10 motifs, except for one CCO member, which contained only three motifs. These results suggest that the evolutionarily closely related CrCCO genes have similar motif compositions. Based on phylogenetic analyses of the gene structures, conserved structural domains, and conserved motifs of 14 CrCCOs, it was found that CrCCOs of the same subfamily have similar gene structures and motif compositions, and there are significant differences between different subfamilies, which further validates the categorization and phylogeny of CCOs . Most CrCCOs contain Motif1 and Motif2. Hence, these genes may share some of the same functions, but at the same time, there are many different Motifs, which may account for functional divergence during evolution. Notably, one of the six members of the CCD4 subfamily contains only Motif9, Motif6, and Motif1, significantly different from the other members in motif composition and number. In addition, in combination with the phenomenon that all the other citrus fruit trees in the CCD4 subfamily have only five members, it is hypothesized that this gene may be a new gene resulting from the evolution of the CCD4 subfamily, possibly due to annotation errors in the genomic data, which needs to be further verified. In the analysis of gene structure, we identified several genes with UTR gains and losses during the evolutionary process, which may be responsible for the diversification of gene functions ( X. Zhang et al., 2023 ). In addition, in terms of conserved structural domains, all 14 CrCCOs contained the RPE65 structural domain common to the CCO gene family. It further verified the accuracy of the identification results and indicated that all these members could cleave carotenoids. 3.5 Cis-acting element analysis of the promoter sequence of the CrCCO genes To understand the biological processes in which members of the CCO gene family may be involved, we used the Plant CARE website to perform cis-acting element analyses of a region 2,000 bp upstream of the gene. The cis-acting element analysis revealed that a total of 345 cis-acting elements were identified, in addition to the TATA-box, CAAT-box, and some elements with unknown functions, which could be categorized into 62 abiotic and biotic stress-responsive elements (18 %), 113 phytohormone-responsive elements (32.8 %), and 170 plant growth and development-responsive elements (49.2 %) ( Fig. 5 ). The abiotic and biotic response elements were mainly environmental stress-related action elements, in which many cis-acting elements involved in low temperature and drought were found, and WUN motif elements were found only in CrCCD4a . The phytohormone response elements included methyl jasmonate-acting elements (CGTCA-motif and TGACG-motif), salicylic acid-acting elements (TCA-elements), gibberellin-acting elements (GARE-motif, P-box and TATC-box), abscisic acid-acting elements (ABREs) and growth hormone-acting elements (AuxRR-core and TGA-elements). Notably, the abscisic acid response element ABRE was found in the promoters of most of the CrCCOs , and at the same time, this element was the most abundant among the CrCCOs (47). In addition, among the plant growth and developmental response elements, the promoters of CrCCOs also contain a large number of light-responsive elements, Box 4 and G-boxes, which account for 53.6 % of the elements in this class; thus, members of the gene family should be able to respond positively to light-related responses, i.e., light can influence the effect of the gene on carotenoid content. These results suggest that the CrCCO family of genes may be associated with many transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that can play a role in the growth and development of Orah mandarin and the response to various environmental stresses and hormonal signals. Cis-acting element analysis revealed that CrCCO promoters contain many abiotic and biotic stress-related, phytohormone-responsive (MeJA, SA, GA, ABA, and IAA) and plant growth- and development-responsive elements. Many phytohormones not only regulate and influence many physiological processes in plants but also play crucial roles in plant responses to stresses, and ABA, a phytohormone present in plants, is involved in a wide range of processes involved in fruit ripening ( Xue et al., 2023 ). ABA-responsive elements are the most abundant phytohormone-responsive elements in the promoters of Cerasus humilis CCO genes, and phytohormones involved in the ABA response have been found in the promoter regions of all Sporisorium scitamineum CCO gene-responsive elements ( Su et al., 2021 ; Cheng et al., 2023 ). Consistent with this, the promoters of most CrCCOs identified in our study were predicted to contain the ABA-responsive element ABRE, and ABRE was the most abundant. Moreover, carotenoids serve as prerequisite substances for ABA synthesis, and NCED subfamily genes can regulate the degradation of carotenoids; therefore, we hypothesized that the upregulation of CCO gene expression could promote an increase in the ABA content in the flavedo, which not only accelerates the process of flavedo discoloration but also participates in plant resistance to unfavorable environmental stresses ( Xue et al., 2023 ; Xian et al., 2014 ). In addition, many abiotic and biotic stresses and plant growth and development response elements, such as ARE, LTR, MBS, TC-rich repeats, Box 4, and G-box, were also detected in CCO promoters. These results suggest that CrCCOs may play a role in flavedo color change and stress response in Orah mandarin. 3.6 Functional annotation and classification of CrCCOs RNA-Seq analysis was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the accumulation of CCOs in different colored flavedo tissues. Reads containing junctions and low-quality reads were removed, and 48.77 G of clean reads with Q30 values ranging from 94.11 % to 94.29 % were obtained after passing quality control. Among these clean reads, more than 92.04 % were successfully aligned to the reference genome, much greater than 70 %. These findings indicated that the RNA-Seq data were highly reliable and could be used for subsequent analysis. Correlation analysis was first performed on the six RNA-Seq samples, and a heatmap of the intersample correlation and the corresponding scatter plot were generated according to the quantitative values of the genes. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used as indices for assessing the relevance of the biological replicates ( Song et al., 2024 ). The results showed ( Fig. 6 A) that the Pearson correlation coefficients of the samples were all above 0.91, indicating that the stronger the correlation between the two replicate samples was, the more they could be used for subsequent gene screening. In this study, we used TPM=0.1 as the threshold for determining whether a gene is expressed or not, above which a gene is considered to be expressed. Fig. 6 B shows that a total of seven genes in the CrCCO gene family were expressed in the flavedo, four were upregulated, and three were downregulated in different colors of the flavedo; among these genes, the CrCCD4b1, CrCCD8b, and CrNCED5 genes were upregulated, and CrCCD4a was downregulated. It can be inferred that these factors may play a crucial role in the development of the flavedo and fruit of the Orah mandarin flavedo and fruit development and are particularly specific to fruit color and the coloring process. The RNA-seq data revealed that only seven (50 %) CrCCOs were expressed in the flavedo, of which CrCCD4b1, CrCCD8b, CrNCED5 , and CrCCD4a were DEGs, suggesting that these genes are closely related to the flavedo red color trait and are available for further analysis. Moreover, seven CrCCO ( CrCCD4b2, CrCCD4b3, CrCCD4C, CrCCD4d, CrCCD7 , and CrCCD8a ) genes were almost not expressed in the flavedo of the two different Orah mandarins. In addition, in combination with Priya's findings, it is hypothesized that the expression of the Orah mandarin CCO gene family has significant tissue expression specificity, which explains why some of the CCOs were not expressed in the flavedo ( Priya and Siva, 2014 ). To further elucidate the biological functions of the 14 CrCCO genes, based on the above RNA-seq data, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Fig. 7 A shows that the GO enrichment results of 14 CrCCO gene family members were annotated and classified into three categories: molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC). Among the enrichment results, we screened the GO terms with more than seven genes, totaling 15 terms, and we visualized them via the Chiplot platform ( https://www.chiplot.online/ ). The molecular function category included GO:0,003,824 (catalytic activity), GO:0,010,436 (carotenoid dioxygenase activity), GO:0,016,701 (oxidoreductase activity), and GO:0,051,213 (dioxygenase activity); the biological process category included GO:0,006,629 (lipid metabolic process), GO:0,006,720 (isoprenoid metabolic process), GO:0,006,721 (terpenoid metabolic process), GO:0,016,116 (carotenoid metabolic process), GO:0,016,119 (carotene metabolic process), GO:0,016,121 (carotene catabolic process), GO:0,071,704 (organic substance metabolic process), GO:0,120,252 (hydrocarbon metabolic process), and GO:1901,810 (beta-carotene metabolic process). The cellular component category included GO:0,005,737 (cytoplasm) and GO:0,009,507 (chloroplast). The enriched GO terms were mainly related to the synthesis and decomposition of carotenoids, the catalytic activities of some enzymes, and the metabolic processes and sites of carotenoid-related substances. There are five GO terms directly related to carotenoid metabolism, accounting for one-third of the total number of GO terms, and the number of genes enriched in each GO term is at least 50 % of the number of CrCCO members, which may be the main factor for the formation of yellow and red fruits. The above results indicate the crucial role of carotenoids in fruit coloration during fruit ripening in Orah mandarin. KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the formation of the two flavedo colors and their associated pathways ( Y. Wang et al., 2023 ). Fig. 7 B shows that in Orah mandarin peels of different colors, the carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906), metabolic pathways (ko01100), and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (ko01110) pathways were significantly enriched in the CCO gene family, with 12 (85.7 %) of the genes enriched in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is basically in line with previous studies ( Su et al., 2021 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that these pathways are closely related to the components and content of carotenoids, which further demonstrates that the CCO gene family is widely involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and can regulate the metabolism of related substances and the expression of genes in the plant, which in turn decreases the original ratio of pigments in the flavedo and ultimately affects the development of Orah mandarin fruits and flavedo color formation. 3.7 Differences in carotenoid accumulation in Orah mandarin flavedo of different colors Metabolites are the basis of phenotype and genotype, and metabolomics technology is a helpful approach for analyzing the regulation of plant traits ( Jue et al., 2023 ). To investigate the pattern of variation in carotenoid composition and content in the peels of Orah mandarin fruits of different colors, we identified carotenoid metabolites in the samples via targeted metabolomic techniques on a UHPLC-MS platform. After quality assessment, a total of 15 carotenoid metabolites were identified from the peel samples, including α-carotene, γ-carotene, β-carotene, (E/Z)-phytoene, ε-carotene, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, apocarotenal, α-cryptoxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone and β-citraurin (Table S4). These carotenoids can be categorized into two main groups: carotenes (3.92 %) and lutein xanthophylls (96.08 %). By comparing the classification of carotenoid compounds, it was found that the total xanthophyll content was significantly greater in red peels than in yellow peels, and the total carotene content was almost unchanged. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the color difference was regulated by the composition and content of xanthophyll compounds. According to the PCA score plot, the cumulative contribution of the two principal components (PC1 63.58 % × PC2 24.05 %) reached 87.63 % ( Fig. 8 A). As shown in the figure, all of these samples have similar metabolite profiles, and yellow and red flavedo can be easily separated from them, which suggests that there is a significant difference in Orah mandarin metabolites between the two flavedo colors and that the biological replicates of each color can form a denser population. The metabolomic data of this sample were found to be biologically reproducible and reliable enough for subsequent qualitative and quantitative analysis. In this study, we used OPLS-DA to compare the carotenoid metabolites of different Orah mandarins ( Fig. 8 B). The results of OPLS-DA model validation showed that the R 2 Y and Q 2 values were greater than 0.9 ( p < 0.05), which indicated that these models were reliable and stable and were suitable for the present experiment. DAMs were also screened using VIP ≥ 1, p < 0.05, and fold change > 2 or < 0.5 as the criteria. The relative content of carotenoid pathways in Orah mandarin peels of different colors was analyzed by HCA thermograms, and the results showed that the peels were not uniform in color, the carotenoid compounds did not accumulate in the same pattern, and the six samples could be divided into two groups ( Fig. 8 C). As shown in the figure, the relative content of metabolites in yellow peels was distinctly different from that in red peels. The total carotenoids detected were 1010.1 μg/g and 1557 μg/g. Yellow peel was used as the control, and red peel was used as the treatment. Total carotenoids in the samples were upregulated by 54.1 % compared to those in the control group. The carotenoid composition and content significantly differed between the two colors of Orah mandarin. Based on the above criteria for DAM screening, we counted a total of five DAMs, namely, γ-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, apocarotenal, echinenone, and β-citraurin, among samples from each group, which all exhibited differentially upregulated metabolites. Notably, the highest fold changes in the expression of apocarotenal and β-citraurin were 8.6- and 18.1-fold, respectively, and these metabolites may be important determinants of Orah mandarin flavedo color formation. Therefore, we will focus on these DAMs in future studies. β-Citraurin has been detected in several citrus spp. ( C. clementina and C. sinensis ), and some Citrus varieties can reach 30 % of the total carotenoid content, which is a vital substance for the bright red color of citrus peels ( Luan et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2018 ; Yue et al., 2023 ). β-Citraurinene is a C30 carotenoid, consistent with the chemical formula of apocarotenal detected in the present study. Further inquiry revealed that β-citraurinene and apocarotenal are different names for the same substance, so apocarotenal was identified in the present study. β-Citraurin may be the crucial metabolite for the red color trait of Orah mandarin peel, which is in line with the results of previous studies ( M.J. Rodrigo et al., 2013 ; Zheng et al., 2021 , 2015 ). Moreover, an enzymatic degradation pathway or a nonenzymatic degradation pathway to reduce β-citraurin to apocarotenal may occur in the cells of Citrus spp. Therefore, when the ratio of the two metabolites changes, the total amount of C30 carotenoids in the peels does not change, which does not cause a change in color traits ( Zheng et al. 2019 ). 3.8 Correlation analysis of CCO gene expressions and carotenoid metabolites in Orah mandarin flavedo Correlation analysis of the expression levels of CrCCO genes and the metabolism levels of carotenoid metabolites was analyzed. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient to evaluate the relationship between CCO gene expressions and carotenoid metabolites, which was visualized as a correlation matrix based on Pearson's r-value. Fig. 9 A shows that 12 Orah mandarin CCOs were correlated with 13 carotenoid metabolites. Notably, there was a significant correlation between the gene expression levels of two of the CrCCO members ( CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5 ) and the levels of apocarotenal and β-citraurin detected in the samples, with R-values ranging from 0.81 to 0.84 ( p < 0.05), which was similar to the findings of Zhang et al. ( J. Zhang et al., 2023 ). In addition, the levels of CrCCD4a, CrNCED3, and the two DAMs mentioned above were negatively correlated but did not reach a significant level. A threshold of 0.05 for the p-value and 0.8 for the r-value was used as the screening criterion; some genes that did not meet these conditions were excluded, and the results were visualized as a correlation chord plot ( Fig. 9 B). As shown in the figure, the two genes, CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5, have many branches. However, many of the metabolite branches are connected to the gene, and it was also found that the correlation between these genes and apocarotenal and β-citraurin was significantly higher than that between the other genes and metabolites. It suggests that the two mentioned members of CrCCO s play crucial roles in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and may be jointly involved in the same substance synthesis and metabolism. Based on the results obtained from the screening conditions, we constructed a correlation network diagram ( Fig. 9 C) to visualize the connection between these CrCCOs and carotenoid metabolites. CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5 are located at the center of the whole correlation network, connecting multiple carotenoid metabolites and members of CrCCO , which are positively correlated with apocarotenal and β-citraurin and indirectly regulate the levels of these two DAMs through other metabolites. Based on the above analysis, we hypothesized that CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5 could positively regulate the metabolic levels of apocarotenal and β-citraurin in the flavedo, which would change the composition and content of carotenoids, thus causing the color of Orah mandarin fruits to change, showing a difference between yellow and red. Therefore, CrCCD4b1 and CrNCED5 are the vital genes involved in this process. Notably, in earlier studies, the CsCCD4b gene was shown to be a candidate gene for the formation of the red trait in sweet orange ( C. sinensis ) peels ( Zheng et al., 2019 , 2015 ). According to our evolutionary tree, the gene most closely related to CsCCD4b was CrCCD4b1 , so it is hypothesized that this gene may also play a crucial role in regulating the polymorphism of peel color. In addition, we found that the sequence similarity of the two genes was as high as 90.41 %. Therefore, we performed a comparative analysis of these two genes, including their structure, conserved structural domains, conserved motifs, and cis-acting elements. The results revealed (Figure S5) that these genes contain RPE65 structural domains, their subcellular localization is also in the cytoplasm, the compositions and positions of conserved motifs and cis-acting elements are very similar, and CsCCD4b has only an extra UTR compared with CrCCD4b1 . In physicochemical properties (Table S5), only the theoretical pI is different ( CsCCD4b is a fundamental protein, while CrCCD4b1 is an acidic protein), and the other properties are almost identical. Combined with the gene structure analysis (Figure S5B), we hypothesize that this is because the CsCCD4b gene has small segments of the UTR at the ends of the gene, whereas CrCCD4b1 does not, which leads to few differences between the two genes in the above analysis. We also submitted these two genes to the CPBD database for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. The results showed that the GO enrichment of both was concentrated on the GO term, and the KEGG enrichment was in the same pathway (K09840), which included carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906), metabolic pathways (ko01100) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (ko01110). In addition, the structures of both genes were also predicted, and the 3D structures were found to be very similar (Figure S5E). This further confirmed that CrCCD4b1 also plays functions in controlling the formation of flavedo color. 3.9 miRNA interaction network analysis miRNAs play crucial roles in the growth, development, and secondary metabolism of Orah mandarin. Through the prediction of miRNA targeting sites, we identified a total of 39 miRNAs that regulate 13 (92.9 %) CrCCOs through an inhibition mechanism (Figure S3) and only seven miRNAs that target CrCCO genes through translation; the remaining miRNAs regulate CrCCO gene expression through cleavage. Among them, CrNCED5 had the greatest number of targeted miRNAs, reaching 8; for the average value, each gene could be regulated by three miRNAs. In addition, we screened the target miRNAs associated with CrCCD4b1 and constructed a miRNA interaction network ( Fig. 10 ). The same miRNA could interact with multiple CrCCO genes, such as miR477d-3p and miR12105–3p, connected to two genes at their ends. In this figure, CrCCD4b1, CrNCED3 , and CrNCED5 are vital nodes of the interaction network and interact through miR477d-3p (cleavage) and miR12105–3p (translation). The above results indicate that CrCCD4b1, CrNCED3, and CrNCED5 can target multiple miRNA sites, forming a miRNA-gene-mRNA-regulated network, which participates in the posttranscriptional expression regulation of CrCCOs and ultimately affects the content and composition of carotenoids, resulting in Orah mandarin fruits at maturity exhibiting yellow, red and other colors. 3.10 Quantitative real-time PCR validation In this study, we analyzed four Orah mandarin CCO gene family members via qRT-PCR. The results (Figure S4) showed that the expression trends of the genes measured by qRT-PCR were generally consistent with those derived from RNA-seq analysis (R 2 =0.9922). These findings indicate that the RNA-seq data are reliable and can reflect the gene expression levels of Orah mandarin flavedo during the color change process. In this study, we identified the Orah mandarin CCO gene family and functionally characterized CrCCD4b1 , a gene related to the red peel trait, to reveal its role in carotenoid biosynthesis and Orah mandarin peel color change. Based on the results of this study, we proposed a specific regulatory model to analyze the CCO gene-mediated carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, which alters the color traits of Orah mandarin flavedo ( Fig. 11 ). Orah mandarin will change the expression of CrCCD4b1 after its flavedo senses the light difference under different light conditions. When the light becomes weaker, the expression of CrCCD4b1 increases and promotes the synthesis of apocarotenal and β-citraurin, thus increasing the content of red carotenoids in the flavedo. CrNCED5 is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes ABA biosynthesis, and it uses epoxy carotenoids as substrates to accumulate large amounts of ABA ( Sun et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). These ABAs can directly bind the promoters of carotenoid genes by stimulating regulatory modules, activating their expression, and promoting the accumulation of associated carotenoids. Thus, CrNCED5 can be considered a cofactor of CrCCD4b1 , which mediates an integrated regulatory network of C30 carotenoid metabolism by synthesizing ABA. With the gradual accumulation of apocarotenal and β-citraurin, the content of C30 carotenoids in the flavedo increased, thus affecting the composition and content of carotenoids and ultimately causing the flavedo to change from yellow to red. In summary, this study demonstrated that CrCCD4b1 , among the CrCCO gene family members, can directly and positively regulate the biosynthesis of C30 carotenoids (apocarotenal and β-citraurin) in the flavedo of Orah mandarin fruit and can serve as a vital candidate gene for the red color trait in the flavedo of Orah mandarin. However, the receptors in the flavedo cells that sense light changes and the signaling process after the cells sense the changes are not clear at present, which will be the focus of our future research. 4 Conclusion In this study, 14 CCO genes were identified and functionally characterized from the whole genome of Orah mandarin, and their expression profiles in Orah mandarin peel of different colors were investigated. The expression level of CrCCD4b1 was shown to affect flavedo color. It was also found that the color index and total carotenoid content of the red flavedo of Orah mandarin were greater than those of yellow Orah mandarin and that apocarotenal and β-citraurin were the prime metabolites in the flavedo that controlled the red flavedo traits. In addition, a model for C30 carotenoid (apocarotenal, β-citraurin) biosynthesis regulation in the flavedo of Orah mandarin by CrCCD4b1 is proposed. This study revealed a mechanism by which the CrCCO gene family regulates carotenoid biosynthesis, providing a theoretical basis for improving the color of the Orah mandarin peel.
