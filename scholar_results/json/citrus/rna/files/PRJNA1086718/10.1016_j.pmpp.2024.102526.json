    "full_text": "Citrus Alternaria brown spot (ABS) is among the most severe diseases that can impact growing citrus plants, representing a serious threat to mandarin and hybrid citrus orchards. The identification of specific genes associated with disease resistance can aid in the breeding of disease-resistant citrus varieties. Advances in genome-wide association study (GWAS) techniques provide an opportunity to more reliably assess the heritability of complex traits in citrus plants. We extracted 112,768 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 184 mandarin samples from a previous genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) study of 240 mandarins. Here, the resistance of 184 mandarins to ABS was then evaluated indoors based on the measurement of disease index (DI) values. A GWAS analysis was then conducted using a mixed linear model based on phenotypic data related to mandarin resistance to ABS and the identified SNPs. This strategy led to the identification of 36 significant SNPs on chromosome 3 and 1 significant SNP on chromosome 2 that were significantly correlated with citrus ABS resistance (P < 8.87✕10 −6 ). Next, 129 candidate genes were identified within the 40 Kb region upstream and downstream of these SNPs in the Clementina reference genome. Of these 129 candidate genes, transcriptomic data revealed that 28 were differentially expressed when comparing the ABS-resistant Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) variety and the susceptible Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) variety prior to and 24 h post-inoculation with Alternaria alternata strain THJ. Eight resistance protein family genes were identified, including CG053, CG087, CG089, and CG090 belonging to the TIR-NBS-LRR resistance protein family, the NB-ARC domain resistance proteins CG101, CG103, and CG124, and the serine/threonine kinase resistance gene CG105. Subsequent qPCR analyses revealed significant differences in the expression of six of these resistance protein genes at different time points following infection when comparing the susceptible and resistant varieties. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) results supported a role as regulators for CG053, CG089, and CG105 of citrus ABS resistance. Integrating the GWAS, RNA-seq and VIGS data, we ultimately identified three key regulatory genes (CG053, CG089, and CG105) involved in the regulation of citrus ABS resistance. This study shed light on the genetic basis of citrus ABS resistance, and provided a research premise for the research on the mechanism of citrus ABS resistance."

          "Citrus Alternaria brown spot (ABS) is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler that poses a threat to global citrus production. Since its initial detection in 1903 in Australia, outbreaks of ABS have been reported in Turkey [ 1 ], Israel[ 2 ], Spain [ 3 ], and China [ 4 ], among other regions. A. alternata is a nutritive fungus that can produce ACT (Alternaria citri Tangerine) toxins capable of inducing necrotic death of tissues in the host at the site of infection and spreading via the veins [ 5 ]. This pathogen can readily infect the young leaves, branches, and fruits of growing citrus plants, resulting in leaves exhibiting brown necrotic spots on the fruits and leaves. When severe, this disease can impair the viability of affected trees, causing defoliation and the loss of large quantities of fruits. Citrus ABS disease is regarded as the most important fungal disease that can impact growing citrus trees, and it is also the most serious disease capable of affecting citrus hybrids and reticulata citrus varieties [ 6–9 ]. If orchards plant highly susceptible citrus varieties or fail to enact proper preventative and control measures, they can readily suffer extensive losses. Chemical fungicides have been reportedly sprayed as frequently as 12 times per growth period on certain citrus plantations in Brazil, and even this approach cannot effectively prevent disease in highly susceptible varieties, contributing to a series of concerns pertaining to food safety, environmental safety, and the potential for the development of resistant pathogens. In Spain, some highly sensitive varieties, such as Fortune, were removed gradually from the market [ 10 ]. In China, the hybrid varieties, Jinqiu shatang ju and Sunshine No.1, are popular among consumers and are cultivated widely in southwestern China. These are new varieties bred using Ehime No.28 as their parent. Field monitoring and indoor analyses of disease resistance showed that these varieties were highly sensitive to citrus ABS (none reported).",
          "Efforts to grow disease-resistant citrus varieties have emerged as a primary approach to controlling and combatting citrus ABS. Owing to high levels of heterozygosity, hybrid citrus trees often vary substantially with respect to resistance and other characteristics such that varieties with certain desirable traits may often be detected. However, this variability also contributes to challenges when seeking to clarify the genetic basis for particular traits or to reliably breed citrus plants with specific characteristics. The prolonged juvenile period of citrus trees also prolongs the breeding cycle and compounds these difficulties. Advances in the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies combined with genomic resequencing can provide an opportunity to identify specific genetic variations associated with traits of interest, thereby aiding in the molecular marker-assisted breeding of citrus plants [ 11 ]. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches are commonly employed to explore the relationship between a given phenotype and particular polymorphisms across large populations based upon linkage disequilibrium. These analyses can accurately identify many different polymorphic sites to reveal resistance genes, providing a basis for the manipulation of these genes through molecular biology techniques in order to support disease resistance breeding. GWAS strategies have been employed to support the breeding of crop species including wheat [ 12 , 13 ], rice [ 14 ], and cotton [ 15 ], facilitating the successful identification of complex mutant genes. GWAS approaches can also facilitate the more efficient breeding of fruit trees [ 16 ]. Indeed, research efforts completed to date have enabled the combination of information pertaining to citrus fruit-related traits and large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from genomic sequencing datasets to enable GWAS analyses, ultimately identifying candidate genes and genomic regions associated with fruit quality [ 17 , 18 ] as well as flavonoid synthesis-related genes associated with the nutrient content in citrus fruits [ 19 ]. Researchers have also successfully utilized genomic resequencing data from 356 citrus germplasms to conduct a GWAS analysis of Huanglongbing resistance, yielding novel insights into the genetic factors that shape the pathogenesis of this devastating citrus disease [ 20 ]. While these prior reports highlight the value of conducting GWAS studies focused on complex traits in citrus populations as a means of supporting breeding efforts, no GWAS studies to date have been published focused on candidate genes associated with citrus ABS resistance.",
          "On the whole, research focused on citrus ABS resistance has remained relatively limited, with a single recessive allele having been identified as an important mediator of such resistance [ 21 ]. These resistance-related research efforts have, thus far, primarily focused on biochemical and physiological characteristics in citrus plants. For example, hexanoic acid has been demonstrated to enhance ABS resistance in citrus plants by augmenting physical barrier defenses and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling [ 22 ]. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping strategies have also been employed to detect loci associated with resistance to this fungal disease based on analyses of F 1 hybrids derived from the crossing of Licheng No.2 × Wanmi No.2 varieties [ 23 ]. Prior studies have also had success in the use of triploid citrus offspring to map genomic regions associated with citrus ABS resistance, identifying a resistance gene cluster within a 3.3 Mb region proximal to the centromeric region of chromosome 3 that was subsequently fine-mapped to a 366 Kb region harboring 9 candidate resistance-related genes [ 10 , 24 ]. Through analyses of resistant and susceptible citrus varieties (Clementina and Minola, respectively), researchers were also able to evaluate putative receptor proteins and resistance factors associated with the A. alternata- derived ACT toxin [ 25 ]. In one recent report, the complementary HRM and CAPS molecular methods were employed to evaluate the SNP08 ABS resistance marker to facilitate the more efficient screening of disease-resistant hybrid varieties with the goal of improving the genetic structure of breeding populations [ 26 ].",
          "In a prior study, researchers employed a high-throughput genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach to analyze 240 mandarin germplasms, yielding high-density SNP loci that were successfully used to conduct phylogenetic, population structure, and principal component analyses [ 27 ]. The high levels of genetic and phenotypic variation in this population were also conductive to a GWAS analysis approach [ 18 ]. Here, a GWAS strategy was thus implemented using extracted SNPs from 184 mandarin germplasms and data pertaining to citrus ABS resistance phenotypes in order to identify candidate resistance genes. Transcriptomic data and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) strategies were then employed to validate the identified candidate genes. Through these efforts, the present study seeks to provide a theoretical basis for future molecular disease resistance breeding efforts, while also offering an evidence-based foundation for future research focused on the genetics of citrus ABS resistance."

Sampled leaves were cleaned for 30 s with 75 % ethanol, rinsed three times with water, surface dried, and placed face up in a tray covered by a thin layer of cotton. The highly virulent A. alternata THJ strain was cultured for four days on complete PDA medium at 28 °C, after which a needle was used to inoculate a 5 mm fungal plug on the front of each leaf. Leaves were then incubated for two days at 28 °C (16 h light/8 h dark) in a 70–80 % relative humidity, after which the lesion area was measured for each diseased spot. All treatments were performed in triplicate, with 60 total leaves being analyzed. The disease index was calculated based on the ratio of lesion area to leaf area as follows: DI = ∑ ( x i × n i ) 9 n × 100 % , where xi represents the disease severity rating, ni represents the number of plants with that disease severity rating, and n represents the total number of plants evaluated. Disease severity was scored from 0 to 9 based on the number of symptomatic leaves as follows: 0 = no symptoms, 1 = < 15 % symptomatic, 3 = 15–30 % symptomatic, 5 = 30–40 % symptomatic, 7 = 40–50 % symptomatic, and 9 = > 50 % symptomatic [ 8 ].",

Four spring tips were used for one treatment at each sampling point, with each treatment being repeated four times. The survey was performed once per week from January–September, and once every other week from September–December.

A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using SNPs of the 184 accessions in the genome-wide mapping panel to estimate the influence of population structure. Principal component 1 (PC1) explained 38.64 % of the variation in the genotypic data, while PC2 and PC3 explained 17.04 % and 10.22 % of the variation, respectively. Based on the first three axes of the PCA, the population structure was not hierarchical, which was suitable for genome-wide association analysis ( Fig. 1 ).",

The distribution of resistance phenotypes was found to be largely right-skewed normally distributed ( Fig. 2 ). From 2021 to 2023, 12 varieties were routinely monitored for the development of citrus ABS disease, with the results being largely consistent with findings from indoor analyses of disease resistance ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Citrus ABS disease first investigated in the resource nursery in 2021, and with the exception of the Parson's special mandarin and Ellendale variety, all of these 12 varieties exhibited infected leaves in the spring with an average disease index value of 16.55. The two resistant varieties, Parson's special mandarin and Ellendale, were free of disease during the 3-year field investigation. When disease index values were initially calculated for these 184 citrus varieties in 2019, the values ranged from 0 to 70.37, with a coefficient of variation of 178.63. Over the course of the three-year field monitoring of the 12 varieties, the disease index values ranged from 0 to 47.50 in 2021 (coefficient of variation: 98.99), 0–59.72 in 2022 (coefficient of variation: 86.61), and 0–25.28 in 2023 (coefficient of variation: 103.12) ( Table 1 ). Three years of field monitoring data suggest that the results of our indoor resistant evaluation of resistant and susceptible varieties are reliable. The disease index of 184 mandarin from the Indoor analyses of disease resistance showed largely right-skewed normally distribution, which could be used for genome-wide association analysis."

In this study, the previous LD calculation results were used to find the genes in the 40 Kb strongly linked region of the significant SNPs, which may be the candidate genes related to ABS resistance. 129 candidate genes were subsequently identified within the 40 Kb regions upstream and downstream of these 37 SNP sites ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Further annotation efforts led to the identification of 9 candidate genes (CG053, CG087, CG089, CG090, CG101, CG102, CG103, CG105, and CG124) as resistance gene analogs (RGAs). Of these, CG053, CG087, CG089, and CG090 were identified as members of the TIR-NBS-LRR resistance protein family, while CG101, CG102, CG103, and CG124 contain NB-ARC domains, and CG105 is a serine/threonine kinase. To better understand the potential relationships between these 129 candidate genes and citrus ABS resistance, their changes in expression were compared in transcriptomic datasets collected at 24 h post-inoculation with A. alternata in the resistant (R) Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) variety and the susceptible (S) Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) variety ( Table 3 & Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This approach revealed 28 genes related to citrus ABS resistance, of which the expression levels of 12(CG002, CG011, CG016, CG052, CG057, CG060, CG066, CG100, CG101, CG106, CG111, and CG113) in susceptible varieties (Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka)) were higher than those in resistant varieties (Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf)), while 16 (CG021, CG053, CG056, CG059, CG073, CG083, CG089, CG090, CG105, CG120, CG121, CG122, CG123, CG124, CG125, and CG128) in resistant variety (Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf)) were higher than those in susceptible variety (Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka)). Among the nine genes annotated as disease-resistant proteins, CG053, CG089, CG090, CG105 and CG124 may upregulate resistance to ABS, CG101 may downregulate resistance to ABS, while CG087, CG102 and CG103 are not involved in the regulation of citrus ABS resistance. To understand the effects of allelic variation on citrus ABS resistance, we selected five SNPs that were significantly associated with six (CG053, CG089, CG090, CG105, CG101 and CG124) genes to identify the relationship between allelic variation and the disease index (DI). The SNP alleles were A/C, G/A, A/C, T/C and A/G, respectively. For the first peak SNP (A3_16817548), the average DI of accessions with alleles (AA) was 1.46, which was lower than the average DI (20.65) of accessions with alleles (CC). The average DI was 1.33 of allele (GG) in SNP (A3_23775932), which was significantly lower than the average DI (17.68) of allele (AA). The average DI was 0.81 of allele (AA) in SNP (A3_24997361), which was significantly lower than the average DI (16.81) of allele (CC). The average DI was 1.31 of allele (TT) in SNP (A3_29033460), which was significantly lower than the average DI (19.51) of allele (CC). The average DI was 1.66 of allele (AA) in SNP (A3_36633265), which was significantly lower than the average DI (21.57) of allele (GG) ( Fig. 4 ). These results indicate that the genotype variation of SNPs alleles is significantly corresponded to the phenotype of disease resistance.",
              "A qPCR approach was subsequently used to evaluate the expression of six of these candidate resistance genes (CG053, CG089, CG090, CG101, CG105, and CG124), revealing significant differences in the expression of all of these genes at different time points following A. alternata inoculation when comparing the resistant Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) and susceptible Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) varieties ( Fig. 5 & Supplementary Table 4 ). In the susceptible Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) infected by THJ strain, the expression of six genes peaked only at 48 h. In the resistant Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) infected by THJ strain, CG053, CG089, CG090, and CG101 all had an expression peak at early 6 h and late 48–72 h, CG124 had an expression peak at 6 h, 36 h, and 72 h, and CG105 was inhibited at 0–72 h. The results showed that the expression levels of CG053, CG090, CG101, and CG124 in resistant variety were higher than those in susceptible variety, which may be candidate genes for resistance to ABS. The expression levels of CG089 and CG105 in susceptible variety were higher than those in resistant variety, which may be candidate genes of susceptible to ABS. Among them, the qPCR results of CG089 and CG105 were inconsistent with the transcriptome, which may be due to the fact that the transcriptome data in this study were only the results of a single time point of 24 h of A. alternata strain THJ infection of Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) and Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf), the qPCR results of seven consecutive time periods can truly reveal the changes in the expression levels of candidate genes in resistant and susceptible varieties. Therefore, we mainly use qPCR results. These results support a potential role for these genes as mediators of citrus ABS resistance."

              "A VIGS approach was next utilized to explore the roles that these six candidate genes play in citrus ABS resistance by constructing individual recombinant pTRV2 vectors for each of these genes that were subsequently used for co-infection along with the pTRV1 vector. At 4 weeks post-infection, no differences were noted between the phenotypes of the control and VIGS plants. The specific bands of wild plant identified by TRV1 and TRV2 specific primers could not be amplified, and the specific bands of 200 bp could be identified successfully for Agrobacterium infection. However, qPCR validation confirmed the successful downregulation of all 6 of these genes in the respective VIGS plants relative to controls. Following the fungal inoculation of isolated leaves from these plants, lesion diameters were measured after 2 days, revealing that the average lesion diameter in pTRV2-CG053 silenced plants was increased, whereas the average lesion diameter in pTRV2-CG089 and pTRV2-CG105 silenced plants was significant decreased relative to controls, and no significant differences in lesion size were observed when comparing the pTRV2-CG090, pTRV2-GC101, and pTRV2-CG124 silenced plants to controls ( Fig. 6 ). This suggests that CG053, CG089, and CG105 represent promising candidate genes that may be related to citrus ABS resistance."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Breeding for resistant citrus varieties has gradually emerged as the most effective approach to persistently preventing and controlling the spread of citrus ABS disease. In prior studies, mandarins and hybrid citrus varieties have been shown to be particularly sensitive to ABS disease, whereas lemons, grapefruits, and sweet oranges are far more resistant. Environmental factors such as a Mediterranean or tropical climate can also contribute to greater citrus sensitivity to citrus ABS. The evaluation of disease-resistant citrus germplasm resources can aid in the identification of varieties with superior resistance, providing a theoretical foundation for the selective breeding of more resistant varieties [ 9 , 28–30 ]. Indoor analyses of disease resistance provide one means of evaluating disease resistance under more controlled conditions by excluding the impact of environmental variables on disease phenotypes and ensuring that the utilized samples and pathogen inoculation conditions are uniform. For the present study, 184 mandarin germplasms were assessed for ABS resistance under laboratory conditions. This method, however, is subject to certain limitations. For one, disease symptoms are generally more severe on detached leaves that have been inoculated as compared to infections in vivo [ 7 ]. There are also inherent limits to the use of just one fungal strain when assessing disease resistance, given that particular strains may exhibit greater pathogenicity when infecting certain varieties of citrus plants. The THJ strain used to conduct the present study exhibits a high degree of toxicity to maximize the reliability of these efforts to characterize disease resistance. As many different factors affect the development of ABS disease under field conditions, a three-year field survey of 12 citrus varieties was also conducted based on the results of initial indoor analyses. The field monitoring data were basically consistent in 2021–2022. At the same time, due to the extreme hot weather from August to October 2022 in this region, the disease incidence was relatively light during the investigation of spring tip leaves in 2023. So the field disease index of 12 citrus varieties monitored in 2023 was significantly different from the data in 2021–2022. However, the results of these three field surveys yielded can also verify the reliability of the indoor analysis method.",
          "We extracted 112,768 high-quality SNPs from 184 mandarin germplasms from a previous genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) study of 240 mandarin germplasms. Population structure and evolutionary characterization of 184 mandarin germplasms were obtained through Wang et al. [ 27 ] and complied with GWAS analysis. Here, a GWAS approach was thus used to identify citrus ABS resistance-related genes. In total, 36 SNPs significantly associated with resistance were identified in the 9336217 and 36633265 genomic regions of chromosome 3 in the Clementina reference genome. In line with these results, a prior diploid fine-mapping study focused on citrus ABS resistance also mapped a locus between bases 2596094 and 25862085 on chromosome 3 [ 10 ], partially overlapping with the abovementioned resistance region, albeit without the mapping of the same significant resistance-related SNPs. Further candidate gene analyses revealed that CG093 (CICLE_10021676m) at A3_24838146, CG097 (CICLE_v10022372m) at A3_24942210, and CG101 (CICLE_v10023902m) and CG102 (CICLE_v10024232m) at A3_24997361 were all included in prior sequencing fragments. These results support partial overlap between the resistance-related loci identified in this study and those reported previously, emphasizing the suitability of this population of 184 mandarin germplasms for use when identifying significant SNPs associated with ABS resistance. These significant SNPs did not overlap with previous reports for chromosome 3, suggesting that this may correspond to a novel resistance locus.",
          "In trait-SNP association analyses, the significant SNPs were found to be primarily concentrated on chromosome 3, suggesting that this is the primary locus for ABS resistance heritability. Comparative genomic analyses have revealed that hundreds of NBS-LRR genes are often encoded in clusters within the genomes of particular plants [ 31 , 32 ]. Physical or genetic mapping efforts often reveal clusters of resistance genes [ 33 ]. Consistently, the chromosome 3 resistance locus identified in the present study was found to encode multiple NB-LRR genes, with 9 resistance genes within the analyzed 16–30 Mb region of this chromosome. We selected Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) variety and the Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) variety, which are representative and widely cultivated in southwest China, and evaluated the transcriptomic analyses of ABS response. In total, 104 disease resistance protein families were identified on chromosome 3 ( Supplementary Table 7 ), including 76 TIR-NBS-LRR genes, 10 genes encoding proteins with NB-ARC domains, 9 encoding proteins with NB-ARC and LRR domains, and 9 encoding LRR-like protein kinase family proteins ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The TIR-NBS-LRR resistance proteins were the most highly expressed targets on chromosome 3, suggesting that they may correspond to the primary candidate genes that confer ABS resistance.",
          "A range of resistance proteins have been cloned from different plant species, including members of the NB-LRR and LRR protein kinase families. NB-LRR proteins can be further classified based on their N-terminal structures into TIR-NBS-LRR and CC-NBS-LRR resistance proteins. The recognition of pathogens by plants can occur through both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms, the latter of which is mediated by receptor proteins or receptor kinases on the cell surface [ 34 ]. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors within cells can additionally detect any effector molecules that are transferred into cells. TIR domain activity can facilitate resistance-related signal transduction and specific pathogen recognition. Proteins with a TIR structure can tetramerize and catalyze NAD + hydrolysis, mediating downstream immune-related signal transduction and controlling cellular death [ 35 , 36 ]. NBS domain binding to ADP or ATP can influence the conformational characteristics of disease resistance proteins and thereby shape downstream disease resistance signaling. LRR domains can direct or indirectly interact with pathogen-associated proteins to facilitate the specific detection of these pathogens. Effector-mediated resistance protein activation can then induce various protective responses such as the rapid release of high reactive oxygen species levels that contribute to allergic necrosis [ 37 ]. NB-LRR proteins are capable of directly binding to pathogen-associated effectors, or indirectly recognizing these effectors through interactions with resistance protein co-factors that recognize or modify these effectors [ 38 ]. The rice NB-LRR proteins RGA4 and RGA5 have been reported to directly bind and recognize the effectors AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia [ 39 ]. The TIR domain of the Nicotiana benthamiana ROQ3 resistance protein can also directly interact with the Xanthomonas euvesicatoria effector XopQ, resulting in the generation of a tetrameric structure that can initiate downstream immune-related signaling [ 40 ]. The Arabidopsis TIR-NBS-LRR resistance protein RPP1 associates with the ATR1 effector protein in the context of Peronospora parasitism via its LRR domain, whereupon its TIR domain can induce hypersensitive cellular necrosis [ 41 ]. The TIR domain of the TIR-NBS-LRR resistance protein CSA1 can also drive accelerated cellular necrosis and influence the invasivity of certain pathogens [ 42 ]. Plant leucine-rich receptor kinase proteins can detect a range of extracellular pathogen-associated peptides [ 43 ], as in the case of the tomato FLS3 protein that is capable of binding to FLS2-28 receptors to enhance immune response induction [ 44 ]. Based on the results of previous studies, the research speculated that TIR-NBS-LRR disease resistance proteins CG053 and CG089 and LRR-Pkinase protein CG105 may rapidly recognize pathogen effect factors that break through PTI immunity through TIR domain or LRR domain, causing their own protein conformation changes. Activate the NBS nucleotide binding domain, transmit immune signals downstream, and initiate the ETI immune defense response of plants. The specific defense mechanism involved and the downstream immune response caused by them still need further research.",
          "In conclusion, a VIGS approach in the present study revealed that the CG053 and CG089 genes encoding homologs of Arabidopsis TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and the CG105 gene encoding a homolog of an Arabidopsis LRR-Pkinase protein were associated with ABS disease resistance. The molecular mechanisms through which these genes contribute to such resistance and related downstream signaling pathways, however, remain to be evaluated in future studies."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Citrus Alternaria brown spot (ABS) is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler that poses a threat to global citrus production. Since its initial detection in 1903 in Australia, outbreaks of ABS have been reported in Turkey [ 1 ], Israel[ 2 ], Spain [ 3 ], and China [ 4 ], among other regions. A. alternata is a nutritive fungus that can produce ACT (Alternaria citri Tangerine) toxins capable of inducing necrotic death of tissues in the host at the site of infection and spreading via the veins [ 5 ]. This pathogen can readily infect the young leaves, branches, and fruits of growing citrus plants, resulting in leaves exhibiting brown necrotic spots on the fruits and leaves. When severe, this disease can impair the viability of affected trees, causing defoliation and the loss of large quantities of fruits. Citrus ABS disease is regarded as the most important fungal disease that can impact growing citrus trees, and it is also the most serious disease capable of affecting citrus hybrids and reticulata citrus varieties [ 6–9 ]. If orchards plant highly susceptible citrus varieties or fail to enact proper preventative and control measures, they can readily suffer extensive losses. Chemical fungicides have been reportedly sprayed as frequently as 12 times per growth period on certain citrus plantations in Brazil, and even this approach cannot effectively prevent disease in highly susceptible varieties, contributing to a series of concerns pertaining to food safety, environmental safety, and the potential for the development of resistant pathogens. In Spain, some highly sensitive varieties, such as Fortune, were removed gradually from the market [ 10 ]. In China, the hybrid varieties, Jinqiu shatang ju and Sunshine No.1, are popular among consumers and are cultivated widely in southwestern China. These are new varieties bred using Ehime No.28 as their parent. Field monitoring and indoor analyses of disease resistance showed that these varieties were highly sensitive to citrus ABS (none reported). Efforts to grow disease-resistant citrus varieties have emerged as a primary approach to controlling and combatting citrus ABS. Owing to high levels of heterozygosity, hybrid citrus trees often vary substantially with respect to resistance and other characteristics such that varieties with certain desirable traits may often be detected. However, this variability also contributes to challenges when seeking to clarify the genetic basis for particular traits or to reliably breed citrus plants with specific characteristics. The prolonged juvenile period of citrus trees also prolongs the breeding cycle and compounds these difficulties. Advances in the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies combined with genomic resequencing can provide an opportunity to identify specific genetic variations associated with traits of interest, thereby aiding in the molecular marker-assisted breeding of citrus plants [ 11 ]. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches are commonly employed to explore the relationship between a given phenotype and particular polymorphisms across large populations based upon linkage disequilibrium. These analyses can accurately identify many different polymorphic sites to reveal resistance genes, providing a basis for the manipulation of these genes through molecular biology techniques in order to support disease resistance breeding. GWAS strategies have been employed to support the breeding of crop species including wheat [ 12 , 13 ], rice [ 14 ], and cotton [ 15 ], facilitating the successful identification of complex mutant genes. GWAS approaches can also facilitate the more efficient breeding of fruit trees [ 16 ]. Indeed, research efforts completed to date have enabled the combination of information pertaining to citrus fruit-related traits and large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from genomic sequencing datasets to enable GWAS analyses, ultimately identifying candidate genes and genomic regions associated with fruit quality [ 17 , 18 ] as well as flavonoid synthesis-related genes associated with the nutrient content in citrus fruits [ 19 ]. Researchers have also successfully utilized genomic resequencing data from 356 citrus germplasms to conduct a GWAS analysis of Huanglongbing resistance, yielding novel insights into the genetic factors that shape the pathogenesis of this devastating citrus disease [ 20 ]. While these prior reports highlight the value of conducting GWAS studies focused on complex traits in citrus populations as a means of supporting breeding efforts, no GWAS studies to date have been published focused on candidate genes associated with citrus ABS resistance. On the whole, research focused on citrus ABS resistance has remained relatively limited, with a single recessive allele having been identified as an important mediator of such resistance [ 21 ]. These resistance-related research efforts have, thus far, primarily focused on biochemical and physiological characteristics in citrus plants. For example, hexanoic acid has been demonstrated to enhance ABS resistance in citrus plants by augmenting physical barrier defenses and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling [ 22 ]. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping strategies have also been employed to detect loci associated with resistance to this fungal disease based on analyses of F 1 hybrids derived from the crossing of Licheng No.2 × Wanmi No.2 varieties [ 23 ]. Prior studies have also had success in the use of triploid citrus offspring to map genomic regions associated with citrus ABS resistance, identifying a resistance gene cluster within a 3.3 Mb region proximal to the centromeric region of chromosome 3 that was subsequently fine-mapped to a 366 Kb region harboring 9 candidate resistance-related genes [ 10 , 24 ]. Through analyses of resistant and susceptible citrus varieties (Clementina and Minola, respectively), researchers were also able to evaluate putative receptor proteins and resistance factors associated with the A. alternata- derived ACT toxin [ 25 ]. In one recent report, the complementary HRM and CAPS molecular methods were employed to evaluate the SNP08 ABS resistance marker to facilitate the more efficient screening of disease-resistant hybrid varieties with the goal of improving the genetic structure of breeding populations [ 26 ]. In a prior study, researchers employed a high-throughput genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach to analyze 240 mandarin germplasms, yielding high-density SNP loci that were successfully used to conduct phylogenetic, population structure, and principal component analyses [ 27 ]. The high levels of genetic and phenotypic variation in this population were also conductive to a GWAS analysis approach [ 18 ]. Here, a GWAS strategy was thus implemented using extracted SNPs from 184 mandarin germplasms and data pertaining to citrus ABS resistance phenotypes in order to identify candidate resistance genes. Transcriptomic data and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) strategies were then employed to validate the identified candidate genes. Through these efforts, the present study seeks to provide a theoretical basis for future molecular disease resistance breeding efforts, while also offering an evidence-based foundation for future research focused on the genetics of citrus ABS resistance. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Experimental materials The 184 mandarin germplasms used for indoor disease resistance evaluation were all collected from citrus germplasm resource trees preserved in the resource garden of the Citrus Research Institute of Southwest University. These germplasms were derived from various regions at different points in time, and include 15 wild mandarin varieties, 71 landraces, 91 selected varieties, and 7 genetic materials originating in southern China. These 184 germplasms included 40 Wenzhou mandarins from Japan, 32 from Europe and the United States, and 5 from Nepal, while the remainder were from China. The highly virulent A. alternata THJ strain was preserved by the comprehensive prevention research group of the Citrus Research Institute of Southwest University. After selecting healthy young leaves of the disease-resistant Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) seedling (Beibei citrus orchard in Chongqing, China) and the disease-susceptible Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) seedling (Wanzhou Hongju orchard in Chongqing, China) spring tips, this THJ strain was cultured for 4 days by live puncture-based inoculation in a humidified 28 °C environment with 70–80 % relative humidity (16 h light/8 h dark), with samples being collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h post-inoculation for qRT-PCR study. Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) seeds were taken from ripe fruits in November (Wanzhou Hongju orchard in Chongqing, China). Briefly, the surfaces of harvested fruits were disinfected using 75 % ethanol, after which the peel was removed to review the seeds. The gum on the surface of these seeds was removed, and the seed coat was peeled away, after which seeds were planted in sand and allowed to germinate until producing a 2–3 cm radicle for VIGS silencing studies. 2.2 Disease resistance analyses Indoor analyses of disease resistance were conducted using the young leaves of the spring tips of the 184 mandarin varieties. Sampled leaves were cleaned for 30 s with 75 % ethanol, rinsed three times with water, surface dried, and placed face up in a tray covered by a thin layer of cotton. The highly virulent A. alternata THJ strain was cultured for four days on complete PDA medium at 28 °C, after which a needle was used to inoculate a 5 mm fungal plug on the front of each leaf. Leaves were then incubated for two days at 28 °C (16 h light/8 h dark) in a 70–80 % relative humidity, after which the lesion area was measured for each diseased spot. All treatments were performed in triplicate, with 60 total leaves being analyzed. The disease index was calculated based on the ratio of lesion area to leaf area as follows: DI = ∑ ( x i × n i ) 9 n × 100 % , where xi represents the disease severity rating, ni represents the number of plants with that disease severity rating, and n represents the total number of plants evaluated. Disease severity was scored from 0 to 9 based on the number of symptomatic leaves as follows: 0 = no symptoms, 1 = < 15 % symptomatic, 3 = 15–30 % symptomatic, 5 = 30–40 % symptomatic, 7 = 40–50 % symptomatic, and 9 = > 50 % symptomatic [ 8 ]. Based on the results of indoor analyses of ABS resistance, 10 susceptible varieties and 2 immune varieties were selected for field monitoring for ABS resistance over three consecutive years. Field monitoring was performed in the resource garden of the Citrus Research Institute of Southwest University using a five-point (eastern, western, southern, northern, and central). Four spring tips were used for one treatment at each sampling point, with each treatment being repeated four times. The survey was performed once per week from January–September, and once every other week from September–December. Disease index scoring under field conditions was performed by assessing symptomatic leaves with the following criteria: 0 = no symptoms, 1 = < 5 % symptomatic, 3 = 5–10 % symptomatic, 5 = 10–25 % symptomatic, 7 = 25–50 % symptomatic, 9 = > 50 % symptomatic. 2.3 Genotypic sequencing The GBS sequencing data, related marker information and population structure analysis of 184 mandarin germplasm were obtained from the Wang et al. [ 27 ]. The GBS sequencing of 240 mandarin samples produced 96.3 Gb of high quality sequence data (Q20 ≥ 93.78 %, Q30 ≥ 85.19 %), the GC distribution was normal, and the average comparison rate between the population sample and the reference genome of Clementina was 93.79 %. After filtering at a 4 × sequencing depth, miss 0.2, and a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01, 114,200 high-quality SNPs were obtained. Then, 112,768 high-quality SNPs of 184 mandarins were extracted from the simplified genomes of 240 mandarins (reference genome: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000493195.1_Citrus_clementina_v1.0 ) by PLINK1.9 software. The genotype SNP data has uploaded Mendeley Data (DOI: 10.17632/s2sg3ktm48.1). 2.4 Population structure analysis Sun [ 18 ] constructed a population phylogenetic tree based on 112,768 SNPs, used TreeBest software to calculate the distance matrix, and constructed a phylogenetic tree by the Neighbor-Joining (bootstrap values 1000). 184 natural populations of mandarin were divided into 11 subgroups ( Supplementary Table 1 ). In this study, the genotypes of 184 mandarin were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) by PLINK1.9 software and later plotted by ggplot2. 2.5 Genome-wide association study A mixed linear model (MLM) was used to conduct a trait association analysis in the GEMMA ( https://www.xzlab.org/software.html ) software. Significance SNPs were screened by correlation significance (P-value). The F-value was used to test for significant differences in phenotypic traits associated with allelic loci in this GWAS analysis, and GEMMA was used to generate Manhattan plots and QQ-plots. 2.6 Transcriptome data In order to save screening time, transcriptome expression profiles were used to screen differentially expressed candidate genes. The transcriptomic samples were collected at 24 h post-inoculation with A. alternata from the young leaf of resistant (R) Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) variety and the young leaf of susceptible (S) Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) variety, and each treatment was repeated three times. Transcriptome sequencing was commissioned by Guangzhou GENE DENOVO Biotechnology company. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, construct RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries, and sequenced using Illumina Novaseq 6000 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co (Guangzhou, China). Raw reads were obtained after sequencing, and Clean reads were obtained after Raw reads were filtered out of impurities. After the data quality assessment was qualified, the Clean reads were aligned to the Clementina reference genome sequence using STAR software, and then the gene expression was quantified by RSEM software, and the differentially expressed genes between samples were screened by edgeR software, |log2 (fc)|≥1 and FDR<0.05 were used to filter significantly differentially expressed genes. Data is uploaded to the SRA database on the NCBI public platform (Accession number: PRJNA1086718). 2.7 Identification of candidate genes associated with ABS resistance According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) public database, the Clementina most closely resembles the mandarin and hybrid. Therefore, the Clementina genome was selected as the reference genome. The SNPs significantly associated with citrus ABS resistance in the above GWAS study were selected, and regions located within 40 Kb upstream or downstream of these trait-related SNPs were selected as candidate resistance gene regions. The genes in these regions were evaluated using the GO, KEGG, and SwissProt databases. Changes in the expression of these genes were compared in the transcriptomic datasets collected at 24 h post-inoculation with A. alternata from the resistant (R) Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) variety and the susceptible (S) Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) variety, focusing specifically on candidate genes related to ABS resistance and their associated pathways. A Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme, China) was used to extract total RNA from the leaves post-inoculation of Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) and Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf), after which One-Step RT-PCR Kit Reverse Transcriptase was used to prepare cDNA, and the SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) was used to conduct qPCR analyses with a CFX Connect™ Real-Time PCR System. Thermocycler settings were: 95 °C for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s. Actin was used as the internal control gene, relative target gene expression was assessed via the 2 −ΔΔCT method. Three biological and three technical replicates were established per experimental treatment. Each PCR amplification reaction consisted of 4 μL of template cDNA, 2 μL of upstream and downstream primers, 25 μL of 2✕ Primer Star Mix, and ddH 2 O to a final volume of 50 μL. Thermocycler settings were: 98 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 3 min. The qPCR and VIGS-specific primers used for this study are compiled in Supplementary Table 5 , and these primers were designed to avoid conserved domains in candidate genes. 2.8 VIGS analyses of candidate resistance genes Target fragments corresponding to six candidate genes were amplified from cDNA prepared from Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) samples and inserted into the pTRV2 vector using a double enzyme digestion approach to yield recombinant pTRV2-CG053/CG089/CG090/CG101/CG105/CG124 vectors. These vectors were then transferred into Agrobacterium EHA105 (WEIDI, China). The agrobacterium strains carrying these vectors were then combined at a 1:1 ratio with agrobacterium strains carrying the pTRV1 vector, and the mixture was used for the co-infection of seeds of germinated 2–3 cm radicles of Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) plants under negative pressure (−1 kPa). After four weeks, DNA was rapidly extracted from VIGS-treated leaves and was amplified by PCR using TRV1- and TRV2-specific primers to confirm the success of the Agrobacterium transfection. Total RNA was then extracted from the leaves, and the efficiency of VIGS interference was determined by qPCR. The highly virulent A. alternata THJ strain was cultured for four days on complete PDA medium at 28 °C, after which a needle was used to inoculate a 5 mm fungal plug on the upper surfaces of leaves showing positive interference. The leaves were then incubated for two days at 28 °C (16 h light/8 h dark cycle) in an environment with 70–80 % relative humidity, after which the lesion area for each diseased spot was measured environment. 3 Results 3.1 Population structure and Mandarin ABS resistance For the present analysis, 184 mandarin germplasms representing a range of varieties were evaluated. These samples were previously separated into four different subgroups based on mandarin affinities, including group I (satsuma subgroup, including satsuma mandarin, zaoshu miju, and Nova varieties), group II (wild mandarin subgroup, including Xipi goushi gan, Dakeng yeju, Niedu yeju No.1, Mangshan ju, Cupi Goushi gan, and Daoxian yeju varieties), group III (including Ooura wase, Hayaka, and Tangor 22–53 varieties), and group IV (the remaining germplasms and hybrids thereof, including Suanju, Nianju, Ponkan, Hongju, Zhuhong ju, Mediterranean mandarin, Zaoju 79–6, Tangor or Pomelo hybrid, and Clementina varieties) [ 27 ]. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using SNPs of the 184 accessions in the genome-wide mapping panel to estimate the influence of population structure. Principal component 1 (PC1) explained 38.64 % of the variation in the genotypic data, while PC2 and PC3 explained 17.04 % and 10.22 % of the variation, respectively. Based on the first three axes of the PCA, the population structure was not hierarchical, which was suitable for genome-wide association analysis ( Fig. 1 ). A high degree of citrus ABS resistance was observed when analyzing these germplasms, including 61 immune varieties, 94 highly resistant varieties, 19 resistant varieties, 5 tolerance varieties, 5 susceptible varieties, and 1 highly susceptible variety ( Supplementary Table 1 ). The distribution of resistance phenotypes was found to be largely right-skewed normally distributed ( Fig. 2 ). From 2021 to 2023, 12 varieties were routinely monitored for the development of citrus ABS disease, with the results being largely consistent with findings from indoor analyses of disease resistance ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Citrus ABS disease first investigated in the resource nursery in 2021, and with the exception of the Parson's special mandarin and Ellendale variety, all of these 12 varieties exhibited infected leaves in the spring with an average disease index value of 16.55. The two resistant varieties, Parson's special mandarin and Ellendale, were free of disease during the 3-year field investigation. When disease index values were initially calculated for these 184 citrus varieties in 2019, the values ranged from 0 to 70.37, with a coefficient of variation of 178.63. Over the course of the three-year field monitoring of the 12 varieties, the disease index values ranged from 0 to 47.50 in 2021 (coefficient of variation: 98.99), 0–59.72 in 2022 (coefficient of variation: 86.61), and 0–25.28 in 2023 (coefficient of variation: 103.12) ( Table 1 ). Three years of field monitoring data suggest that the results of our indoor resistant evaluation of resistant and susceptible varieties are reliable. The disease index of 184 mandarin from the Indoor analyses of disease resistance showed largely right-skewed normally distribution, which could be used for genome-wide association analysis. 3.2 GWAS analyses Next, an analysis of the association between resistance phenotypes and SNPs was conducted in GEMMA using a mixed linear model (MLM), after which Manhattan plots and QQ-plots were generated ( Fig. 3 ). For these analyses, the GWAS threshold was set to P < 8.87✕10 −6 (1/total SNPs, –log 10 P = 5.05). The resultant data revealed that the significant SNPs were primarily located on chromosomes 3 (n = 36) and chromosomes 2 (n = 1) ( Table 2 ). To confirm the reliability of the association between significant SNPs and citrus ABS, these GWAS results were compared to prior findings. A significant SNP (A3_24997361) on chromosome 3 was found to have previously been mapped to this region in a fine-mapping analysis of genes associated with citrus ABS resistance, offering support for the present findings [ 24 ]. Given that several other resistance-related loci beyond this SNP on chromosome 3 were also identified herein, subsequent analyses were next performed to more fully clarify the genetic basis for such disease resistance. 3.3 Identification of candidate genes associated with citrus ABS resistance Next, the 37 significant SNPs on chromosomes 3 and chromosomes 2 were analyzed in greater detail. The Manhattan and QQ-plot diagrams suggested that the locus exhibiting a –log 10 P > 6 may represent the major genetic locus responsible for resistance to citrus ABS disease in these plants. In 2018, Sun of this research institute has used 240 GBS genome sequencing data of mandarin germplasms to conduct GWAS with related traits of mandarin fruits, and calculated that the region strongly linked with SNPs is 40 Kb upstream and downstream through linkage analysis of Linkage disequilibrium (LD) [ 18 ]. In this study, the previous LD calculation results were used to find the genes in the 40 Kb strongly linked region of the significant SNPs, which may be the candidate genes related to ABS resistance. 129 candidate genes were subsequently identified within the 40 Kb regions upstream and downstream of these 37 SNP sites ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Further annotation efforts led to the identification of 9 candidate genes (CG053, CG087, CG089, CG090, CG101, CG102, CG103, CG105, and CG124) as resistance gene analogs (RGAs). Of these, CG053, CG087, CG089, and CG090 were identified as members of the TIR-NBS-LRR resistance protein family, while CG101, CG102, CG103, and CG124 contain NB-ARC domains, and CG105 is a serine/threonine kinase. To better understand the potential relationships between these 129 candidate genes and citrus ABS resistance, their changes in expression were compared in transcriptomic datasets collected at 24 h post-inoculation with A. alternata in the resistant (R) Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) variety and the susceptible (S) Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) variety ( Table 3 & Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This approach revealed 28 genes related to citrus ABS resistance, of which the expression levels of 12(CG002, CG011, CG016, CG052, CG057, CG060, CG066, CG100, CG101, CG106, CG111, and CG113) in susceptible varieties (Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka)) were higher than those in resistant varieties (Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf)), while 16 (CG021, CG053, CG056, CG059, CG073, CG083, CG089, CG090, CG105, CG120, CG121, CG122, CG123, CG124, CG125, and CG128) in resistant variety (Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf)) were higher than those in susceptible variety (Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka)). Among the nine genes annotated as disease-resistant proteins, CG053, CG089, CG090, CG105 and CG124 may upregulate resistance to ABS, CG101 may downregulate resistance to ABS, while CG087, CG102 and CG103 are not involved in the regulation of citrus ABS resistance. To understand the effects of allelic variation on citrus ABS resistance, we selected five SNPs that were significantly associated with six (CG053, CG089, CG090, CG105, CG101 and CG124) genes to identify the relationship between allelic variation and the disease index (DI). The SNP alleles were A/C, G/A, A/C, T/C and A/G, respectively. For the first peak SNP (A3_16817548), the average DI of accessions with alleles (AA) was 1.46, which was lower than the average DI (20.65) of accessions with alleles (CC). The average DI was 1.33 of allele (GG) in SNP (A3_23775932), which was significantly lower than the average DI (17.68) of allele (AA). The average DI was 0.81 of allele (AA) in SNP (A3_24997361), which was significantly lower than the average DI (16.81) of allele (CC). The average DI was 1.31 of allele (TT) in SNP (A3_29033460), which was significantly lower than the average DI (19.51) of allele (CC). The average DI was 1.66 of allele (AA) in SNP (A3_36633265), which was significantly lower than the average DI (21.57) of allele (GG) ( Fig. 4 ). These results indicate that the genotype variation of SNPs alleles is significantly corresponded to the phenotype of disease resistance. A qPCR approach was subsequently used to evaluate the expression of six of these candidate resistance genes (CG053, CG089, CG090, CG101, CG105, and CG124), revealing significant differences in the expression of all of these genes at different time points following A. alternata inoculation when comparing the resistant Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) and susceptible Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) varieties ( Fig. 5 & Supplementary Table 4 ). In the susceptible Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) infected by THJ strain, the expression of six genes peaked only at 48 h. In the resistant Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) infected by THJ strain, CG053, CG089, CG090, and CG101 all had an expression peak at early 6 h and late 48–72 h, CG124 had an expression peak at 6 h, 36 h, and 72 h, and CG105 was inhibited at 0–72 h. The results showed that the expression levels of CG053, CG090, CG101, and CG124 in resistant variety were higher than those in susceptible variety, which may be candidate genes for resistance to ABS. The expression levels of CG089 and CG105 in susceptible variety were higher than those in resistant variety, which may be candidate genes of susceptible to ABS. Among them, the qPCR results of CG089 and CG105 were inconsistent with the transcriptome, which may be due to the fact that the transcriptome data in this study were only the results of a single time point of 24 h of A. alternata strain THJ infection of Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) and Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf), the qPCR results of seven consecutive time periods can truly reveal the changes in the expression levels of candidate genes in resistant and susceptible varieties. Therefore, we mainly use qPCR results. These results support a potential role for these genes as mediators of citrus ABS resistance. 3.4 Characterization of the role of identified candidate genes in citrus ABS resistance A VIGS approach was next utilized to explore the roles that these six candidate genes play in citrus ABS resistance by constructing individual recombinant pTRV2 vectors for each of these genes that were subsequently used for co-infection along with the pTRV1 vector. At 4 weeks post-infection, no differences were noted between the phenotypes of the control and VIGS plants. The specific bands of wild plant identified by TRV1 and TRV2 specific primers could not be amplified, and the specific bands of 200 bp could be identified successfully for Agrobacterium infection. However, qPCR validation confirmed the successful downregulation of all 6 of these genes in the respective VIGS plants relative to controls. Following the fungal inoculation of isolated leaves from these plants, lesion diameters were measured after 2 days, revealing that the average lesion diameter in pTRV2-CG053 silenced plants was increased, whereas the average lesion diameter in pTRV2-CG089 and pTRV2-CG105 silenced plants was significant decreased relative to controls, and no significant differences in lesion size were observed when comparing the pTRV2-CG090, pTRV2-GC101, and pTRV2-CG124 silenced plants to controls ( Fig. 6 ). This suggests that CG053, CG089, and CG105 represent promising candidate genes that may be related to citrus ABS resistance. 4 Discussion Breeding for resistant citrus varieties has gradually emerged as the most effective approach to persistently preventing and controlling the spread of citrus ABS disease. In prior studies, mandarins and hybrid citrus varieties have been shown to be particularly sensitive to ABS disease, whereas lemons, grapefruits, and sweet oranges are far more resistant. Environmental factors such as a Mediterranean or tropical climate can also contribute to greater citrus sensitivity to citrus ABS. The evaluation of disease-resistant citrus germplasm resources can aid in the identification of varieties with superior resistance, providing a theoretical foundation for the selective breeding of more resistant varieties [ 9 , 28–30 ]. Indoor analyses of disease resistance provide one means of evaluating disease resistance under more controlled conditions by excluding the impact of environmental variables on disease phenotypes and ensuring that the utilized samples and pathogen inoculation conditions are uniform. For the present study, 184 mandarin germplasms were assessed for ABS resistance under laboratory conditions. This method, however, is subject to certain limitations. For one, disease symptoms are generally more severe on detached leaves that have been inoculated as compared to infections in vivo [ 7 ]. There are also inherent limits to the use of just one fungal strain when assessing disease resistance, given that particular strains may exhibit greater pathogenicity when infecting certain varieties of citrus plants. The THJ strain used to conduct the present study exhibits a high degree of toxicity to maximize the reliability of these efforts to characterize disease resistance. As many different factors affect the development of ABS disease under field conditions, a three-year field survey of 12 citrus varieties was also conducted based on the results of initial indoor analyses. The field monitoring data were basically consistent in 2021–2022. At the same time, due to the extreme hot weather from August to October 2022 in this region, the disease incidence was relatively light during the investigation of spring tip leaves in 2023. So the field disease index of 12 citrus varieties monitored in 2023 was significantly different from the data in 2021–2022. However, the results of these three field surveys yielded can also verify the reliability of the indoor analysis method. We extracted 112,768 high-quality SNPs from 184 mandarin germplasms from a previous genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) study of 240 mandarin germplasms. Population structure and evolutionary characterization of 184 mandarin germplasms were obtained through Wang et al. [ 27 ] and complied with GWAS analysis. Here, a GWAS approach was thus used to identify citrus ABS resistance-related genes. In total, 36 SNPs significantly associated with resistance were identified in the 9336217 and 36633265 genomic regions of chromosome 3 in the Clementina reference genome. In line with these results, a prior diploid fine-mapping study focused on citrus ABS resistance also mapped a locus between bases 2596094 and 25862085 on chromosome 3 [ 10 ], partially overlapping with the abovementioned resistance region, albeit without the mapping of the same significant resistance-related SNPs. Further candidate gene analyses revealed that CG093 (CICLE_10021676m) at A3_24838146, CG097 (CICLE_v10022372m) at A3_24942210, and CG101 (CICLE_v10023902m) and CG102 (CICLE_v10024232m) at A3_24997361 were all included in prior sequencing fragments. These results support partial overlap between the resistance-related loci identified in this study and those reported previously, emphasizing the suitability of this population of 184 mandarin germplasms for use when identifying significant SNPs associated with ABS resistance. These significant SNPs did not overlap with previous reports for chromosome 3, suggesting that this may correspond to a novel resistance locus. In trait-SNP association analyses, the significant SNPs were found to be primarily concentrated on chromosome 3, suggesting that this is the primary locus for ABS resistance heritability. Comparative genomic analyses have revealed that hundreds of NBS-LRR genes are often encoded in clusters within the genomes of particular plants [ 31 , 32 ]. Physical or genetic mapping efforts often reveal clusters of resistance genes [ 33 ]. Consistently, the chromosome 3 resistance locus identified in the present study was found to encode multiple NB-LRR genes, with 9 resistance genes within the analyzed 16–30 Mb region of this chromosome. We selected Miyagawa wase unshiu ( Citrus unshiu Macf) variety and the Chengtuo hongju ( Citrus tangerine hort. ex Tanaka) variety, which are representative and widely cultivated in southwest China, and evaluated the transcriptomic analyses of ABS response. In total, 104 disease resistance protein families were identified on chromosome 3 ( Supplementary Table 7 ), including 76 TIR-NBS-LRR genes, 10 genes encoding proteins with NB-ARC domains, 9 encoding proteins with NB-ARC and LRR domains, and 9 encoding LRR-like protein kinase family proteins ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The TIR-NBS-LRR resistance proteins were the most highly expressed targets on chromosome 3, suggesting that they may correspond to the primary candidate genes that confer ABS resistance. A range of resistance proteins have been cloned from different plant species, including members of the NB-LRR and LRR protein kinase families. NB-LRR proteins can be further classified based on their N-terminal structures into TIR-NBS-LRR and CC-NBS-LRR resistance proteins. The recognition of pathogens by plants can occur through both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms, the latter of which is mediated by receptor proteins or receptor kinases on the cell surface [ 34 ]. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors within cells can additionally detect any effector molecules that are transferred into cells. TIR domain activity can facilitate resistance-related signal transduction and specific pathogen recognition. Proteins with a TIR structure can tetramerize and catalyze NAD + hydrolysis, mediating downstream immune-related signal transduction and controlling cellular death [ 35 , 36 ]. NBS domain binding to ADP or ATP can influence the conformational characteristics of disease resistance proteins and thereby shape downstream disease resistance signaling. LRR domains can direct or indirectly interact with pathogen-associated proteins to facilitate the specific detection of these pathogens. Effector-mediated resistance protein activation can then induce various protective responses such as the rapid release of high reactive oxygen species levels that contribute to allergic necrosis [ 37 ]. NB-LRR proteins are capable of directly binding to pathogen-associated effectors, or indirectly recognizing these effectors through interactions with resistance protein co-factors that recognize or modify these effectors [ 38 ]. The rice NB-LRR proteins RGA4 and RGA5 have been reported to directly bind and recognize the effectors AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia [ 39 ]. The TIR domain of the Nicotiana benthamiana ROQ3 resistance protein can also directly interact with the Xanthomonas euvesicatoria effector XopQ, resulting in the generation of a tetrameric structure that can initiate downstream immune-related signaling [ 40 ]. The Arabidopsis TIR-NBS-LRR resistance protein RPP1 associates with the ATR1 effector protein in the context of Peronospora parasitism via its LRR domain, whereupon its TIR domain can induce hypersensitive cellular necrosis [ 41 ]. The TIR domain of the TIR-NBS-LRR resistance protein CSA1 can also drive accelerated cellular necrosis and influence the invasivity of certain pathogens [ 42 ]. Plant leucine-rich receptor kinase proteins can detect a range of extracellular pathogen-associated peptides [ 43 ], as in the case of the tomato FLS3 protein that is capable of binding to FLS2-28 receptors to enhance immune response induction [ 44 ]. Based on the results of previous studies, the research speculated that TIR-NBS-LRR disease resistance proteins CG053 and CG089 and LRR-Pkinase protein CG105 may rapidly recognize pathogen effect factors that break through PTI immunity through TIR domain or LRR domain, causing their own protein conformation changes. Activate the NBS nucleotide binding domain, transmit immune signals downstream, and initiate the ETI immune defense response of plants. The specific defense mechanism involved and the downstream immune response caused by them still need further research. In conclusion, a VIGS approach in the present study revealed that the CG053 and CG089 genes encoding homologs of Arabidopsis TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and the CG105 gene encoding a homolog of an Arabidopsis LRR-Pkinase protein were associated with ABS disease resistance. The molecular mechanisms through which these genes contribute to such resistance and related downstream signaling pathways, however, remain to be evaluated in future studies. 5 Conclusions In conclusion, we evaluated the disease resistance of 184 mandarins to ABS disease, and 129 candidate genes significantly associated with citrus resistance to ABS disease were searched at 37 significant SNPs. Transcriptome sequencing identified 28 candidate genes for differential expression, and 3 new NLRs anti-brown spot genes were further identified by VIGS. This study shed light on the genetic basis of citrus ABS resistance, which provided a helpful tool for marker-assisted selection and genetic improvement of A. alternata in citrus, and provided a research premise for the research on the mechanism of citrus ABS resistance.
