    "full_text": "Much effort has been made on the dissection of cold response in citrus, but relevant study in wild germplasm has been rare. Based on the result of the membership function value analysis with 12 physiological indexes, we reported a wild citrus germplasm, Chongyi wild mandarin ( Citrus reticulata ), which was more cold-tolerant than a cold-hardy rootstock, Poncirus trifoliata . To gain an overview of transcriptome changes under cold, leaves of Chongyi wild mandarin were sampled at 0, 1, 5 d after 0 °C treatment, and sequenced using an Illumina sequencing platform. Totally, 3921 and 5995 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 1 d and 5 d, respectively. And then, RNA-seq results were further validated via real-time quantitative PCR with 17 DEGs. Many DEGs related to various cold signaling pathways were identified, especially those related to brassinosteroid cascade. Around 10 % of the total DEGs were transcription factors from 67 families, suggesting that transcriptional regulation, both C-repeat/dehydration responsive element-binding factor-dependent/independent pathways, was crucial for the cold tolerance of Chongyi wild mandarin. Our data also revealed that the transcriptional levels of many DEGs related to anti-oxidant enzymes and osmoprotectants metabolism were altered, which were consistent with the results of physiological experiments. Moreover, a number of DEGs involved in ABA, BR, GA metabolisms were isolated. Accordingly, the levels of ABA and BR were significantly increased under cold, but GAs were decreased. Taken together, this work provided a comprehensive view of physiological and transcriptional alterations in cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin."

          "Low temperature, either chilling (0–15 °C) or freezing (< 0 °C), is one of the major stressors limiting plant growth, development, yield and geographic distribution ( Ji et al., 2019 ). A period of exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures could increase the tolerance of various temperate plants to subsequent freezing temperatures, which was defined as the process of cold acclimation ( Thomashow, 1999 ). Besides decreasing temperature, the initiation of cold acclimation also needs decreasing photoperiod and changes in light quality ( Chang et al., 2021 ). To date, many researches have been done and tremendous progresses have been made in dissecting the mechanism of cold acclimation and cold tolerance in plants ( Baier et al., 2019 ; Ming et al., 2020 ; Prerostova et al., 2021 ). Cold-induced changes in membrane fluidity and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton might trigger the Ca 2+ influx, which initiated the signal perception involving receptors such as calmodulin, Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinases (CPKs) and calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinase 3 (CIPK3) ( Kudla et al., 2018 ). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPKs) cascades and phytohormones, like abscisic acid (ABA), brassinosteroids (BRs), played important roles in the following cold signal transduction process ( Li et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2020 ). Subsequently, an array of transcription factors (TFs) was activated and they regulated the expression of downstream cold regulated ( COR ) genes ( Liu et al., 2014 ).",
          "C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) play important roles in the cold-responsive pathway, which is also known as the dehydration-responsive element-binding factors (DREBs) and belonged to the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor-type transcription factor family ( Fowler and Thomashow, 2002 ). CBFs can regulate the expression of a subset of COR genes encoding functional proteins like low-molecular-weight compatible osmolytes and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging proteins ( Peng et al., 2014 ; Lv et al., 2020 ). The expression of CBFs was regulated by some upstream transcription factors, including inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1), MdBBX37, MdMYB88/MdMYB124, zinc finger of Arabidopsis thaliana 12 (ZAT12), ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3), brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1) and calmodulin binding transcription activators (CAMTA) ( An et al., 2020 ; Doherty et al., 2009 ; Fowler et al., 2005 ; Huang et al., 2015 ; Kim et al., 2013 ; Li et al., 2017 ; Shi et al., 2012 ; Xie et al., 2018 ). On the post-translational level, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase cold-responsive protein kinase 1 (CRPK1) can phosphorylate 14-3-3 proteins and facilitate their binding with CBFs, leading to the proteasome-mediated degradation of CBFs ( Liu et al., 2017 ). In addition, some CBF-independent genes were also reported, such as high expression of osmotically responsive gene 9 , WKRY6 , suppressor of overexpression of constans 1 ( SOC1 ) ( Zhu et al., 2004 ). Most of the above-mentioned investigations were done in Arabidopsis , while the cold responsive mechanism in non-model woody plants was less explored, especially in wild germplasms.",
          "Citrus originated in Southeast Asia and spread worldwide with human activities, which has been one of the most economically important fruit crops ( Liu, 1983 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ). China is considered as one of the centers of origin for the genus Citrus L. and rich in wild citrus germplasms, such as Ichang papeda ( C. ichangensis ), Hongkong kumquat ( Fortunella hindsii ), precocious trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata ), C. junos Sieb. ex Tanaka ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). Wild mandarins were mostly distributed in a region around the Nanling Mountains in the south of China, such as Mangshan Mountain, Daoxian and Jiangyong Counties in Hunan Province, Chongyi County in the south of Jiangxi Province and Hezhou in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region ( Nie and Hu, 1987 ; Li et al., 2007 ). Since commercial cultivars are vulnerable to various biotic and abiotic stresses due to the very narrow genetic diversity, wild germplasms have been considered as the ideal materials for genetic improvement of citrus ( Wu et al., 2014 ). Therefore, the assessment of these wild citrus species resistant to various stresses is of great significance.",
          "In 1977, a loose-skin mandarin (Citrus reticulata) was first discovered in the valleys of Chongyi County, locally called ‘Chou Gan’ in Chinese, meaning ‘smelly tangerine’ ( Luo, 1981 ). But its evaluation and utilization has been rare. P. trifoliata was the commonly recognized citrus species with remarkable cold hardiness after a period of acclimation ( Peng et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Our preliminary experiments revealed that Chongyi wild mandarin had lower electrolyte leakage (EL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content than P. trifoliata did after cold treatment, indicating that it might be more cold-tolerant. Therefore, we validated the cold tolerance of Chongyi wild mandarin using the membership function value method and analyzed its transcriptomic alteration in response to cold stress, which may contribute to the genetic improvement of cold-tolerant citrus cultivars in future."

Raf.) and Chongyi wild mandarin ( Citrus reticulata Blanco) seedlings were collected in the nursery of National Navel Orange Engineering Research Center at Gannan Normal University. In late May, the 15–20 cm long shoots from the two plant materials were detached and placed in the ddH 2 O containing 0.1 % (w/v) NaCl to avoid freezing during 0 °C treatment. After being pre-cultured under ambient condition for 1 d, the detached shoots were placed in a 0 °C growth chamber (GXZ-0158-LED, Ningbo Jiangnan Instrument Factory, China). The leaves from both plant materials were sampled at the time points of 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 d, respectively. Samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 °C until use, but fresh leaves were used for the measurement of electrolyte leakage (EL). Only the leaves sampled at the time points of 0, 1, 5 d from Chongyi wild mandarin were used for RNA-seq analysis."

The 6DCS content was higher than CS and BL, and it increased dramatically upon cold treatment ( Fig. 8 a, P < 0.05). The CS content was relatively low and decreased on 1 d, but recovered on 5 d ( Fig. 8 b). While the BL content showed the opposite changes as CS did ( Fig. 8 c).

              "Phosphorylation is a primary event in cold perception and the commonest post-translational modification in response to cold stress ( Shi et al., 2018 ; Zhao et al., 2017 ). The significantly enriched GO terms in 5 d were all related to phosphorylation and modification ( Fig. 5 ). Several kinase families were suggested to participate in cold signaling, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPKs), Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinases (CPKs), calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinase 3 (CIPK3) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs) ( Lehti-Shiu and Shiu, 2012 ). Many these kinase-related DEGs were identified (Table S3), indicating that Chongyi wild mandarin may share the common cold signaling pathway as Arabidopsis.",
              "As the largest plant-specific clade of the eukaryotic receptor kinase superfamily ( Shiu and Bleecker, 2012 ), LRR-RLKs accounted for around 5% of the total DEGs identified in 1 d, so did in 5 d. Amazingly, 61 % of the LRR-RLKs were annotated as brassinosteroid insensitive 1 and its partner brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1, two plasma membrane-resident receptor kinase and the initiators of BR signaling pathway ( Ma et al., 2016 ). Thus, different from Arabidopsis, BR signaling might play a dominant role in cold perception and transduction of Chongyi wild mandarin. Consistent with the report that the BR cascade triggers the dephosphorylation and activation of two homologous transcription factors, brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1) and BZR1-EMS-suppressor 1 (BES1) in the nucleus ( Planas-Riverola et al., 2019 ), one DEG (Cs2g09750) encoding BZR1 homolog protein was up-regulated upon cold stress ( Fig. 8 b). After being phosphorylated by Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) and binding with 14-3-3 proteins, BZR1 degrades ( Peng et al., 2008 ). However, cold could induce the dephosphorylation of BZR1 and it can up-regulate CBFs in freezing treatment ( Li et al., 2017 ). Thus, cold tolerance was enhanced.",
              "ABA signaling is the key pathway controlling the response to abiotic stresses ( Peng et al., 2008 ). Under unfavorable environment, ABA receptor PYR1 phosphorylates SnRK, and the activated SnRK phosphorylates TFs such as ABI5, resulting in the regulation of various stress-responsive genes ( Yoshida et al., 2014 ). The transcriptional levels of PYR1 , SnRK and ABI5 as well as one gene encoding the key biosynthetic enzyme of ABA (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3, NCED3) were all up-regulated upon cold treatment ( Fig. 7 ), indicating that ABA signaling pathway also acts positively in cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin. However, there is an antagonistic relationship between BR and ABA signaling ( Planas-Riverola et al., 2019 ). BZR1, the positive factor in BR pathway, could suppress the expression of ABI5 directly ( Yang et al., 2016 ). BIN2, the negative factor in BR pathway, acted positively in ABA pathway by phosphorylating and activating SnRK and ABI5 ( Cai et al., 2014 ; Hu and Yu, 2014 ). But these works were done in seed germination and primary root elongation of Arabidopsis under ambient condition. In cold-challenged Chongyi wild mandarin, both the transcriptional levels of ABI5 and BZR1 were elevated ( Figs. 7 and 8 b, respectively), so were the contents of 6DCS, BL and ABA ( Fig. 9 a, c, h). Therefore, the ABA and BR pathways may work cooperatively, instead of antagonistically, in cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin."

In this work, totally 533 putative cold-responsive TFs have been identified as DEGs (Fig. S1), accounting for around 10 % of all DEGs. The number and proportion of differentially expressed TFs in Chongyi wild mandarin were much higher than that in cold-stressed P. trifoliata ( Wang et al., 2015 ). Although they were supposed to be triggered at the early stage of stress ( Liu et al., 2020 ), more TFs were identified as DEGs in 5 d than in 1 d. Therefore, transcriptional regulation may be an important and long-lasting regulatory system in cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin.",
              "The CBF cold response pathway has a prominent role in cold tolerance ( Shi et al., 2018 ). Many CBF regulon members were identified as DEGs ( Fig. 8 b), including CBF , its activators ICE1 , CAMTA3 , BZR1 ( Doherty et al., 2009 ; Huang et al., 2015 ; Li et al., 2017 ), and its repressors EIN3 , ZAT10 , ZAT12 , SOC1 as well as its downstream target COR413 ( Ji et al., 2019 ; Karimi et al., 2015 ; Seo et al., 2009 ; Shi et al., 2012 ; Vogel et al., 2005 ). However, multiple cold regulatory pathways may exist in Chongyi wild mandarin. Besides CBF-dependent pathway, BZR1 also functioned in CBF-independent manner in cold improvement of plant by the direct regulation of WRKY6 ( Li et al., 2017 ). The transcriptional levels of two WRKY6s were up-regulated in cold-stressed Chongyi wild mandarin ( Fig. 8 b). Therefore, CBF-dependent and CBF-independent pathways probably work in concert to improve the cold tolerance of Chongyi wild mandarin.",
              "However, CBFs -overexpressing lines did show increased cold tolerance but severe retardation in growth due to the decrease in bioactive GAs and the accumulation of DELLA ( Achard et al., 2008 ). In 1 d and 5 d, the expression levels of one CBF ( Fig. 8 b), the majority DEGs encoding GA oxidase (Table S4) and DELLA (Table S5) were increased, and the GAs’ contents were decreased ( Fig. 9 ), suggesting that DELLA-dependent growth repression caused by CBF pathway also existed in cold-stressed Chongyi wild mandarin. Since fighting against cold at the expense of growth arrest may compromise tolerance, a braking system is necessary to fine-tune the CBF pathway ( Shi et al., 2018 ).",
              "Because the transcriptional expression of BIN2 was not affected by cold ( Li et al., 2017 ), no BIN2 was identified as DEGs in this work. But BIN2 phosphorylates BZR1 regardless of temperature changes and negatively regulates the expression of CBFs as well as their target genes under cold ( Li et al., 2017 ). Moreover, three up-regulated DEGs encoding 14-3-3-like proteins were identified ( Fig. 8 b), which could also facilitate the proteasome-mediated degradation of CBFs ( Liu et al., 2017 ). Thus, BIN2 and 14-3-3 proteins, two negative members of BRs pathway, might contribute to brake the CBF pathway-caused dwarfism."

The plant has evolved a robust antioxidant system to cope with the ROS burst, including POD, SOD, CAT, APX, GPX, TPX ( Davletova et al., 2005 ; Mittler et al., 2006 ; Rizhsky et al., 2004 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Zuo et al., 2020 ).

However, comparing with P. trifoliata , Chongyi wild mandarin had higher ROS content and much lower SOD activities ( Fig. 2 ). It was reported that ROS is also a group of signaling-associated agents, which can mediate the retrograde signaling from chloroplast to nucleus and participate in various plant physiological processes, such as acclimation and resistance ( Kim, 2020 ; Meskauskiene et al., 2001 ). In addition, stresses can trigger ROS-induced ROS production, a cell-to-cell process termed as ROS wave, which initiates stress signals to the whole plant ( Fichman et al., 2019 , 2020 ).

In plants, soluble sugars, such as sucrose, glucose and fructose, function both as energy source and osmoprotectants ( Wei et al., 2019 ). Starch is hydrolyzed into glucose, maltose and other carbohydrate products via amylase ( Peng et al., 2014 ). Sucrose is irreversibly degraded into fructose and glucose by invertase (INV) ( Dahro et al., 2016 ). Intercellular transport of sugars is dependent on various sugar transporters (SUTs), such as ERD6-like and SWEET, SUC, UDP-sugar transporter ( Chen et al., 2011 ; Misra et al., 2019 ). The majority of the identified SUTs along with eight INVs and 13 out of 17 amylase were transcriptionally up-regulated ( Fig. 10 ). LEAs and proline are the other two well-known osmoprotectants ( Liu et al., 2020 ; Zulfiqar et al., 2020 ). The transcriptional levels of 84 % of the DEGs encoding LEAs and five proline-related DEGs were significantly increased ( Fig. 10 ).

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Low temperature, either chilling (0–15 °C) or freezing (< 0 °C), is one of the major stressors limiting plant growth, development, yield and geographic distribution ( Ji et al., 2019 ). A period of exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures could increase the tolerance of various temperate plants to subsequent freezing temperatures, which was defined as the process of cold acclimation ( Thomashow, 1999 ). Besides decreasing temperature, the initiation of cold acclimation also needs decreasing photoperiod and changes in light quality ( Chang et al., 2021 ). To date, many researches have been done and tremendous progresses have been made in dissecting the mechanism of cold acclimation and cold tolerance in plants ( Baier et al., 2019 ; Ming et al., 2020 ; Prerostova et al., 2021 ). Cold-induced changes in membrane fluidity and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton might trigger the Ca 2+ influx, which initiated the signal perception involving receptors such as calmodulin, Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinases (CPKs) and calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinase 3 (CIPK3) ( Kudla et al., 2018 ). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPKs) cascades and phytohormones, like abscisic acid (ABA), brassinosteroids (BRs), played important roles in the following cold signal transduction process ( Li et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2020 ). Subsequently, an array of transcription factors (TFs) was activated and they regulated the expression of downstream cold regulated ( COR ) genes ( Liu et al., 2014 ). C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) play important roles in the cold-responsive pathway, which is also known as the dehydration-responsive element-binding factors (DREBs) and belonged to the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor-type transcription factor family ( Fowler and Thomashow, 2002 ). CBFs can regulate the expression of a subset of COR genes encoding functional proteins like low-molecular-weight compatible osmolytes and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging proteins ( Peng et al., 2014 ; Lv et al., 2020 ). The expression of CBFs was regulated by some upstream transcription factors, including inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1), MdBBX37, MdMYB88/MdMYB124, zinc finger of Arabidopsis thaliana 12 (ZAT12), ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3), brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1) and calmodulin binding transcription activators (CAMTA) ( An et al., 2020 ; Doherty et al., 2009 ; Fowler et al., 2005 ; Huang et al., 2015 ; Kim et al., 2013 ; Li et al., 2017 ; Shi et al., 2012 ; Xie et al., 2018 ). On the post-translational level, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase cold-responsive protein kinase 1 (CRPK1) can phosphorylate 14-3-3 proteins and facilitate their binding with CBFs, leading to the proteasome-mediated degradation of CBFs ( Liu et al., 2017 ). In addition, some CBF-independent genes were also reported, such as high expression of osmotically responsive gene 9 , WKRY6 , suppressor of overexpression of constans 1 ( SOC1 ) ( Zhu et al., 2004 ). Most of the above-mentioned investigations were done in Arabidopsis , while the cold responsive mechanism in non-model woody plants was less explored, especially in wild germplasms. Citrus originated in Southeast Asia and spread worldwide with human activities, which has been one of the most economically important fruit crops ( Liu, 1983 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ). China is considered as one of the centers of origin for the genus Citrus L. and rich in wild citrus germplasms, such as Ichang papeda ( C. ichangensis ), Hongkong kumquat ( Fortunella hindsii ), precocious trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata ), C. junos Sieb. ex Tanaka ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). Wild mandarins were mostly distributed in a region around the Nanling Mountains in the south of China, such as Mangshan Mountain, Daoxian and Jiangyong Counties in Hunan Province, Chongyi County in the south of Jiangxi Province and Hezhou in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region ( Nie and Hu, 1987 ; Li et al., 2007 ). Since commercial cultivars are vulnerable to various biotic and abiotic stresses due to the very narrow genetic diversity, wild germplasms have been considered as the ideal materials for genetic improvement of citrus ( Wu et al., 2014 ). Therefore, the assessment of these wild citrus species resistant to various stresses is of great significance. In 1977, a loose-skin mandarin (Citrus reticulata) was first discovered in the valleys of Chongyi County, locally called ‘Chou Gan’ in Chinese, meaning ‘smelly tangerine’ ( Luo, 1981 ). But its evaluation and utilization has been rare. P. trifoliata was the commonly recognized citrus species with remarkable cold hardiness after a period of acclimation ( Peng et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Our preliminary experiments revealed that Chongyi wild mandarin had lower electrolyte leakage (EL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content than P. trifoliata did after cold treatment, indicating that it might be more cold-tolerant. Therefore, we validated the cold tolerance of Chongyi wild mandarin using the membership function value method and analyzed its transcriptomic alteration in response to cold stress, which may contribute to the genetic improvement of cold-tolerant citrus cultivars in future. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials and cold treatment Two-year-old trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.) and Chongyi wild mandarin ( Citrus reticulata Blanco) seedlings were collected in the nursery of National Navel Orange Engineering Research Center at Gannan Normal University. In late May, the 15–20 cm long shoots from the two plant materials were detached and placed in the ddH 2 O containing 0.1 % (w/v) NaCl to avoid freezing during 0 °C treatment. After being pre-cultured under ambient condition for 1 d, the detached shoots were placed in a 0 °C growth chamber (GXZ-0158-LED, Ningbo Jiangnan Instrument Factory, China). The leaves from both plant materials were sampled at the time points of 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 d, respectively. Samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 °C until use, but fresh leaves were used for the measurement of electrolyte leakage (EL). Only the leaves sampled at the time points of 0, 1, 5 d from Chongyi wild mandarin were used for RNA-seq analysis. 2.2 Measurement of EL and malondialdehyde (MDA) content As the two well-known indexes for the cell membrane damages evaluation, EL and MDA content were measured according to Wang et al. (2019) . Briefly, as to EL, fresh leaves sampled at different time points were placed in a tube containing 10 mL of ddH 2 O, and a tube without leaves was used as the control. After shaking on the ZD-85A shaker (Kexi, China) at 30 r min −1 under room temperature for 2 h, EL of sample (C 1 ) and control (CK 1 ) was measured with the DSS-307 conductivity meter (SPSIC, China). After boiling for 20 min and completely cooling down, C 2 and CK 2 were measured. A relative conductance (C) was calculated according to the equation C (%) = (C 1 -CK 1 ) / (C 2 -CK 2 ) × 100. As to MDA content, samples were homogenized in 5% (w/v) trichloroaceticic acid, and then centrifuged at 10,000 r min −1 for 10 min. A 2 mL aliquot of the supernatant was taken and mixed with 2.0 mL of 0.67 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid. The mixture was boiled at 100 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 r min −1 for 5 min after cooling down. The supernatant was used for assessing absorbance at 450, 532, and 600 nm with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600, Japan). MDA content = 6.45 (A 532 –A 600 )–0.56 A 450 , which was expressed as mmol g −1 . 2.3 Measurements of enzyme activities, anti-O 2 .− capacity and contents of sugars, H 2 O 2 , proline The activities of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and anti-O 2 .− capacity as well as the contents of soluble sugar, H 2 O 2 , proline were measured using corresponding assay kits according to the manufacturers’ instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The contents of sucrose, fructose and glucose were determined with a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. Briefly, 0.2 g leaf sample was mixed with 80 % ethanol and incubated at 80 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 4000 r min -1 for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and the precipitant was mixed with 80 % ethanol, followed by the same extraction process twice. The final supernatant was used as reaction substrate for the measurements of sucrose, fructose and glucose, respectively. The contents of all the tested sugars were shown as mg per g fresh weight. The activity of POD, SOD, CAT and anti-O 2 .− were indicated as unit (U) per g fresh weight. The content of H 2 O 2 and proline were shown as mmol per g fresh weight and μg per mL extract, respectively. 2.4 Statistical analysis of the physiological indexes The data were shown as means ± standard errors ( n = 3) and analyzed via SAS (version 9.2, SAS Institution, USA). Statistical difference was compared by analysis of variance based on Duncan’s multiple range test at significance level of P <  0.05, P < 0.01 or P <  0.001. Cold tolerance was calculated using the membership function value (MFV) analysis according to Chen et al. (2012) . After Z-score normalization, the data of the above-mentioned 12 physiological indexes were processed by the following formulas: U ( Xi ) = ( Xi - Xmin )/( Xmax – Xmin ), for indicators positively correlated with cold tolerance: total soluble sugar, sucrose, fructose, glucose, proline, POD, SOD, CAT, anti-O 2 .− activity; U ( Xi ) = 1 – ( Xi - Xmin )/( Xmax – Xmin ), for indicators negatively correlated with cold tolerance: EL, MDA and H 2 O 2 , where i means a specific physiological index, U the MFV of each physiological index, Xi the normalized data, Xmin and Xmax the minimum and maximum values in each dataset, respectively. Comprehensive evaluation of cold tolerance was calculated according to the formula: Y = ∑ i = i n U Xi n , n = 12. The bigger Y value, the more tolerant the material. 2.5 RNA extraction, cDNA library construction and RNA-seq analysis Total RNA from the cold-treated leaves of Chongyi wild mandarin at 0, 1, 5 d was separately extracted using an RNAprep pure Plant Kit (Tiangen, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity of total RNA was evaluated with a NanoDrop™ OneC Microvolume UV–vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The concentration of total RNA was checked using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit with a Qubit® 3.0 Flurometer (Invitrogen, USA). In addition, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) was applied to detect the integrity of total RNA. cDNA library construction and RNA-seq were carried out by Novogene Co. Ltd (Beijing, China) on an Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 platform. The raw reads have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under the BioProject accession number of PRJNA623065. 2.6 Mapping, Gene ontology (GO) annotation and differential expression analysis Clean reads were obtained after removal of the reads containing adapter, more than 10 % ambiguous bases, or low quality reads with GLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.3. And then the trimmed data were mapped to the reference genome of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck. Go assignments were made using public databases, including non-redundant protein from NCBI, Swiss-Prot, GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) public databases. Gene expression levels were normalized with DESeq and calculated as expected number of reads per kilobase of transcript sequence per millions base pairs sequenced (RPKM) values. In multiple testing, Bonferroni-corrected P -values were used to control the false discovery rate. The threshold to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two samples were set as Corrected P -Value < 0.05 and absolute value of log 2 (Sample1/Sample2) > 1. 2.7 Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis Seventeen unigenes annotated to be cold related DEGs were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. The primers were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 software and listed in supplemental table S1. cDNA was reverse-transcribed using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each qRT-PCR reaction contained 10 μL of FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche, Switzerland), 1 μL of cDNA, 1 μL of Primer F (10 μM), 1 μL of Primer R (10 μM) and 7 μL of ddH 2 O. The qRT-PCR reactions were performed with a Light Cycler® 96 Real-Time PCR (Roche) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min; 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 10 s; 95 °C for 10 s; 65 °C min; 97 °C for 1 s. Relative gene expression level was calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt algorithm by normalizing to the expression of Actin , which was used as the reference gene. 2.8 Measurement of brassinosteroid (BR), Gibberellin (GA) and ABA For the measurement of endogenous phytohormone contents, the samples were rapidly ground to powder with liquid nitrogen and then dissolved in methanol. The contents of endogenous BRs, including 6-deoxocastasterone (6DCS), castasterone (CS) and brassinolide (BL) were determined by electrospray ionisation/high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-HPLC–MS/MS) (ProNetsBio, Wuhan, China), and the measure method referred to Xin et al. (2013) . 3 Results 3.1 Chongyi wild mandarin showed less membrane damages than Poncirus trifoliata did Electrolyte leakage (EL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of the leaves from P. trifoliata and Chongyi wild mandarin after 0 °C treatment were measured and compared. As shown in Fig. 1 , EL and MDA contents were increasing as the treatment continued, and the two indexes of Chongyi wild mandarin at each sampling point were significantly lower than that of P. trifoliata ( P <  0.05/0.01/0.001). In addition, compared with the sharp elevation of EL in P. trifoliata after 3 d, EL in Chongyi wild mandarin increased slowly from 0 to 7 d ( Fig. 1 a). MDA content in P. trifoliata was significantly higher than that in Chongyi wild mandarin at the onset of cold treatment ( P <  0.001, Fig. 1 b). 3.2 Low temperature-treated Chongyi wild mandarin accumulated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) and osmoprotectants compared with P. trifoliata The contents of H 2 O 2 and O 2 .− (indicated by anti-O 2 .− capacity: the lower the capacity, the higher content of O 2 .− , vice versa) as well as the enzyme activities of peroxidases (POD), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. As shown in Fig. 2 a and b, the increasing trend of ROS in both plants were similar, but Chongyi wild mandarin had significantly higher contents of O 2 .− ( P <  0.05) and H 2 O 2 at 0 d ( P <  0.001), and it had tremendously more ROS accumulation throughout the treatment ( P <  0.05/0.01/0.001). As to the ROS-scavenging enzymes, low temperature stimulated the activity of POD and CAT at 1 d, and their changes were similar ( Fig. 2 c and d). The activity of SOD was significantly lower in Chongyi wild mandarin from 0 d to 7 d ( Fig. 2 e, P <  0.05/0.01/0.001). These data suggested that Chongyi wild mandarin could tolerate high concentration of ROS or ROS may play positive roles in the cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin. The contents of osmoprotectants, including proline, soluble sugars, sucrose, fructose and glucose in Chongyi wild mandarin continually increased from 0 d to 7 d ( Fig. 3 ). Although proline content was significantly higher in P. trifoliata at 0 d and 1 d, the increase in Chongyi wild mandarin was profounder and the content surpassed that in P. trifoliata after 3 d ( Fig. 3 a). More importantly, sugar contents were significantly higher in Chongyi wild mandarin at every time point ( Fig. 3 b–e, P <  0.001), suggesting that higher sugar content may greatly contribute to its cold tolerance. 3.3 Chongyi wild mandarin was more cold-tolerant than P. trifoliata based on membership function value (MFV) analysis All the tested 12 physiological indexes were used for MFV analysis to compare the cold tolerance between Chongyi wild mandarin and P. trifoliata , including contents of total soluble sugar, sucrose, fructose, glucose, H 2 O 2 , proline and activities of POD, SOD, CAT, anti-O 2 . − . As shown in Table 1 , the value of comprehensive evaluation index Y was constantly higher in Chongyi wild mandarin than in P. trifoliata at every sampling point, and the difference increased as the treatment prolonged. Collectively, these results suggested that Chongyi wild mandarin was more cold-tolerant than P. trifoliata . Therefore, RNA-seq was applied to identify cold responsive genes and pathways in Chongyi wild mandarin. 3.4 RNA-seq analysis and selection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) As shown in Table 2 , 6.49–7.83 G clean reads were obtained after sequence trimming. Quality evaluation that the Q30 values of the data were all over 93 %, with an average of 44.1 % GC content. Total mapped reads accounted for 86.5%–89.39% of the clean reads, indicating that C. sinensis was the suitable genome reference for Chongyi wild mandarin. Comparing with 0 d, there were totally 3921 (1885 up-regulated and 2036 down-regulated) and 5995 DEGs (3141 up-regulated and 2854 down-regulated) were identified in 1 d and 5 d, respectively ( Fig. 4 ). However, there were only 50 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated DEGs in 1 d vs 5 d dataset ( Fig. 4 ). 3.5 Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG classification of DEGs To analyze the putative functions of the DEGs, both GO and KEGG enrichment were performed. For GO classification, all the DEGs were annotated into three categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. Overall, 2867 and 4413 DEGs in 1 d vs 0 d and 5 d vs 0 d were annotated with GO terms, respectively. However, GO term in the cellular component category was significantly enriched in neither 1 d vs 0 d nor 5 d vs 0 d dataset (Corrected P -Value < 0.05, Fig. 5 ). As shown in Fig. 5 a, the most highly enriched GO terms in the biological process category of 1 d vs 0 d were metabolic process (1678 DEGs, accounting for 58.5 % of the total DEGs identified), oxidation-reduction process (353 DEGs, 12.3 %), carbohydrate metabolic process (190 DEGs, 6.6 %); the top three enriched GO terms in the molecular function category were catalytic activity (1616 DEGs, 56.4 %), oxidoreductase activity (364 DEGs, 12.7 %), cofactor binding (151 DEGs, 5.3 %). In 5 d vs 0 d, three GO terms in biological process related to modification were significantly enriched: cellular protein modification process, protein modification process, macromolecule modification; and four related to phosphorus/phosphorylation were significantly enriched: protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, phosphate-containing compound metabolic process, phosphorus metabolic process ( Fig. 5 b). But only two GO terms in the molecular function category were enriched: protein kinase activity and phosphotransferase activity ( Fig. 5 b). No KEGG pathway was significantly enriched when all the DEGs were analyzed (Corrected P -Value > 0.05). When only up- or down-regulated DEGs were used in KEGG classification, the following four pathways were significantly enriched in both 1 d vs 0 d and 5 d vs 0 d: galactose metabolism, photosynthesis, photosynthesis - antenna proteins, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (Table S1). 3.6 Verification of the RNA-seq results by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) To further verify RNA-seq results, qPCR analysis was performed using 17 selected DEGs. The primers used for qPCR were listed in Table S2. As shown in Fig. 6 , most of the selected genes’ expression patterns were highly consistent with the data obtained from the RNA-seq. Their correlation coefficient was about 0.7222, indicating that the data generated from RNA-seq analysis was reliable. 3.7 Identification of DEGs related to signaling & phytohormones and measurement of endogenous phytohormones in cold-stressed Chongyi wild mandarin Regulatory pathway mainly includes signal perception/transduction and post-translational modifications as well as TFs-mediated transcriptional regulation. In Table S3, 300 DEGs in 5 d vs 0 d were annotated as genes encoding LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinases (LRR-RLKs), out of which 125 were putative brassinosteroid insensitive 1 and 57 were brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 . Moreover, there were 35, 13, 13 identified DEGs encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPKs), Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinases (CPKs) and calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinase 3 (CIPK3), respectively (Table S3). Surprisingly, the transcriptional levels of 27 MPKs , 12 CPKs and 11 CIPK3s were significantly elevated by cold treatment. Three up-regulated CIPK3 were annotated as genes encoding SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK), which was an essential component in ABA signaling pathway. In addition, as the heatmap of DEGs related to ABA pathway shown in Fig. 7 , seven DEGs encoding putative protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), another important partner of ABA, were also identified. The transcriptional level of one ABA receptor, PYR1 , was up-regualted in 1 d but decreased sharply in 5 d. One 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3 ( NCED3 , Cs6g19500) encoding the key enzyme for ABA biosynthesis was up-regulated, but two NCED5 (Cs7g01700 and Cs7g14820) were down-regulated ( Fig. 7 ). Moreover, three ABA insensitive 5 ( ABI5 ) and four ABA 8′-hydroxylase were up-regulated ( Fig. 7 ). Besides the above-mentioned BR and ABA, Gibberellin (GA) and ethylene are also well-known stress-related phytohormones. There were 60 GA-related DEGs identified in 5 d (Table S4), out of which 11 were genes encoding DELLA protein (Table S5) and nine were up-regulated. Forty-four ethylene-related DEGs were identified in 5 d, but nearly all of them had been annotated as TFs. Subsequently, we measured the contents of endogenous BRs (6-deoxocastasterone, 6-DCS; castasterone, CS; brassinolide, BL), bioactive GAs (GA1, 3, 4, 7) and ABA. The 6DCS content was higher than CS and BL, and it increased dramatically upon cold treatment ( Fig. 8 a, P < 0.05). The CS content was relatively low and decreased on 1 d, but recovered on 5 d ( Fig. 8 b). While the BL content showed the opposite changes as CS did ( Fig. 8 c). The contents of GA1, 3, 4, 7 were all significantly decreased in cold-treated Chongyi wild mandarin ( Fig. 8 d–g, P < 0.05). In addition, the content of ABA showed no obvious difference between 0 d and 1 d, but increased greatly on 5 d ( Fig. 8 h). 3.8 Identification of DEGs related to transcriptionally regulatory pathways Totally, the transcript abundance of 533 putative TFs exhibited significantly changes in response to cold and their expression patterns were illustrated in Fig. S1. Compared with 0 d, 118 and 156 TFs were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated in 1 d, respectively. They may function in transcriptional regulation at the early stage of cold response (Corrected P -Value < 0.05). Notably, the transcriptional levels of 451 TFs were significantly changed in 5 d (Corrected P -Value < 0.05), which accounted for 85 % of the totally cold responsive TFs identified in Chongyi wild mandarin. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the largest TF family was MYB (51, 9.6 % of the total TFs), followed by NAC (36, 6.8 %), APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding proteins (AP2-EREBPs, 35, 6.6 %), bHLH (25, 4.7 %) and WRKY (24, 4.5 %). Eighteen AP2-EREBPs were annotated as DREBs, including one up-regulated CBF (Cs5g10240). Even though Cs2g14440 and Cs7g19780 shared 77 % identity in nucleotide sequence and both were identified as ICE1 , the transcriptional level of the former was significantly down-regulated and that of the later was up-regulated in the RNA-seq ( Fig. 9 b) as well as the qRT-PCR results ( Fig. 6 ). Many CBF-related genes were identified, including ZAT10 (Cs3g15900, Cs8g04280), ZAT12 (Cs8g17960), MAPK3 (Cs8g17360), CAMTA3 (Cs9g01510), EIN3 (Cs2g29100, Cs3g06930), BZR1 (Cs2g09750), COR413 (Cs5g28320), genes encoding 14-3-3-like proteins (Cs1g20220, Cs2g04850, Cs3g17990), low temperature-induced protein lt101.1 and lt101.2 (Cs6g01840, Cs6g01850), whose expression levels were universally up-regulated ( Fig. 8 b). Some members of the CBF-independent cold responsive pathway were also identified, such as WRKY6 (Cs2g02790, Cs7g04260) and SOC1 (Cs6g18260, Cs9g16575), whose transcriptional levels were also significantly increased upon cold ( Fig. 9 b). 3.9 Identification of DEGs related to ROS-scavenging enzymes and osmoprotectants Thirty-five DEGs involved in oxidation-reduction process were selected and their expression patterns were illustrated in Fig. 10 a, including genes encoding 28 peroxidases (PODs), one ascorbate peroxidases (APX), one glutathione peroxidase (GPX), two thioredoxin peroxidases (TPX) and three superoxide dismutases (SODs). Their expression levels were not universally up/down-regulated upon low temperature ( Fig. 10 a). For example, 18 PODs were up-regulated but 10 were down-regulated, indicating that the antioxidant system of cold-challenged Chongyi wild mandarin was complicated. Carbohydrate metabolic process was the third largest category among the enriched GO classification in biological process ( Fig. 5 ). Therefore, the transcriptional changes of 42 sugar-related DEGs were illustrated in Fig. 10 b. The expression levels of eight DEGs encoding invertase (INV) were all significantly up-regulated upon low temperature ( Fig. 10 b). Totally, 17 DEGs encoding amylase were identified, of which 13 were up-regulated and 4 were down-regulated ( Fig. 10 b). Seventeen DEGs encoding sugar transporters (SUTs) were identified, including 10 early responsive to dehydration 6 (ERD6)-like protein, four the sugar will eventually be exported transporter (SWEET), one sucrose transporter (SUC) and two UDP-sugar transporters ( Fig. 10 b). Besides various sugars, late embryogenesis abundant protein (LEA) and proline are also renowned osmoprotectants involving in stress-provoked osmotic adjustment. The transcriptional levels of 19 LEA-related DEGs were shown in Fig. 10 c, with 16 up-regulated and three down-regulated. Five proline-related DEGs were all significantly up-regulated ( Fig. 10 d), including genes encode one delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), two delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH), one ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) and one proline dehydrogenase (PDH). 4 Discussion P. trifoliata was used as an ideal rootstock in Citrus industry and a cold-hardy material in fundamental research ( Dahro et al., 2016 ; Ming et al., 2020 ). In the present work, we reported a more cold-hardy wild citrus germplasm, Chongyi wild mandarin. Elucidation of its physiological and molecular mechanisms in response to cold will be of great significance. 4.1 Pathways involving in cold signaling Phosphorylation is a primary event in cold perception and the commonest post-translational modification in response to cold stress ( Shi et al., 2018 ; Zhao et al., 2017 ). The significantly enriched GO terms in 5 d were all related to phosphorylation and modification ( Fig. 5 ). Several kinase families were suggested to participate in cold signaling, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPKs), Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinases (CPKs), calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinase 3 (CIPK3) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs) ( Lehti-Shiu and Shiu, 2012 ). Many these kinase-related DEGs were identified (Table S3), indicating that Chongyi wild mandarin may share the common cold signaling pathway as Arabidopsis. As the largest plant-specific clade of the eukaryotic receptor kinase superfamily ( Shiu and Bleecker, 2012 ), LRR-RLKs accounted for around 5% of the total DEGs identified in 1 d, so did in 5 d. Amazingly, 61 % of the LRR-RLKs were annotated as brassinosteroid insensitive 1 and its partner brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1, two plasma membrane-resident receptor kinase and the initiators of BR signaling pathway ( Ma et al., 2016 ). Thus, different from Arabidopsis, BR signaling might play a dominant role in cold perception and transduction of Chongyi wild mandarin. Consistent with the report that the BR cascade triggers the dephosphorylation and activation of two homologous transcription factors, brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1) and BZR1-EMS-suppressor 1 (BES1) in the nucleus ( Planas-Riverola et al., 2019 ), one DEG (Cs2g09750) encoding BZR1 homolog protein was up-regulated upon cold stress ( Fig. 8 b). After being phosphorylated by Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) and binding with 14-3-3 proteins, BZR1 degrades ( Peng et al., 2008 ). However, cold could induce the dephosphorylation of BZR1 and it can up-regulate CBFs in freezing treatment ( Li et al., 2017 ). Thus, cold tolerance was enhanced. ABA signaling is the key pathway controlling the response to abiotic stresses ( Peng et al., 2008 ). Under unfavorable environment, ABA receptor PYR1 phosphorylates SnRK, and the activated SnRK phosphorylates TFs such as ABI5, resulting in the regulation of various stress-responsive genes ( Yoshida et al., 2014 ). The transcriptional levels of PYR1 , SnRK and ABI5 as well as one gene encoding the key biosynthetic enzyme of ABA (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3, NCED3) were all up-regulated upon cold treatment ( Fig. 7 ), indicating that ABA signaling pathway also acts positively in cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin. However, there is an antagonistic relationship between BR and ABA signaling ( Planas-Riverola et al., 2019 ). BZR1, the positive factor in BR pathway, could suppress the expression of ABI5 directly ( Yang et al., 2016 ). BIN2, the negative factor in BR pathway, acted positively in ABA pathway by phosphorylating and activating SnRK and ABI5 ( Cai et al., 2014 ; Hu and Yu, 2014 ). But these works were done in seed germination and primary root elongation of Arabidopsis under ambient condition. In cold-challenged Chongyi wild mandarin, both the transcriptional levels of ABI5 and BZR1 were elevated ( Figs. 7 and 8 b, respectively), so were the contents of 6DCS, BL and ABA ( Fig. 9 a, c, h). Therefore, the ABA and BR pathways may work cooperatively, instead of antagonistically, in cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin. 4.2 Transcriptionally regulatory pathways in cold response The involvement of TFs in various abiotic stresses have been frequently reported among different plant species ( Karimi et al., 2015 ; Sun et al., 2020 ; Vogel et al., 2005 ; Xie et al., 2018 ), including MYB, NAC, AP2-EREBPs, bHLH and WRKY ( Fig. 8 a). In this work, totally 533 putative cold-responsive TFs have been identified as DEGs (Fig. S1), accounting for around 10 % of all DEGs. The number and proportion of differentially expressed TFs in Chongyi wild mandarin were much higher than that in cold-stressed P. trifoliata ( Wang et al., 2015 ). Although they were supposed to be triggered at the early stage of stress ( Liu et al., 2020 ), more TFs were identified as DEGs in 5 d than in 1 d. Therefore, transcriptional regulation may be an important and long-lasting regulatory system in cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin. The CBF cold response pathway has a prominent role in cold tolerance ( Shi et al., 2018 ). Many CBF regulon members were identified as DEGs ( Fig. 8 b), including CBF , its activators ICE1 , CAMTA3 , BZR1 ( Doherty et al., 2009 ; Huang et al., 2015 ; Li et al., 2017 ), and its repressors EIN3 , ZAT10 , ZAT12 , SOC1 as well as its downstream target COR413 ( Ji et al., 2019 ; Karimi et al., 2015 ; Seo et al., 2009 ; Shi et al., 2012 ; Vogel et al., 2005 ). However, multiple cold regulatory pathways may exist in Chongyi wild mandarin. Besides CBF-dependent pathway, BZR1 also functioned in CBF-independent manner in cold improvement of plant by the direct regulation of WRKY6 ( Li et al., 2017 ). The transcriptional levels of two WRKY6s were up-regulated in cold-stressed Chongyi wild mandarin ( Fig. 8 b). Therefore, CBF-dependent and CBF-independent pathways probably work in concert to improve the cold tolerance of Chongyi wild mandarin. However, CBFs -overexpressing lines did show increased cold tolerance but severe retardation in growth due to the decrease in bioactive GAs and the accumulation of DELLA ( Achard et al., 2008 ). In 1 d and 5 d, the expression levels of one CBF ( Fig. 8 b), the majority DEGs encoding GA oxidase (Table S4) and DELLA (Table S5) were increased, and the GAs’ contents were decreased ( Fig. 9 ), suggesting that DELLA-dependent growth repression caused by CBF pathway also existed in cold-stressed Chongyi wild mandarin. Since fighting against cold at the expense of growth arrest may compromise tolerance, a braking system is necessary to fine-tune the CBF pathway ( Shi et al., 2018 ). Because the transcriptional expression of BIN2 was not affected by cold ( Li et al., 2017 ), no BIN2 was identified as DEGs in this work. But BIN2 phosphorylates BZR1 regardless of temperature changes and negatively regulates the expression of CBFs as well as their target genes under cold ( Li et al., 2017 ). Moreover, three up-regulated DEGs encoding 14-3-3-like proteins were identified ( Fig. 8 b), which could also facilitate the proteasome-mediated degradation of CBFs ( Liu et al., 2017 ). Thus, BIN2 and 14-3-3 proteins, two negative members of BRs pathway, might contribute to brake the CBF pathway-caused dwarfism. 4.3 High tolerance for reactive oxygen species (ROS) ROS like superoxide anion (O 2 − ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) have long been acknowledged as potent oxidizing agents, which are dramatically induced by stress and excessive accumulation may greatly influence cell integrity ( Davletova et al., 2005 ; Lv et al., 2020 ; Wei et al., 2019 ). The plant has evolved a robust antioxidant system to cope with the ROS burst, including POD, SOD, CAT, APX, GPX, TPX ( Davletova et al., 2005 ; Mittler et al., 2006 ; Rizhsky et al., 2004 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Zuo et al., 2020 ). Indeed, the majority of DEGs encoding ROS scavenging enzymes were up-regulated ( Fig. 10 a), and ROS levels as well as the activities of POD and CAT were increased in cold-treated Chongyi wild mandarin ( Fig. 2 ). Intuitively, ROS levels are negatively correlated to stress tolerance and the more tolerant plant would have a stronger antioxidant system. However, comparing with P. trifoliata , Chongyi wild mandarin had higher ROS content and much lower SOD activities ( Fig. 2 ). It was reported that ROS is also a group of signaling-associated agents, which can mediate the retrograde signaling from chloroplast to nucleus and participate in various plant physiological processes, such as acclimation and resistance ( Kim, 2020 ; Meskauskiene et al., 2001 ). In addition, stresses can trigger ROS-induced ROS production, a cell-to-cell process termed as ROS wave, which initiates stress signals to the whole plant ( Fichman et al., 2019 , 2020 ). Therefore, Chongyi wild mandarin could tolerate a high level of ROS, which may function as signaling agents in cold response. 4.4 Profound accumulation of osmoprotectants Osmoprotectants are important for osmotic adjustment in unfavorable conditions ( Zulfiqar et al., 2020 ). In plants, soluble sugars, such as sucrose, glucose and fructose, function both as energy source and osmoprotectants ( Wei et al., 2019 ). Starch is hydrolyzed into glucose, maltose and other carbohydrate products via amylase ( Peng et al., 2014 ). Sucrose is irreversibly degraded into fructose and glucose by invertase (INV) ( Dahro et al., 2016 ). Intercellular transport of sugars is dependent on various sugar transporters (SUTs), such as ERD6-like and SWEET, SUC, UDP-sugar transporter ( Chen et al., 2011 ; Misra et al., 2019 ). The majority of the identified SUTs along with eight INVs and 13 out of 17 amylase were transcriptionally up-regulated ( Fig. 10 ). LEAs and proline are the other two well-known osmoprotectants ( Liu et al., 2020 ; Zulfiqar et al., 2020 ). The transcriptional levels of 84 % of the DEGs encoding LEAs and five proline-related DEGs were significantly increased ( Fig. 10 ). Meanwhile, the contents of sugars and proline were all dramatically enhanced in cold-stressed Chongyi wild mandarin ( Fig. 3 ). Therefore, the accumulation of a large quantity of osmoprotectants may remarkably contribute the cold tolerance of Chongyi wild mandarin. 5 Conclusion In summary, we demonstrated the physiological and transcriptional alterations of a cold-hardy citrus germplasm, Chongyi wild mandarin, in response to cold. A corresponding working model was proposed in Fig. 11 . Those common cold signaling pathways were triggered in Chongyi wild mandarin as in Arabidopsis and other plants, including Ca 2+ , MPKs, ABA, ethylene, but BR cascade probably played the dominant role. On the transcriptional level, a large quantity of TFs participated in the cold response of Chongyi wild mandarin, and both CBF-dependent/independent pathways were activated, which led to physiological changes like osmoprotectants accumulation and ROS scavenging. Thus, the cold tolerance of Chongyi wild mandarin was enhanced. The results proved the great potential of wild germplasm and revealed valuable insights into the cold responsive mechanisms of Chongyi wild mandarin.
