    "full_text": "Genetic engineering approaches offer an alternative method to the citrus canker resistance breeding. The ethylene response factor (ERF) family is a member of families of transcription factors that are particular to plants and contribute significantly to biotic stress response and to plant growth. CsAP2-09 belongs to the citrus AP2/ERF transcription factor family. Initially, we proved the induction of CsAP2-09 in wild-types by Xcc and some hormones involved in pathogen response. We successfully cloned the CsAP2-09 and proved that CsAP2-09 protein is targeted to the nucleus. The CsAP2-09 was functionally characterized with over-expression and RNAi silencing strategy. In the overexpression lines, the diseased lesions and disease index were significantly decreased while in RNAi lines of CsAP2-09 the diseased lesions and disease index were significantly enhanced. Thus, the over-expression conferred Xcc resistance to transgenic citrus while silencing of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange leads to Xcc susceptibility. When the transcriptomes of WT and overexpression transcriptomes were compared, they revealed that some genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, pathogen responses, transcript regulation etc. were modified. Our results provide a possibility for improving citrus canker disease resistance by over-expression of CsAP2s. Furthermore, various functions of CsAP2-09 provide significant information about the role of AP2/ERFs in plant disease resistance and stress tolerance."

          "Worldwide, citrus is an economically important fruit crop. A disease which requires quarantine is an important limiting factor commercially, especially in relation to exports of fresh fruit. Citrus canker disease is caused by quarantine pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) ( Schaad et al., 2005 ), and leads to heavy yield losses in all worldwide where citrus is grown. The citrus canker disease has always been controlled with a classical integrated approach, such as antibiotics or bactericides and eradication programs which are not economical. And these methods are not environmentally friendly and always induce risk to human health ( Brunings and Gabriel, 2003 ).",
          "It has been difficult to improve Citrus quality and productivity by traditional breeding techniques owing to its complex lifecycle, particularly the long juvenile period ( Gottwald et al., 2002 ). So, it is urgent to breed Xcc resistant varieties as a long-term measure to check citrus canker, because it is a very well-organized and economic approach. Genetic transformation is used as an alternative to the classical breeding approach ( Donmez et al., 2013 ). Molecular breeding is more efficient compared to the traditional cross-breeding. Currently, while several procedures for breeding strategies have been applied to produce cultivars that are resistant to diseases, the quickest method is genetic engineering, which consistently confers on the plant a single agronomic without affecting their phenotypes ( Singh and Rajam, 2009 ).",
          "In the plant genetic breeding, potential citrus canker-related genes should be the key factor in these breeding processes to produce transgenic citrus varieties. Transgenic citrus plants expressing genes that influence plant defense mechanisms have been produced and some of these lines have shown a significant improvement of resistance to diseases ( Fagoaga et al., 2001 ; Barbosa-Mendes et al., 2009 ; Distefano et al., 2008 ; Donmez et al., 2013 ). Among other strategies for improving the plant resistance to pathogens, a very effective method includes the introduction of transcription factors (TFs). These TFs code for proteins that participate in binding to the cis-acting element in gene promoter region to impact the expression of downstream genes confers stress responses in eukaryotes ( Yanagisawa, 2004 ; Mizoi et al., 2012 ; Rushton et al., 2012 ). There are several studies which report that transgenic plants with overexpressed TF genes had increased tolerance to several abiotic and biotic stresses ( Liu et al., 1998 ; Kasuga et al., 1999 ; Sakuma et al., 2002 ). The ethylene response factor (ERF), one of the TF genes that codes for TF proteins that are plant-specific, and belong to one of the biggest plant gene superfamilies, and its conserved AP2 (Apetala2)/ERF domains possess some common structures ( Mizoi et al., 2012 ). In this superfamily, AP2 family is characterized by two AP2 domains ( Sakuma et al., 2002 ). AP2 family has been isolated from various plant organisms, such as Citrus ( Ito et al., 2014 ; Xie et al., 2014 ), Populus trichocarpa ( Zhuang et al., 2008 ), Vitis vinifera ( Licausi et al., 2010 ), and Arabidopsis thaliana ( Nakano et al., 2006 ) etc.",
          "In the previous study by our team, one potential citrus canker-related AP2: CsAP2-09 was obtained from the RNAseq data, which was sequenced and compared the transcriptomes of sweet orange before and after Xcc infection. To study the relationship between citrus canker disease and CsAP2-09, this gene was functionally characterized with bioinformatics analysis and expression analysis including subcellular localization, over-expression and RNAi silencing, followed by RNAseq analysis of transgenic lines. Our results demonstrate that Xcc tolerance in transgenic Wanjincheng is significantly increased by the overexpression of CsAP2-09. This study may explain the role of CsAP2-09 in resistance to bacterial canker disease stress in citrus."

Total RNA was extracted from leaves of transgenic lines OE5, 6, 10 and WTs with RNasy Plant Mini Kit (AidLab, Beijing, China), and was shipped to the NOVOgene Inc. for cDNA library construction and sequencing on the IlluminaHiSeq2000TM platform. The three steps for construction of sequencing library were: (i) check the quality of RNA using Agilent Eukaryote Total RNA Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA); (ii) construction of library using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample PreKit (Illumina, San Diego, USA); (iii) quantitative analysis of library with QuantStudio 7 (Applied Biosystems, USA). After sequencing, the data were processed in four steps: (i) data filtering and removing surplus adaptors; (ii) map the short reads of high quality on the Citrus sinensis reference genome (Version 2, http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/orange/download/index.php ), sequenced, assembled and annotated by CAP ( Xu et al., 2013 ); (iii) assembly the transcript by TopHat software (version 2.0.9); and (iv) quantify the expression of genes (in fragments per kb transcript per million mapped reads or FPKM) using Cufflinks V2 ( Trapnell et al., 2012 ). A robust method that can be used for profiling gene expression is RNA-Seq, that elucidates the transgenic genes regulated molecules ( Liu et al., 2015 ). Here, detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was also done. For each gene, the fold change (FC) was expressed as the log transformation (base 2) of the FPKM specific value (transgenic line/wild-type). The gene is considered upregulated If FC > 1, and the gene is downregulated if FC < 1. To annotate the DEGs, Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment and pathway analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were conducted between WT and overexpression samples. To validate the transcriptomic data, qRT-PCR analysis of some DEGs were performed."

In the four subgroups, there are 3, 2, 4 and 3 CsAP2 genes, respectively (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 5A). CsAP2-09 is involved in subgroup IV which shares homology with other AP2s such as AT2G28550 of Arabidopsis thaliana ( Nakano et al., 2006 ), CsAP2-12 of Citrus sinensis ( Ito et al., 2014 ; Xie et al., 2014 ), GSVIVG01016352001 of Vitis vinifera ( Licausi et al., 2010 ) and Potri.008G045300 of Populus trichocarpa ( Zhuang et al., 2008 ) ( Fig. 1 A ; Supplementary Fig. 5A). The homologies were reported as TFs involved in biotic or abiotic responses. From the phylogenetic tree and the MEME results, we infer that AP2s in each group contain similar motifs style which indicate similar functions (Supplementary Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table 3). Base on the alignment of the 15 AP2s involved in group IV, two very conserved AP2 domains 1 and 2 can be detected ( Fig. 1 B). Based on all the 12 AP2s in Citrus sinensis , the two AP2 domains that make the core element of AP2s can also be detected which confer the AP2s the AP2 TF functions ( Fig. 1 C)."

              "In this study, CsAP2-09 could be induced by SA, MeJA and ET which indicates that CsAP2-09 should be involved in the disease resistance signaling pathway of SA, MeJA and ET pathways. The SA, MeJA pathways are always involved in biotic stress and the plant development."

              "To further investigate the functions of CsAP2-09 in Xcc resistance, we generated transgenic citrus lines. Confirmed by genomic PCR and Gus stain, six lines (OE1, OE3, OE5, OE6, OE8 and OE10) with the transgenic integration of CsAP2-09 were verified. The transgenic positives can be detected with 2 bands gel while the non-transgenic ones can only be observed 1 band from the original genome ( Fig. 5 A ). In the Gus stain, positives show the blue ( Fig. 5 B). Lines without the CsAP2-09 insertion were discarded and in remaining lines, and then qRT-PCR was carried out to analyze the mRNA production. The six transgenic lines with very high level of expression were considered to exhibit a relatively high expression level of CsAP2-09 compared with wild-type. Expression of CsAP2-09 in OE3 was the highest while OE1 was the lowest ( Fig. 5 C). Among the 6 OE-expression lines, OE1 and OE3 exhibited abnormal growth rate with a little larger size compared with WT ( Fig. 5 D).",
              "The canker resistance of the transgenic citrus lines was characterized by evaluating the six lines containing 35S:CsAP2-09 for their resistance to Xcc by inoculation through pin-pricking. The development of the disease was analyzed at 10 dpi. With the control (pinprick inoculation with LB medium instead of Xcc) ( Fig. 6 A1 ), in transgenic lines OE1, OE5, OE6, OE8, OE10 the rate pustule-eruption on the surface of the leaf significantly slower than that on the wild-type leaf. Hence, diseased lesions on the leaf of transgenic lines were notably smaller than those on the wild-type except OE3 ( Fig. 6 A2). These observations showed that over-expression of CsAP2-09 inhibited the pustule-development that was induced by Xcc infection. In OE3, there should be something changed. For example, the insertion of CsAP2-09 destroyed the insertion sites which are related to citrus canker. The larger size of OE3 maybe also explained as above. The insertion site may be an interesting point for a following research.",
              "On statistical evaluation, the diseased lesions on the six lines (OE1, OE5, OE6, OE8, OE10) were notably smaller compared to those on the wild-type. Thus, in the transgenic lines, the spread of the pathogen on the surface of the leaf was absolutely repressed ( Fig. 6 B). Correspondingly, on evaluating the disease index of the seven lines, their values were notably lower than that of the wild-type ( Fig. 6 C). There was a reduction by 19.3%–46.0% in the disease severity in these seven lines compared with the disease intensity of the wild-type. When these results were compared with those of the in vitro assay, these seven over-expressed lines showed robust and steady resistance to citrus canker, with the highest resistance in the line OE6 ( Fig. 6 B, C)."

              "The role of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange was further evaluated. For this, we knocked down the exogenous CsAP2-09 of sweet orange (Wanjincheng orange) using RNAi strategy. Selected with PCR verification, six RNAi mutant transgenic lines were obtained ( Fig. 7 A ) and with Gus stain verification the six putative positive lines were also detected as positive ( Fig. 7 B). Through qRT-PCR, five lines (R1, R2, R4, R5, R6) were shown to express a relatively low level of CsAP2-09 compared with WT line while CsAP2-09 expression in R3 was not silenced ( Fig. 7 C). Among the five RNAi-mutant lines, R1 exhibited abnormal growth rate with very smaller plant size compared with WT line which tells that the insertion of CsAP2-09 to the genome changed the normal phenotypes while R2, R4, R5 and R6 possess no phenotypic change ( Fig. 7 D).",
              "The five RNAi mutant lines were also evaluated for Xcc resistance by inoculation through pinprick. With the control (pinprick inoculation with LB medium instead of Xcc) ( Fig. 8 A1 ) transgenic lines R1, R2, R5 and R6 exhibited larger pustule eruptions on the leaf surface while R4 exhibited smaller pustule eruption of pustules. These observations showed that most of RNAi mutants of CsAP2-09 enhanced the sensibility of the Xcc infection, and line R5 and R6 showed the greatest propensity to develop canker ( Fig. 8 A2).",
              "After analyzing statistically, it was seen that diseased lesions in four lines (R1, R2, R5, and R6) were notably bigger than the lesions in the wild-type. The lesion area in those four lines was not significantly different from each other, thus, the expansion of the pathogen on the leaf surface was absolutely increased in RNAi transgenic lines ( Fig. 8 B). On estimating disease severity, it was seen that the disease index of R1, R2, R5 and R6 was notably higher than that compared to the wild-type ( Fig. 8 C). An enhancement by 0.5%–19.4% in disease index was seen in these lines compared with the wild-type disease index. The in vitro assay results reveal that silencing of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange leads to Xcc susceptibility which further elucidates the role of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange against Xcc."

To discern the changes in transcript levels of CsAP2-09 regulated genes, we carried out a comparative transcriptome analysis using leaves of OE5, OE6, OE10 (As three biological triplicates) and three WT controls (as biological triplicates). A total of 587 differently expressed gene (DEGs) were identified, of which 485 were upregulated and 102 were downregulated (Supplementary Fig. 7; Supplementary Tables S5, S6) total of 374 GO terms and 57 KEGG terms were enriched in the transcriptome of overexpression line (Supplementary Tables S7, S8). The top 30 GO terms (Supplementary Fig. 8A; Supplementary Fig. S6A) and KEGG pathways (Supplementary Fig. 8B; Supplementary Fig. S6B) were detailed. Overexpression of CsAP2-09 influenced multiple processes including pathogen defense response, transcription regulation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and so on ( Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 8B). To validate the RNAseq data, a supplementary qRT-PCR analysis was done on some DEGs (Primers see Supplementary Table S9). The transcriptomic data were validated by all the genes analyzed through qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Table S10). The comparative transcriptome analysis of OE-AP2-09 lines and WT plants reveal that there were changes in the expression of several genes involved in transcript regulation and pathogen response due to CsAP2-09 overexpression. Apart from this, some genes take part in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis also be influenced ( Table 1 ). These DEGs in the transgenic lines should be downstream genes which should work together to enhances the Xcc resistance in transgenic lines. The raw data of RNAseq project was submitted in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with an accession PRJNA505360."

The CsAP2-09 contains common motifs with AP2s from Arabidopsis, grape and Populus ( Nakano et al., 2006 ; Zhuang et al., 2008 ; Ito et al., 2014 ; Xie et al., 2014 ) ( Fig. 1 B). Based on all the AP2s in Citrus sinensis , the two AP2 domains that make the core element of AP2s can also be detected which confer the AP2s the AP2 TF functions ( Fig. 1 C). The homologies from other species were reported as TFs involved in biotic or abiotic responses. Based on the transient expression, CsAP2-09 appears to be a nuclear-localized protein which should be possible to regulate downstream genes as a transcription factor.",

In one aspect, the inducible expression indicated the involvements of CsAP2-09 in the signal pathways or in the citrus canker disease responses and tolerance. In other aspect, the Xcc induction also give light to the different functions of CsAP2-09 promotors in citrus canker sensitive cultivate and citrus canker resistant cultivate. It is the reason why the two cultivates possess different CsAP2-09 expression profiles which brought different citrus canker disease resistance. So, the promoters are worth further study to explore the functional differences between citrus canker resistant and sensitive varieties."

The CsAP2-09 belongs to the group IV of the AP2 family, is in the nucleus and induced by hormone and Xcc. Most of the transgenic plants were morphologically normal compared with the wild type, indicating that modification of the CsAP2-09 expression does not disrupt plant development. Evidence from RNA-Seq of transgenic plants indicates that overexpression of CsAP2-09 changes expression of genes involved in Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, Plant-pathogen interaction, Plant hormone signal transduction and some TFs. This study enriches people's understanding of the relationship between development and biotic stress in plant. Further research is in progress to study the co-expression proteins with pull-down strategy and targeted genes with Chip-seq strategy which will help to construct the molecular mechanism of CsAP2-09. In addition, the disease resistance of transgenic plants observed under controlled conditions must be confirmed in field trials."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Worldwide, citrus is an economically important fruit crop. A disease which requires quarantine is an important limiting factor commercially, especially in relation to exports of fresh fruit. Citrus canker disease is caused by quarantine pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) ( Schaad et al., 2005 ), and leads to heavy yield losses in all worldwide where citrus is grown. The citrus canker disease has always been controlled with a classical integrated approach, such as antibiotics or bactericides and eradication programs which are not economical. And these methods are not environmentally friendly and always induce risk to human health ( Brunings and Gabriel, 2003 ). It has been difficult to improve Citrus quality and productivity by traditional breeding techniques owing to its complex lifecycle, particularly the long juvenile period ( Gottwald et al., 2002 ). So, it is urgent to breed Xcc resistant varieties as a long-term measure to check citrus canker, because it is a very well-organized and economic approach. Genetic transformation is used as an alternative to the classical breeding approach ( Donmez et al., 2013 ). Molecular breeding is more efficient compared to the traditional cross-breeding. Currently, while several procedures for breeding strategies have been applied to produce cultivars that are resistant to diseases, the quickest method is genetic engineering, which consistently confers on the plant a single agronomic without affecting their phenotypes ( Singh and Rajam, 2009 ). In the plant genetic breeding, potential citrus canker-related genes should be the key factor in these breeding processes to produce transgenic citrus varieties. Transgenic citrus plants expressing genes that influence plant defense mechanisms have been produced and some of these lines have shown a significant improvement of resistance to diseases ( Fagoaga et al., 2001 ; Barbosa-Mendes et al., 2009 ; Distefano et al., 2008 ; Donmez et al., 2013 ). Among other strategies for improving the plant resistance to pathogens, a very effective method includes the introduction of transcription factors (TFs). These TFs code for proteins that participate in binding to the cis-acting element in gene promoter region to impact the expression of downstream genes confers stress responses in eukaryotes ( Yanagisawa, 2004 ; Mizoi et al., 2012 ; Rushton et al., 2012 ). There are several studies which report that transgenic plants with overexpressed TF genes had increased tolerance to several abiotic and biotic stresses ( Liu et al., 1998 ; Kasuga et al., 1999 ; Sakuma et al., 2002 ). The ethylene response factor (ERF), one of the TF genes that codes for TF proteins that are plant-specific, and belong to one of the biggest plant gene superfamilies, and its conserved AP2 (Apetala2)/ERF domains possess some common structures ( Mizoi et al., 2012 ). In this superfamily, AP2 family is characterized by two AP2 domains ( Sakuma et al., 2002 ). AP2 family has been isolated from various plant organisms, such as Citrus ( Ito et al., 2014 ; Xie et al., 2014 ), Populus trichocarpa ( Zhuang et al., 2008 ), Vitis vinifera ( Licausi et al., 2010 ), and Arabidopsis thaliana ( Nakano et al., 2006 ) etc. In the previous study by our team, one potential citrus canker-related AP2: CsAP2-09 was obtained from the RNAseq data, which was sequenced and compared the transcriptomes of sweet orange before and after Xcc infection. To study the relationship between citrus canker disease and CsAP2-09, this gene was functionally characterized with bioinformatics analysis and expression analysis including subcellular localization, over-expression and RNAi silencing, followed by RNAseq analysis of transgenic lines. Our results demonstrate that Xcc tolerance in transgenic Wanjincheng is significantly increased by the overexpression of CsAP2-09. This study may explain the role of CsAP2-09 in resistance to bacterial canker disease stress in citrus. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant and bacterial materials For functional analysis of CsAP2-09, Wanjincheng orange ( Citrus sinensis ) was selected for transgenic variation, wild-type of Calamondin ( Fortunella calamondin ) and Wanjincheng orange were collected for the expression profiling. Calamondin and Wanjincheng orange were planted in the National Citrus Germplasm Repository in Chongqing, China. All the transgenic and wild-type (WT) plants were grown and maintained in greenhouse with temperature maintained at 28 °C. XccYN1, a, Xcc type strain, was isolated from naturally infected leaves of sweet orange grown in an orchard in Yunnan province, China. All Xcc strains were cultured for 24 h at 28 °C in nutrient medium containing peptone, yeast extract, malt extract (PYM), with d ‑glucose at 1.5% (w/v) final concentration and the specified antibiotics. 2.2 Bioinformatics analysis of CsAP2s The genomic set and protein set were obtained from the CAP database (Citrus annotation project) ( Xu et al., 2013 ; Wang et al., 2014 ) respectively. Expert three-step procedure ( Fawal et al., 2014 ) was taken to annotate the AP2 family. Alignment of complete AP2 protein sequences of Citrus sinensis , Arabidopsis thaliana , Populus trichocarpa , and Vitis vinifera was done using Clustal W ( Chenna et al., 2003 ) and visually adjusted using BioEdit 7.2 ( Tippmann, 2004 ) and then a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree was constructed using Mega 7.0 with 1000 bootstrap replicates. In the tree construction, the Poisson correction method was used to compute the evolutionary distances ( Kumar et al., 2016 ). The online tool WEBLOGO ( Crooks et al., 2004 ) and MEME suite ( Bailey et al., 2009 ) were used to reveal and visualize the conserved motifs. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of CsAP2-09 was predicted using cNLS Mapper ( Kosugi et al., 2009 ) and the promoter was cloned and analyzed by PlantCARE database ( Lescot et al., 2002 ). 2.3 Subcellular localization analysis The full-length coding sequence of CsAP2-09 was amplified and fused at the 3′ terminus, maintaining the reading frame of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding region (Supplementary Fig. 1A) and expressed in the pCX-DG vector which is under the control of the CaMV35S promoter (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The primers containing Bam HI restriction site were designed for amplification: (F-SL): 5′-CGCGGATCCATGTTGGATCTCAATCTCGA-3′, (R-SL): 5′-CGCGGATCCGCTTCTGTAATTGCGCAAT-3′. Then recombined plasmid was transformed to E . coli DH5 α competent cells and identified by PCR or digested by Bam HI. For transient expression analysis, correct plasmids and control vector were transformed to Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 competent cells and then infect onion epidermal cells and place in the dark for 48 h. The GFP signal (green) was microscopically observed with a filter of fluorescein isothiocyanate (LSM 700, Zeiss, Germany) and captured photos under both bright and dark fields. 2.4 Citrus canker disease and exogenous hormone assay Xcc was cultivated at 28 °C for overnight and harvested at OD600 = 0.5 and then diluted by 1000 folds. Xcc was inoculated in leaves of Wanjincheng orange and Calamondin in an incubator at 28 °C with 16 h light/8 h dark. Collect samples at 0, 1, 3, 5 dpi (days post inoculation). The leaves were prepared as 7 mm leaf discs and soaked them into differently induced environment, such as 100 μmol/L MeJA, 10 μmol/L SA, 10 μmol/L ET. Then total RNA was isolated at 0, 6, 12, 24 hpi (hours post induction). Liquid nitrogen was used to immediately freeze the collected samples and stored at −80 °C until further analyses. 2.5 Overexpression and RNAi plasmid construction The full-length CDS of CsBAP2-09 was amplified with the primer pair (F-OEc): CGCGGATCCATGTTGGATCTCAATCTCGA, (R-OEc): CGCGTCGACTTAGCTTCTGTAATTGCGA and ligated into the vector pGLNe at the restriction sites Bam HI/ Sal I to construct over-expression vector (Supplementary Fig. 2A) with CaMV 35S promoter (Supplementary Fig. 2B). For RNAi vector, a 300 bp fragment was amplified with the primer pair (F-RIc): CGCGGATCCATGTTGGATCTCAATCTCGA, (R-Ric): CGCGTCGACTTAGCTTCTGTAATTGCGA and integrated into the PUC-RANi Vector. The RNA interference sequence including forward, intron, and reverse sequence was digested by Asc I/ Bam HI to insert pLGNe (Supplementary Fig. S3A). In the RNAi Plasmid, the 359 - bp fragment was controlled by the 35S (CaMV35S) promoter (Supplementary Fig. 3B). 2.6 Citrus transformation and characterization of transgenic lines The two recombinant plasmids for overexpression and RNAi mutant were verified by sequencing and restrict enzyme digesting and then introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 by heat shock. The shoot segments transformation of Wanjincheng orange ( Citrus sinensis ) was performed using agrobacterium (Supplementary Fig. 4). Genomic PCR was done to confirm the presence of transgenic, first with primer pairs: (F-OEd): 5′-ATGAAGCATCTATCCAAAGAAGAAT-3′, (R-OEd): 5′-CTCATGGCTTTGGGGAGGCATTGTT-3′ for overexpression lines and (F-RId): 5′-GACGATAATAATAATAATAATT-3′, (R-RId): 5′-AATTATTATTATTATTATCGTC-3′ for RNAi lines. Followed the PCR detection, Gus stain was performed to confirm the transgenic lines. The histochemical procedure was applied Gus in transgenic plants to check for Gus activity ( Sendín et al., 2017 ). Leaf discs of transgenic citrus were infiltrated in X-GLUC solution (5‑bromo‑4‑chloro‑3‑indolyl‑betad‑glucoronide) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following this, leaves were cleared by soaking in 70% ethanol. The reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was done to analyze the endogenous CsAP2-09 expression levels in the positive lines or the transgenic lines. The WT was taken as the control in the PCR verification, Gus stain, and qRT-PCR detection. 2.7 Assay for resistance to citrus canker An in vitro assay was performed to demonstrate the resistance of transgenic lines to Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri ( Peng et al., 2017 ). For this, XccYN1 was inoculated in fully mature healthy leaves, and per line, four leaves were tested. Per leaf, on six infected sites, six punctures each were made using a 0.5 mm diameter pin. To each puncture site, 1 μL bacterial suspension (1 ∗ 105 CFU/mL) was applied. On the 10th day, photographs of these sites were taken. Image J 2.0 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to analyze the diseased spots. The 36 punctures in four leaves formed the basis of the disease intensity of each line and the following rating index was used: 0, <0.25 mm 2 (the size of the inoculating pin); 1, 0.25–0.75 mm 2 ; 3, 0.75–1.25 mm 2 ; 5, 1.25–1.75 mm 2 ; 7, >1.75 mm 2 . The level of resistance to Xcc, defined as disease index (DI), which was calculated with the formula: DI = ∑ [No. of each index ∗ the corresponding index] = (36 ∗ 7) ∗ 100. The experiment was repeated six times. 2.8 RNA-seq analysis to transgenic plants To identify the downstream genes regulated by CsAP2-09 in transgenic lines, RNA-Seq strategy was performed. Three non-transgenic plants (WT) and three overexpression transgenic lines with the same genetic background served as biological replicates. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of transgenic lines OE5, 6, 10 and WTs with RNasy Plant Mini Kit (AidLab, Beijing, China), and was shipped to the NOVOgene Inc. for cDNA library construction and sequencing on the IlluminaHiSeq2000TM platform. The three steps for construction of sequencing library were: (i) check the quality of RNA using Agilent Eukaryote Total RNA Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA); (ii) construction of library using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample PreKit (Illumina, San Diego, USA); (iii) quantitative analysis of library with QuantStudio 7 (Applied Biosystems, USA). After sequencing, the data were processed in four steps: (i) data filtering and removing surplus adaptors; (ii) map the short reads of high quality on the Citrus sinensis reference genome (Version 2, http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/orange/download/index.php ), sequenced, assembled and annotated by CAP ( Xu et al., 2013 ); (iii) assembly the transcript by TopHat software (version 2.0.9); and (iv) quantify the expression of genes (in fragments per kb transcript per million mapped reads or FPKM) using Cufflinks V2 ( Trapnell et al., 2012 ). A robust method that can be used for profiling gene expression is RNA-Seq, that elucidates the transgenic genes regulated molecules ( Liu et al., 2015 ). Here, detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was also done. For each gene, the fold change (FC) was expressed as the log transformation (base 2) of the FPKM specific value (transgenic line/wild-type). The gene is considered upregulated If FC > 1, and the gene is downregulated if FC < 1. To annotate the DEGs, Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment and pathway analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were conducted between WT and overexpression samples. To validate the transcriptomic data, qRT-PCR analysis of some DEGs were performed. 2.9 qRT-PCR assay qRT-PCR was used in this study to quantify expression of the CsAP2-09 in wild-types and in transgenic plants or induced by different hormones and Xcc in wild-type, and the expression of genes involved in RNAseq data. The samples were used for total RNA extraction from the samples using the miniprep kit (AidLab, Beijing, China) according to the kit's instructions and reverse transcribed to cDNA using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Then the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (95 °C, 5 min; 95 °C, 10 s; 56–63 °C 30 s, 45 cycles) were performed with the QuantStudio 7 (Applied Biosystems, USA) system using the SYBR Premix ExTaq Green PCR Kit (BIO-RAD, USA). The 20 μL qPCR reaction mixture contained SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (10 μL), forward and reverse primers (0.5 μM), and cDNA template (100 ng). The Actin gene of citrus (GenBank accession: GU911361.1 ) was the internal control for sweet orange and mandarin and amplified using primer pair (F-Actin): GTTGCAGCAATGCCAGTGAA and (R-Actin): GCGGCAGATGTGTTTTGTGT. A pair of primer pair (F-AP2): AGTTCCCTTTGGGCATCTCG and (R-AP2): ACCATTTGCAGATCCGTCGT designed with NCBI. The expression levels of AP2-09 mRNA were analyzed using Primer BLAST. Relative expression levels of each examined gene were evaluated using the 2 −∆∆CT method ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ). The formula for the calculation of ΔCT and ΔΔCT are: ΔCT = CT target − CT reference and ΔΔCT = ΔCT treated sample − ΔCT untreated sample . Amplification of each gene was done in triplicates. 2.10 Statistical analysis All the data were statistically analyzed using SPSS software (Version 22) and the differences were evaluated using variance (ANOVA) based on Fisher's LSD test, with a significant difference of P < 0.05. 3 Results 3.1 Isolation and bioinformatics analysis of CsAP2-09 The full-length of TF CsAP2-09 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from the whole cDNA of Wanjincheng orange. It contains 1464 nucleotides and its open reading frame (ORF) encodes 488 amino acid residues (Supplementary Table 1). To analyze CsAP2-09 in deep, the AP2 family in Citrus sinensis and Vitis vinifera , Populus trichocarpa and Arabidopsis thaliana was expertly annotated and in total 12, 15, 28 and 14 AP2s were obtained especially. Based on the phylogeny NJ tree, the AP2 family was categorized into four subgroups. In the four subgroups, there are 3, 2, 4 and 3 CsAP2 genes, respectively (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 5A). CsAP2-09 is involved in subgroup IV which shares homology with other AP2s such as AT2G28550 of Arabidopsis thaliana ( Nakano et al., 2006 ), CsAP2-12 of Citrus sinensis ( Ito et al., 2014 ; Xie et al., 2014 ), GSVIVG01016352001 of Vitis vinifera ( Licausi et al., 2010 ) and Potri.008G045300 of Populus trichocarpa ( Zhuang et al., 2008 ) ( Fig. 1 A ; Supplementary Fig. 5A). The homologies were reported as TFs involved in biotic or abiotic responses. From the phylogenetic tree and the MEME results, we infer that AP2s in each group contain similar motifs style which indicate similar functions (Supplementary Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table 3). Base on the alignment of the 15 AP2s involved in group IV, two very conserved AP2 domains 1 and 2 can be detected ( Fig. 1 B). Based on all the 12 AP2s in Citrus sinensis , the two AP2 domains that make the core element of AP2s can also be detected which confer the AP2s the AP2 TF functions ( Fig. 1 C). 3.2 CsAP2-09 localizes to the nucleus Transcription factors should be in the nucleus to perform a function of DNA binding. To determine whether CsAP2-09 is in the nucleus, we used both software prediction and transient expression system. Two nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences: RAYDRAAIKFRGVDADLNFGVTDYEEDMKQMKH and RGSSKYRGVTLHKCGRWEARMGQLLGK KAYDK were observed by NLS with nuclear loci value 5.4 and 4.9 respectively which are even larger than non-nuclear signal loci value. The recombinant plasmid of the GFP-CsAP2-09 fusion protein was expressed transiently in onion epidermal cells. The microscope image showed that the only GFP was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Fig. 2 A ), while the GFP-CsAP2-09 fusion protein localized in the nucleus specifically ( Fig. 2 B). Thus, CsAP2-09 appears to be a nuclear-localized protein which should be possible to regulate downstream genes as a transcription factor. 3.3 CsAP2-09 gene expression was up-induced by Xcc in Calamondin The protein presented different expression levels after inoculation at 0, 1, 3, and 5 dpi and was detected by qRT-PCR analysis. In canker sensitive plant Wanjincheng orange there was no significant increase during all the 5 days, while in canker resistant plant Calamondin there was significant rise at 3 dpi and this trend lasted to the peak expression level at the end of treatment ( Fig. 3 ). The expression profiles induced by Xcc indicate that CsAP2-09 is a citrus canker related gene which should improve the canker resistance and the upregulation of expression should enhance the Xcc tolerance. 3.4 CsAP2-09 gene expression was induced by exogenous hormone The core promoter of CsAP2-09 includes various cis-elements, such as MeJA-responsiveness element (CGTCA-motif), salicylic acid responsiveness element (TCA-element), ethylene-responsive element (TGA-element) and so on which involve stress or plant hormone responses (Supplementary Table 4). To analyze the relationships between some cis-elements and the expression of CsAP2-09 in wild-type Wanjincheng orange and Calamondin, the induction tests by exogenous hormone was performed. The exogenous salicylic acid (SA) did not induce significantly different expression of CsAP2-09 in Calamondin up to 24 hpi, while CsAP2-09 had the peak expression level after 6 hpi in Wanjincheng orange ( Fig. 4 A ) and then the expression fell to a lower level than in the pretreated sample. In contrast, methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) could induce significant changes of gene expression level in Calamondin but no significant changes in Wanjincheng orange up to 12 hpipi. After 24 hpi, CsAP2-09 expression in Wanjincheng orange was even lower than in the pretreated sample ( Fig. 4 B). Under the induction of ethylene (ET), CsAP2-09 expression increased in both Wanjincheng orange and Calamondin. The beginning of expression increase was 12 hpi in Wanjincheng orange while expression increased immediately after the treatment in Calamondin ( Fig. 4 C). In this study, CsAP2-09 could be induced by SA, MeJA and ET which indicates that CsAP2-09 should be involved in the disease resistance signaling pathway of SA, MeJA and ET pathways. The SA, MeJA pathways are always involved in biotic stress and the plant development. 3.5 Over-expression of CsAP2-09 conferred Xcc resistance to transgenic citrus To further investigate the functions of CsAP2-09 in Xcc resistance, we generated transgenic citrus lines. Confirmed by genomic PCR and Gus stain, six lines (OE1, OE3, OE5, OE6, OE8 and OE10) with the transgenic integration of CsAP2-09 were verified. The transgenic positives can be detected with 2 bands gel while the non-transgenic ones can only be observed 1 band from the original genome ( Fig. 5 A ). In the Gus stain, positives show the blue ( Fig. 5 B). Lines without the CsAP2-09 insertion were discarded and in remaining lines, and then qRT-PCR was carried out to analyze the mRNA production. The six transgenic lines with very high level of expression were considered to exhibit a relatively high expression level of CsAP2-09 compared with wild-type. Expression of CsAP2-09 in OE3 was the highest while OE1 was the lowest ( Fig. 5 C). Among the 6 OE-expression lines, OE1 and OE3 exhibited abnormal growth rate with a little larger size compared with WT ( Fig. 5 D). The canker resistance of the transgenic citrus lines was characterized by evaluating the six lines containing 35S:CsAP2-09 for their resistance to Xcc by inoculation through pin-pricking. The development of the disease was analyzed at 10 dpi. With the control (pinprick inoculation with LB medium instead of Xcc) ( Fig. 6 A1 ), in transgenic lines OE1, OE5, OE6, OE8, OE10 the rate pustule-eruption on the surface of the leaf significantly slower than that on the wild-type leaf. Hence, diseased lesions on the leaf of transgenic lines were notably smaller than those on the wild-type except OE3 ( Fig. 6 A2). These observations showed that over-expression of CsAP2-09 inhibited the pustule-development that was induced by Xcc infection. In OE3, there should be something changed. For example, the insertion of CsAP2-09 destroyed the insertion sites which are related to citrus canker. The larger size of OE3 maybe also explained as above. The insertion site may be an interesting point for a following research. On statistical evaluation, the diseased lesions on the six lines (OE1, OE5, OE6, OE8, OE10) were notably smaller compared to those on the wild-type. Thus, in the transgenic lines, the spread of the pathogen on the surface of the leaf was absolutely repressed ( Fig. 6 B). Correspondingly, on evaluating the disease index of the seven lines, their values were notably lower than that of the wild-type ( Fig. 6 C). There was a reduction by 19.3%–46.0% in the disease severity in these seven lines compared with the disease intensity of the wild-type. When these results were compared with those of the in vitro assay, these seven over-expressed lines showed robust and steady resistance to citrus canker, with the highest resistance in the line OE6 ( Fig. 6 B, C). 3.6 Silencing of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange leads to Xcc susceptibility The role of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange was further evaluated. For this, we knocked down the exogenous CsAP2-09 of sweet orange (Wanjincheng orange) using RNAi strategy. Selected with PCR verification, six RNAi mutant transgenic lines were obtained ( Fig. 7 A ) and with Gus stain verification the six putative positive lines were also detected as positive ( Fig. 7 B). Through qRT-PCR, five lines (R1, R2, R4, R5, R6) were shown to express a relatively low level of CsAP2-09 compared with WT line while CsAP2-09 expression in R3 was not silenced ( Fig. 7 C). Among the five RNAi-mutant lines, R1 exhibited abnormal growth rate with very smaller plant size compared with WT line which tells that the insertion of CsAP2-09 to the genome changed the normal phenotypes while R2, R4, R5 and R6 possess no phenotypic change ( Fig. 7 D). The five RNAi mutant lines were also evaluated for Xcc resistance by inoculation through pinprick. With the control (pinprick inoculation with LB medium instead of Xcc) ( Fig. 8 A1 ) transgenic lines R1, R2, R5 and R6 exhibited larger pustule eruptions on the leaf surface while R4 exhibited smaller pustule eruption of pustules. These observations showed that most of RNAi mutants of CsAP2-09 enhanced the sensibility of the Xcc infection, and line R5 and R6 showed the greatest propensity to develop canker ( Fig. 8 A2). After analyzing statistically, it was seen that diseased lesions in four lines (R1, R2, R5, and R6) were notably bigger than the lesions in the wild-type. The lesion area in those four lines was not significantly different from each other, thus, the expansion of the pathogen on the leaf surface was absolutely increased in RNAi transgenic lines ( Fig. 8 B). On estimating disease severity, it was seen that the disease index of R1, R2, R5 and R6 was notably higher than that compared to the wild-type ( Fig. 8 C). An enhancement by 0.5%–19.4% in disease index was seen in these lines compared with the wild-type disease index. The in vitro assay results reveal that silencing of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange leads to Xcc susceptibility which further elucidates the role of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange against Xcc. 3.7 Differentially expressed genes in transgenic citrus OE5, OE6 and OE10 lines exhibited the similar expression levels, normal phenotypes, similar Xcc resistance enhancements which can be taken as a good material to evaluate the functional mechanism of CsAP2-09. To discern the changes in transcript levels of CsAP2-09 regulated genes, we carried out a comparative transcriptome analysis using leaves of OE5, OE6, OE10 (As three biological triplicates) and three WT controls (as biological triplicates). A total of 587 differently expressed gene (DEGs) were identified, of which 485 were upregulated and 102 were downregulated (Supplementary Fig. 7; Supplementary Tables S5, S6) total of 374 GO terms and 57 KEGG terms were enriched in the transcriptome of overexpression line (Supplementary Tables S7, S8). The top 30 GO terms (Supplementary Fig. 8A; Supplementary Fig. S6A) and KEGG pathways (Supplementary Fig. 8B; Supplementary Fig. S6B) were detailed. Overexpression of CsAP2-09 influenced multiple processes including pathogen defense response, transcription regulation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and so on ( Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 8B). To validate the RNAseq data, a supplementary qRT-PCR analysis was done on some DEGs (Primers see Supplementary Table S9). The transcriptomic data were validated by all the genes analyzed through qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Table S10). The comparative transcriptome analysis of OE-AP2-09 lines and WT plants reveal that there were changes in the expression of several genes involved in transcript regulation and pathogen response due to CsAP2-09 overexpression. Apart from this, some genes take part in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis also be influenced ( Table 1 ). These DEGs in the transgenic lines should be downstream genes which should work together to enhances the Xcc resistance in transgenic lines. The raw data of RNAseq project was submitted in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with an accession PRJNA505360. 4 Discussion 4.1 TF CsAP2-09 is involved in Xcc resistance and signaling pathways The citrus industry is threatened by many biotic and abiotic challenges, including bacterial canker disease. For crop genetic improvement, potential citrus canker-related genes should be the key factor which will promote efficiency of molecular breeding. Citrus bacterial canker is regulated by various transcription factors. In this study, we identified the CsAP2-09 transcription factor, which belongs to the AP2 sub-family of AP2/ERF super family. Many members of the AP2 subfamily that respond to abiotic and biotic stresses have been reported ( Zhuang et al., 2008 ; Xie et al., 2014 ; Raines et al., 2016 ; Najafi et al., 2018 ; Nie et al., 2018 ), but their participation in Citrus bacterial canker has never been demonstrated. In our study, the bioinformatics information, the induction by exogenous hormone and Xcc, overexpression and RNAi in Wanjincheng orange, collectively indicated that the CsAP2-09 was involved in Citrus bacterial canker response and tolerance. The CsAP2-09 contains common motifs with AP2s from Arabidopsis, grape and Populus ( Nakano et al., 2006 ; Zhuang et al., 2008 ; Ito et al., 2014 ; Xie et al., 2014 ) ( Fig. 1 B). Based on all the AP2s in Citrus sinensis , the two AP2 domains that make the core element of AP2s can also be detected which confer the AP2s the AP2 TF functions ( Fig. 1 C). The homologies from other species were reported as TFs involved in biotic or abiotic responses. Based on the transient expression, CsAP2-09 appears to be a nuclear-localized protein which should be possible to regulate downstream genes as a transcription factor. In our study, CsAP2-09 showed different expression profiles between citrus canker sensitive cultivate Wanjincheng and citrus canker resistant cultivate Calamondin induced by Xcc and exogenous hormone such as SA, ET and JA. In one aspect, the inducible expression indicated the involvements of CsAP2-09 in the signal pathways or in the citrus canker disease responses and tolerance. In other aspect, the Xcc induction also give light to the different functions of CsAP2-09 promotors in citrus canker sensitive cultivate and citrus canker resistant cultivate. It is the reason why the two cultivates possess different CsAP2-09 expression profiles which brought different citrus canker disease resistance. So, the promoters are worth further study to explore the functional differences between citrus canker resistant and sensitive varieties. 4.2 Transgenic CsAP2-09 enhances the expression of genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis The present study indicates that some DEGs involved in Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, such as O -methyltransferase super family (Cs5g16860), NAD dependent epimerase (orange1.1t02755), Zinc-binding dehydrogenase genes (Cs1g20610) and downregulated genes such as AMP-binding enzymes ( Table 1 ). The core of the phenylpropanoid pathway is phenylpropanoid, and it catalyzes the deamination of phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid in a non-oxidative reaction ( Dempsey et al., 2011 ; Chen et al., 2009 ). Ultimately, trans-cinnamic acid is a precursor for the biological synthesis of several polyphenyl compounds such as flavonoids, lignins, plant hormones (e.g. SA), and phytoalexins (e.g., scopoletin, Scp), which participate in the SA pathway related to pathogen resistance and other stresses ( Alexander et al., 1993 ). 4.3 Transgenic CsAP2-09 enhances the expression of plant-pathogen interaction genes plant hormone signal transduction In the transgenic plants, Class III peroxidase (orange1.1t02036), Respiratory burst NADPH oxidase (Cs8g12000) are upregulated by the overexpression of CsAP2-09. These DEGs are always involved in pathogen defense or abiotic stresses ( Li et al., 2015 ). Plant hormones and plant hormone signaling pathways regulate complex signaling networks related to plant development and responses to environmental stresses ( Bari and Jones, 2009 ). GH3, AUX/IAA family are always involved in stress defense and essential for responses to changing environments by mediating growth, development, nutrient allocation and source sink transitions ( Peleg and Blumwald, 2011 ). GH3 gene family is essential to plant growth and development. GH3 genes contain auxin-responsive cis-acting elements (AuxRE) in their promoter regions and react rapidly and transiently to auxin signaling ( Woodward and Bartel, 2005 ). 5 Conclusion In summary, we demonstrated that overexpression of citrus canker disease-resistance gene CsAP2-09 in Wanjincheng orange confers resistance to citrus canker. The CsAP2-09 belongs to the group IV of the AP2 family, is in the nucleus and induced by hormone and Xcc. Most of the transgenic plants were morphologically normal compared with the wild type, indicating that modification of the CsAP2-09 expression does not disrupt plant development. Evidence from RNA-Seq of transgenic plants indicates that overexpression of CsAP2-09 changes expression of genes involved in Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, Plant-pathogen interaction, Plant hormone signal transduction and some TFs. This study enriches people's understanding of the relationship between development and biotic stress in plant. Further research is in progress to study the co-expression proteins with pull-down strategy and targeted genes with Chip-seq strategy which will help to construct the molecular mechanism of CsAP2-09. In addition, the disease resistance of transgenic plants observed under controlled conditions must be confirmed in field trials.
