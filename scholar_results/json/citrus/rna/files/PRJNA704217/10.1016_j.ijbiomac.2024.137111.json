A total of nine key differentially expressed genes of starch metabolism were validated. Among them, seven starch synthesis-related genes were significantly upregulated, and two starch degradation-related genes, CgBAM4 and CgBAM6 , were significantly downregulated. Meanwhile, the relative expression of synthesis-related genes was positively correlated with starch accumulation and leaf chlorosis. Using transient overexpression and VIGS experiments in pomelo, we confirmed the function of CgGBSS2 , which was the only amylose synthesis-related key gene with the most significantly upregulated expression level. We proposed a working model to illustrate the regulatory network of starch excess accumulation involving in citrus leaf chlorosis of incompatible graft in the end. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism underlying leaf chlorosis process in rootstock-scion incompatibility."

          "Citrus holds a prominent position in the agricultural industry, with its production volume and cultivation area ranking first among fruit trees in China [ 1 ]. Grafting is commonly used to enhance production, while rootstock-scion incompatibility often occurs in orchards [ 2 ]. Leaf chlorosis is typical visible symptom of rootstock-scion incompatibility in citrus [ 3 ], which can take years to manifest and lead to a decline in citrus yields and quality. Some research has shown that leaf chlorosis in grafted plants may be induced by nutrient deficiency [ 4 , 5 ], virus [ 6 ] and other factors [ 7 ]. Generally, the process of citrus leaf chlorosis is slow, and the chlorosis symptom typically appears via many years even ten to twenty years after grafting [ 8 ]. Obviously, such a long process would involve various external factors with high uncertainty. As a result, citrus leaf chlorosis caused by rootstock-scion incompatibility remains to be explored.",
          "Recently, abnormal starch accumulation has been observed in the graft union of incompatible grafts in pear [ 9 ] and Cucurbitaceae plants [ 10 ], indicating that starch may affect graft compatibility. It is well known that starch in leaves plays a crucial role in the growth and development of plants [ 11 ]. Biotic or abiotic stresses, as well as mutations in the starch metabolic pathways, cause excessive buildup of starch in the leaves [ 12 , 13 ]. For example, studies on the rice leaf chlorosis mutant ossac4 (starch accumulating 4) have suggested that excessive starch accumulation is responsible for leaf chlorosis [ 14 ]. Similar findings were also observed in ossac3 (starch accumulating 3) and esl10 (early senescence leaf 10) mutants [ 15 ]. Meanwhile, the extensive involvement of multiple genes encoding starch metabolism enzymes has been demonstrated [ 16 ]. So far, the molecular regulatory pathways for starch excess accumulation underlying leaf chlorosis in incompatible grafts remained unknown.",
          "Our previous studies found that ‘Guanxi miyou’ [ Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck] is compatible with the widely used trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata ), whereas its mutation ‘Hongmian miyou’ is incompatible. While these two scions were grafted onto Citrus junos cv. Shuzhen No.1, the new rootstock selected by our group, exhibited rootstock-scion compatibility. Utilizing these rootstock-scion combinations, we highlighted the unique features of the incompatibility, including growth status [ 17 , 18 ], photosynthetic characteristics [ 19 ], mineral elements level [ 20 ], and endogenous hormones balance [ 20 ]. Particularly, the foliage etiolation symptoms from the incompatible scion appeared in short time and demonstrated typically about 5 months after grafting [ 18 , 20 , 21 ], enabling us to explore the foliage etiolation caused by citrus rootstock-scion interaction. In addition, excessive starch accumulation in the lamina and midribs of chlorotic leaves were also observed in incompatible grafts [ 20 ]. Hence, these incompatible/compatible scion-rootstock combinations can be considered as potential mode to research on the mechanism of starch excess involving in citrus leaf chlorosis by rootstock-scion incompatibility.",
          "To clear starch excessive accumulation underlying leaf chlorosis in citrus incompatible grafts, here we applied the typical incompatible / compatible scion-rootstock combinations, including ‘Hongmian miyou’ grafted onto P. trifoliata (incompatible combination, Hm/Pt), and ‘Hongmian miyou’ grafted onto ‘Shuzhen No.1’ and ‘Guanxi miyou’ grafted onto P. trifoliata , respectively (compatible combinations, Hm/Cj and Gx/Pt). We comprehensively investigated the starch content and distribution in 116 various chlorotic leaves, as well as identified starch metabolism-related genes and performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of incompatible and compatible citrus grafts. Our objectives were to (i) characterize the relationship between leaf chlorosis and starch accumulation, (ii) identify key genes related to starch metabolism involved in leaf chlorosis, (iii) validate nine differentially expressed key genes of starch metabolism, and (iv) verify the function of CgGBSS2 , the most significantly upregulated starch synthesis-related gene. This study can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of citrus rootstock-scion incompatibility."

On this basis, we first measured the SPAD values of chlorotic leaves from incompatible grafts in Hm/Pt and then classified them into eight distinct stages, denoted as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8, with SPAD value of 80 to 90, 70 to 80, 60 to 70, 50 to 60, 40 to 50, 30 to 40, 20 to 30 and 10 to 20, respectively ( Fig. 1 , A). Starch was observed to be mainly distributed in the upper epidermal palisade cells and the xylem tissue of the leaf veins. In particular, the more starch accumulated in the leaves, the more severe the leaf chlorosis was. Furthermore, in the eight stages, the content of starch and chlorophyll exhibited opposite trends ( Fig. 1 , B). The leaves in S1 exhibited the lowest total starch content at 45.90 mg/g but the highest chlorophyll content at 657.63 μg/g. In contrast, the leaves in S8 demonstrated the highest starch level at 196.36 mg/g but the lowest chlorophyll level at 58.00 μg/g ( Fig. 1 , B). There was no difference in starch content from the roots of compatible and incompatible graft combinations (Fig. S2 A), and also there was no excessive sugar accumulation in the leaves and roots from incompatible graft combinations (Hm/Pt, Fig. S2 B). The consistency in the trends between starch accumulation and leaf chlorosis indicated that excessive starch accumulation in the epidermal palisade cells and leaf veins may be responsible for the leaf chlorosis of incompatible grafts."

                  "Using 116 various chlorotic leaves from the incompatible grafts, we further focused on the starch accumulation pattern by comparatively assessing their chlorophyll, total starch, amylose and amylopectin contents ( Fig. 1 , C, D). These leaves exhibited varying levels of chlorophyll, amylose, amylopectin, and total starch, ranging from 51.04 to 808.94 μg/g, 3.73 to 90.51 mg/g, 6.35 to 134.91 mg/g, and 30.59 to 225.45 mg/g, respectively ( Fig. 1 , C). With a threshold value of 300 μg/g for chlorophyll content, we defined leaves with higher chlorophyll levels as green, and those below the threshold were defined as yellow. Similarly, with the threshold values of 40 μg/g for amylose, 60 μg/g for amylopectin, and 100 μg/g for total starch contents, we defined leaves with higher levels of those as starch excess leaves, and the rest as normal leaves. Thus we classed the 116 various chlorotic leaves into four grades, G1 (Yellow, Excess), G2 (Yellow, Normal), G3 (Green, Excess) and G4 (Green, Normal). Many chlorotic leaves demonstrated excessive amylose, amylopectin, and total starch levels through statistical testing with a 95 % confidence interval ( Fig. 1 , C, Fig. S3). The chlorophyll content showed a significantly negatively correlated with the level of total starch, amylose, and amylopectin, with the most negative value of 0.76 observed for amylose content, and the most significantly positive correlation existed among total starch, amylose, and amylopectin ( P < 0.0001) ( Fig. 1 , D). These results imply that the reduction in chlorophyll content observed in chlorotic leaves was closely associated with excessive starch accumulation, particularly amylose deposition within the leaf tissues. The starch accumulation pattern in chlorotic leaves in chlorotic leaves further confirmed the close relationship between leaf chlorosis caused by rootstock-scion incompatibility and excessive accumulation of starch, especially amylose, in the leaves.",

However, graft incompatibility often occurred in orchards despite the use of appropriate grafting methods and adequately sized tissues [ 39 ]. Leaf chlorosis is the most prominent symptom observed in citrus incompatible graft, where excess starch concentrations were found in this study ( Fig. 1 ). It was reported that the accumulation of excess starch in leaves were responsible for leaf senescence by impairing the chloroplast [ 15 , 40 , 41 ] and thylakoid architecture [ 42 ], which implied that excessive starch buildup in the epidermal palisade cells and leaf veins contribute to the occurrence of leaf chlorosis in citrus incompatible grafts.",
              "Although our study provides critical insights into the relationship between starch accumulation and leaf chlorosis in citrus incompatible grafts, there are a few open issues. Our previous studies, we have investigated the morphological, physiological, biochemical and anatomical differences between the incompatible and compatible rootstock-scion combinations [ 18–21 ], demonstrating the balance disruption between the endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) may lead to the foliage etiolation [ 20 , 21 ]. While excessive starch accumulation may lead to the foliage etiolation, as confirmed by this study. Thus, there could potentially be hormone balance disruption signals to induce excessive starch accumulation, but currently, it remains unclear. Hence, further investigation into the regulatory networks linking endogenous hormones signals and excessive starch accumulation could gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of citrus rootstock-scion incompatibility underlying leaf chlorosis."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Citrus holds a prominent position in the agricultural industry, with its production volume and cultivation area ranking first among fruit trees in China [ 1 ]. Grafting is commonly used to enhance production, while rootstock-scion incompatibility often occurs in orchards [ 2 ]. Leaf chlorosis is typical visible symptom of rootstock-scion incompatibility in citrus [ 3 ], which can take years to manifest and lead to a decline in citrus yields and quality. Some research has shown that leaf chlorosis in grafted plants may be induced by nutrient deficiency [ 4 , 5 ], virus [ 6 ] and other factors [ 7 ]. Generally, the process of citrus leaf chlorosis is slow, and the chlorosis symptom typically appears via many years even ten to twenty years after grafting [ 8 ]. Obviously, such a long process would involve various external factors with high uncertainty. As a result, citrus leaf chlorosis caused by rootstock-scion incompatibility remains to be explored. Recently, abnormal starch accumulation has been observed in the graft union of incompatible grafts in pear [ 9 ] and Cucurbitaceae plants [ 10 ], indicating that starch may affect graft compatibility. It is well known that starch in leaves plays a crucial role in the growth and development of plants [ 11 ]. Biotic or abiotic stresses, as well as mutations in the starch metabolic pathways, cause excessive buildup of starch in the leaves [ 12 , 13 ]. For example, studies on the rice leaf chlorosis mutant ossac4 (starch accumulating 4) have suggested that excessive starch accumulation is responsible for leaf chlorosis [ 14 ]. Similar findings were also observed in ossac3 (starch accumulating 3) and esl10 (early senescence leaf 10) mutants [ 15 ]. Meanwhile, the extensive involvement of multiple genes encoding starch metabolism enzymes has been demonstrated [ 16 ]. So far, the molecular regulatory pathways for starch excess accumulation underlying leaf chlorosis in incompatible grafts remained unknown. Our previous studies found that ‘Guanxi miyou’ [ Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck] is compatible with the widely used trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata ), whereas its mutation ‘Hongmian miyou’ is incompatible. While these two scions were grafted onto Citrus junos cv. Shuzhen No.1, the new rootstock selected by our group, exhibited rootstock-scion compatibility. Utilizing these rootstock-scion combinations, we highlighted the unique features of the incompatibility, including growth status [ 17 , 18 ], photosynthetic characteristics [ 19 ], mineral elements level [ 20 ], and endogenous hormones balance [ 20 ]. Particularly, the foliage etiolation symptoms from the incompatible scion appeared in short time and demonstrated typically about 5 months after grafting [ 18 , 20 , 21 ], enabling us to explore the foliage etiolation caused by citrus rootstock-scion interaction. In addition, excessive starch accumulation in the lamina and midribs of chlorotic leaves were also observed in incompatible grafts [ 20 ]. Hence, these incompatible/compatible scion-rootstock combinations can be considered as potential mode to research on the mechanism of starch excess involving in citrus leaf chlorosis by rootstock-scion incompatibility. To clear starch excessive accumulation underlying leaf chlorosis in citrus incompatible grafts, here we applied the typical incompatible / compatible scion-rootstock combinations, including ‘Hongmian miyou’ grafted onto P. trifoliata (incompatible combination, Hm/Pt), and ‘Hongmian miyou’ grafted onto ‘Shuzhen No.1’ and ‘Guanxi miyou’ grafted onto P. trifoliata , respectively (compatible combinations, Hm/Cj and Gx/Pt). We comprehensively investigated the starch content and distribution in 116 various chlorotic leaves, as well as identified starch metabolism-related genes and performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of incompatible and compatible citrus grafts. Our objectives were to (i) characterize the relationship between leaf chlorosis and starch accumulation, (ii) identify key genes related to starch metabolism involved in leaf chlorosis, (iii) validate nine differentially expressed key genes of starch metabolism, and (iv) verify the function of CgGBSS2 , the most significantly upregulated starch synthesis-related gene. This study can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of citrus rootstock-scion incompatibility. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials We used Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck. cv. Hongmian miyou grafted onto Poncirus trifoliata L. as the incompatible graft combination (abbreviated as Hm/Pt), ‘Hongmian miyou’ grafted onto C. junos Siebold ex Tanaka cv. Shuzhen No.1 and C. grandis cv. Guanxi miyou grafted onto P. trifoliata as the compatible graft combinations, respectively (abbreviated as Hm/Cj and Gx/Pt, respectively) (Fig. S1). All materials were grafted in March 2020 utilizing the splice grafting method. Each treatment consisted of 150 plants. The plant materials were cultivated in the orchard of the Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China. In September 2020, 3–5 mature and healthy summer leaves from trees with consistent growth vigor were collected for follow-up studies. Asexual reproduction of ‘Hongmian miyou’ and ‘Guanxi miyou’ pomelo was conducted using layering to eliminate the impact of rootstocks for gene function analysis. These rooted pomelo plants and tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) plants were cultivated in the greenhouse of Sichuan Agricultural University. 2.2 Measurement of starch, soluble sugar and chlorophyll contents, and anatomical observations The amylose and amylopectin contents were determined employing the dual wavelength mixed standard method [ 22 ], at measurement wavelengths of 640 nm and 520 nm, and reference wavelengths of 440 nm and 775 nm, respectively. The soluble sugar contents were determined using a BC0030 Plant Soluble Sugar Content Assay Kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols on a SpectraMax Paradigm Muti-Mode Detection Platform (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA). The total starch content was calculated by adding the amylose and amylopectin contents. Chlorophyll was extracted and determined per the method of Wellburn and Lichtenthaler [ 23 ], utilizing a handheld SPAD-502 Plus chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan) in the field according to the methods of Cao et al. [ 24 ]. In addition, the paraffin cross-section of the leaf was stained with iodine‑potassium iodide, referring to the methods of He et al. [ 20 ]. They were observed on an Eclipse CI microscope (Nikon, Yokyo, Japan) and photographed with a Nikon DS-U3 (Nikon, Yokyo, Japan). 2.3 RNA-seq, transcriptome assembly, and expression analysis Chlorotic leaves from the incompatible combination (SPAD values below 20) and normal leaves from compatible combinations (Gx/Pt and Hm/Cj, SPAD values above 80) were selected for transcriptome sequencing. Three biological replicates were performed for each sample. RNA extraction, library construction, and transcriptome sequencing were completed by the Beijing Novogene Co., Ltd., Beijing, China (Table S1). The raw data was filtered using Fastp to remove the adapters and low-quality sequences. The clean reads were submitted to the China National GeneBank Database (CNGBdb) database sequence read archive, with accession number CNP0004941. TopHat2 (v.2.1.1) [ 25 ] was applied to align the clean reads to the reference genome of Citrus grandis cv. ‘Wanbaiyou’ (downloaded from the Citrus Pan-genome to Breeding Database, http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/ ) [ 26 ]. Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) values were computed with the RSEM tool (v.1.3.3) [ 27 ]. Genes with |log 2 FC| ≥ 1.0 were defined as differentially expressed genes. 2.4 Genome-wide identification and analysis of pomelo starch metabolism-related genes All pomelo starch metabolism-related proteins were identified by scanning the whole genome sequence and protein sequences of Citrus grandis cv. ‘Wanbaiyou’ using Tbtools (v2.019) [ 28 ]. The amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis and the protein domains of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP, PF00483), starch synthase (SS, PF00534 and PF08323), branching enzymes (BE, PF02806, PF02922, and PF00128), debranching enzymes (DBE, PF02922 and PF00128) [ 29 ], β-amylase (BAM, PF01373) and α-amylase (AMY, PF00128) genes were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource ( https://www.arabidopsis.org/ ) and Pfam databases ( https://pfam.xfam.org/ ) [ 30 ], respectively. Hmm-search in Tbtools (v2.019) [ 28 ] was applied to search the pomelo protein database. Redundant genes were excluded by merging those derived from the two approaches, and the candidate gene protein domains were confirmed through the InterPro online tool ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ ). The distribution of genes on the chromosomes and collinearity analysis were performed using Tbtools (v2.019) [ 28 ]. Genes were renamed according to their chromosomal positions. Multiple sequence alignment of all protein sequences containing conserved domains for phylogenetic analysis was carried out utilizing the neighbor-joining (NJ) method with a bootstrap value of 5000 in MEGA-X [ 31 ]. Conserved motif analysis of the identified gene family members employed the MEME online platform ( http://meme-suite.org/ ). The physicochemical properties of the protein sequences were analyzed using the Expasy ProtParam ( http://www.expasy.org/resources/protparam ), and the Plant-mPLoc website for subcellular localization prediction ( http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/plant-multi/ ). Additionally, promoter sequences were analyzed utilizing the PlantCARE website ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ ). 2.5 Quantitative real-time PCR analysis Fluorescent quantitative PCR primers were designed using the primer 5.0 software. β-Tubulin served as the reference gene. The primers used are listed in Table S2 . The specific method employed for total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, as well as PCR reaction program, were as described by He et al. [ 20 ]. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCt method. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test were conducted to analyze the difference between the samples at the 0.05 significance level. 2.6 Gene cloning and sequence analysis of CgGBSS2 and subcellular localization The CgGBSS2 coding sequence (CDS) was amplified using the PrimerSTAR® Max DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and then cloned into the pTOPO-Blunt vector. The CgGBSS2 tertiary structure was predicted by SWISS-MODEL ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ ) [ 32 ]. Multiple sequence alignment of CgGBSS2 with similar sequences from other species was performed in MEGA-X. The sequence alignment results were visualized utilizing the ESPript 3.0 website [ 33 ]. For the phylogenetic tree building, the NJ method in MEGA was employed, with a bootstrap value of 5000. The CDS region of CgGBSS2 was cloned into the pCAMBIA-35S- eGFP vector using the homologous recombination method. Then, the vector was employed to transformed the Agrobacterium strain GV3101 utilizing the heat shock method. Agrobacterium infection in Nicotiana benthamiana was conducted followed the protocols described by Jiang et al. [ 34 ]. FV3000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used for observation and photography. All primers used are listed in Table S2. 2.7 Transient overexpression in pomelo leaves and virus-induced gene silencing The CDS region of CgGBSS2 was cloned into the pCAMBIA-35SN vector using the homologous recombination method. Leaves from young pomelo shoots were selected for injection, with the 35SN empty vector injected on the left side of the main leaf vein and the 35SN:: CgGBSS2 vector injected on the right side, following the method described by Gong et al. [ 35 ]. The tissue around the injection site was collected seven days after injection as the sample for testing. The specific sequence of the CgGBSS2 (230 bp) gene was reverse-inserted into the pTRV2 vector. The pTRV1, pTRV 2, and pTRV – CgGBSS2 vectors were employed to transformed GV3101. Sour pomelo ( C. grandis ) seedlings were used for Agrobacterium infected following the protocol described by Wang et al. [ 36 ]. After four weeks of cultivation, DNA was extracted and the positive plants were identified. All primers used are listed in Table S2. 2.8 Data analysis The data was organized employing Microsoft Excel 2016, and statistically analyzed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Graphs were generated through GraphPad Prism (v.8.4.2) and Adobe Illustrator 2021. 3 Results 3.1 The relationship between starch accumulation and chlorotic leaves in citrus incompatible grafts 3.1.1 Characterization of leaf chlorosis Chlorophyll contents was closely and positively correlated with the SPAD values [ 24 ]. On this basis, we first measured the SPAD values of chlorotic leaves from incompatible grafts in Hm/Pt and then classified them into eight distinct stages, denoted as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8, with SPAD value of 80 to 90, 70 to 80, 60 to 70, 50 to 60, 40 to 50, 30 to 40, 20 to 30 and 10 to 20, respectively ( Fig. 1 , A). Starch was observed to be mainly distributed in the upper epidermal palisade cells and the xylem tissue of the leaf veins. In particular, the more starch accumulated in the leaves, the more severe the leaf chlorosis was. Furthermore, in the eight stages, the content of starch and chlorophyll exhibited opposite trends ( Fig. 1 , B). The leaves in S1 exhibited the lowest total starch content at 45.90 mg/g but the highest chlorophyll content at 657.63 μg/g. In contrast, the leaves in S8 demonstrated the highest starch level at 196.36 mg/g but the lowest chlorophyll level at 58.00 μg/g ( Fig. 1 , B). There was no difference in starch content from the roots of compatible and incompatible graft combinations (Fig. S2 A), and also there was no excessive sugar accumulation in the leaves and roots from incompatible graft combinations (Hm/Pt, Fig. S2 B). The consistency in the trends between starch accumulation and leaf chlorosis indicated that excessive starch accumulation in the epidermal palisade cells and leaf veins may be responsible for the leaf chlorosis of incompatible grafts. 3.1.2 Starch accumulation pattern in chlorotic leaves Using 116 various chlorotic leaves from the incompatible grafts, we further focused on the starch accumulation pattern by comparatively assessing their chlorophyll, total starch, amylose and amylopectin contents ( Fig. 1 , C, D). These leaves exhibited varying levels of chlorophyll, amylose, amylopectin, and total starch, ranging from 51.04 to 808.94 μg/g, 3.73 to 90.51 mg/g, 6.35 to 134.91 mg/g, and 30.59 to 225.45 mg/g, respectively ( Fig. 1 , C). With a threshold value of 300 μg/g for chlorophyll content, we defined leaves with higher chlorophyll levels as green, and those below the threshold were defined as yellow. Similarly, with the threshold values of 40 μg/g for amylose, 60 μg/g for amylopectin, and 100 μg/g for total starch contents, we defined leaves with higher levels of those as starch excess leaves, and the rest as normal leaves. Thus we classed the 116 various chlorotic leaves into four grades, G1 (Yellow, Excess), G2 (Yellow, Normal), G3 (Green, Excess) and G4 (Green, Normal). Many chlorotic leaves demonstrated excessive amylose, amylopectin, and total starch levels through statistical testing with a 95 % confidence interval ( Fig. 1 , C, Fig. S3). The chlorophyll content showed a significantly negatively correlated with the level of total starch, amylose, and amylopectin, with the most negative value of 0.76 observed for amylose content, and the most significantly positive correlation existed among total starch, amylose, and amylopectin ( P < 0.0001) ( Fig. 1 , D). These results imply that the reduction in chlorophyll content observed in chlorotic leaves was closely associated with excessive starch accumulation, particularly amylose deposition within the leaf tissues. The starch accumulation pattern in chlorotic leaves in chlorotic leaves further confirmed the close relationship between leaf chlorosis caused by rootstock-scion incompatibility and excessive accumulation of starch, especially amylose, in the leaves. A . Leaf chlorosis rating and starch granules distribution. Leaf chlorosis was divided into eight levels according to SPAD value (S1, 80–90; S2, 70–80; S3, 60–70; S4, 50–60; S5, 40–50; S6, 30–40; S7, 20–30; S8, 10–20). Red arrows indicated location of starch granules. Scale bars in leaves and anatomical structure represented 1 cm and 100 μm, respectively. B . Chlorophyll and total starch contents at eight levels of leaf chlorosis. C . Relationship between chlorophyll content and that of total starch, amylose, and amylopectin based on 116 various chlorotic leaves. G1 (Yellow, Excess), G2 (Yellow, Normal), G3 (Green, Excess) and G4 (Green, Normal) were classed based on the threshold value of 300 μg/g for chlorophyll content (Yellow/Green), and threshold values of 40 μg/g for amylose, 60 μg/g for amylopectin, and 100 μg/g for total starch contents (Excess/Normal). Elliptic shadow represented confidence interval (95 %). D . Correlation among total starch, amylose, amylopectin and chlorophyll. **** means P < 0.0001. 3.2 Genome-wide identification of starch metabolism-related genes in pumelo 3.2.1 Starch metabolism-related gene families and subcellular localization Using the pomelo genome of C. grandis cv. ‘Wanbaiyou’ [ 37 ], we identified genes associated with starch synthesis and degradation. A total of 36 genes from six enzyme gene families related to starch metabolism were identified, including six SS (starch synthase), 11 AGP (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase), three BE (branching enzyme), eight BAM (β-amylase), four AMY (α-amylase), and four DBE (debranching enzyme) family genes (Table S3). These 36 starch metabolism-related proteins exhibited diverse physical and chemical properties, with lengths ranging from 129 to 1233, molecular weights ranging from 14.01 to 138.05 kDa, and theoretical isoelectric points from 5.03 to 9.03. They were predicted to be mainly localized in the cytoplasmic (15 of 36), followed by the chloroplast (11 of 36) (Table S3). 3.2.2 Characteristics of starch metabolism-related genes A phylogenetic tree was conducted using amino acid sequences encoded by the starch metabolism-related genes of C. grandis cv. ‘Wanbaiyou’ and A. thaliana ( Fig. 2 , A). These 36 proteins clustered into eight distinct branches, with each pomelo gene family grouped together with the corresponding Arabidopsis gene family. The AGP, SS, BAM, and BE proteins formed separate branches, while the DBE and AMY families were clustered into two groups, respectively ( Fig. 2 , A). These 36 genes were located unevenly on the eight chromosomes (Fig. S4). Collinearity analysis revealed linear correlations between CgAPL2 and CgAPL4 , CgAPL3 and CgAPL8 , CgAPL6 and CgAPL7 , as well as CgGBSS1 and CgGBSS2 ( Fig. 2 , B). For conserved motifs and conserved domains analysis, the number and types of conserved motifs were consistent with the evolutionary relationship, and each gene contained a typical conserved domain. Moreover, the cis-acting elements in the promoter of the identified genes were analyzed following the method of Yang et al. [ 30 ] (Fig. S5, S6, S7, S8). Most were abiotic stress-responsive cis-elements, such as abscisic acid-induced response elements (ABREs), ARE, and MYB, the remaining 34 genes possessed ABREs. A . Phylogenetic tree of starch metabolism-related genes in pomelo and Arabidopsis thaliana . Cg and At were the abbreviations of Citrus grandis and A. thaliana , and their genes were marked with red stars and gray dots, respectively. B . Collinearity between starch metabolism-related genes. Gray lines indicated all the syntenic genes in the pomelo genome, and red lines denoted gene pairs in the starch metabolism-related gene families. C-G . Conserved motifs and conserved domains analysis. Different colored blocks above and below the lines indicated conserved domains and motifs, respectively. The lower axis represented the length of amino acids (AA). 3.3 Transcriptomic profiling of key genes associated with starch excess in citrus incompatible grafts 3.3.1 Expression pattern of starch metabolism-related genes We used 9 newly sequenced transcriptomes and previously sequencing data (NCBI: PRJNA704217) to analyze the expression patterns of the 36 starch metabolism-related genes. Notably, the P3 stage was characterized by the initial chlorosis of summer shoot leaves in Hm/Pt, with SPAD values ranging from 40 to 60 [ 20 ]. The P4 stage denoted the late stage of leaf chlorosis, with SPAD values below 20. Both Gx/Pt and Hm/Cj exhibited leaf SPAD values surpassing 80. Among the genes, CgGBSS2, CgBE1, CgBE3, CgAPL3, CgAPL8, CgISA3, and CgISA2 were highly expressed in the incompatible grafts (Hm/Pt) ( Fig. 3 , A). Meantime, the expression of the starch degradation-associated genes CgBAM4 was lesser in the Hm/Pt and Hm/Cj combinations compared to Gx/Pt, while that of CgBAM6 was higher in the compatible grafts (Hm/Cj and Gx/Pt) than in Hm/Pt ( Fig. 4 , A). Obviously, the qRT-PCR results were consistent with the RNA-seq data (R 2 = 0.9614) ( Fig. 3 , B). 3.3.2 Validation of nine key genes expression Furthermore, we employed qRT-PCR to ascertain the expression levels of these nine key genes in the samples S1 to S8 mentioned above ( Fig. 1 , A). Those of the starch synthesis-related genes CgGBSS2, CgBE1, CgBE3, CgAPL3, CgAPL8, CgISA3, and CgISA2 increased with the severity of leaf chlorosis, consistent with the trend of elevated starch contents in the leaves. Conversely, the expression levels of starch degradation genes CgBAM4 and CgBAM6 significantly decreased in severely yellowed S6, S7 and S8 leaves, which were characterized by high accumulation of starch ( Fig. 4 ). Overall, the qRT-PCR results indicated that these genes played crucial roles in regulating starch metabolism during graft incompatibility. Among the seven up-regulated starch synthesis-related genes, CgGBSS2 was the only key gene involved in amylose synthesis [ 38 ], and therefore may probably play a crucial role in excessive starch accumulation leading to citrus leaf chlorosis in incompatible graft. A . Heat map of genes that are specifically expressed in P1, P2, P3 and P4 leaves of Hm/Cj, Hm/Pt and Gx/Pt. P1, P2, P3 and P4 represented 140, 161, 182 and 198 days after grafting, respectively, and key candidate genes with |log 2 FC| > 1 and FPKM >1 were highlighted red. The color scale indicated log 2 (FPKM+1) values between −3.0 and 3.0. B . qRT-PCR validation of nine candidate genes in incompatible/ compatible grafts (Hm/Cj, Hm/Pt and Gx/Pt). The error bars with standard error were calculated from three biological replicates. The lowercase letters indicated significant difference at 0.05 level. S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8 showed leaf chlorosis levels, and detailed data in the note of Fig. 1 . Data were means ± standard error (SE). 3.4 Function verification of CgGBSS2 in regulating starch accumulation 3.4.1 Cloning, sequence analysis and subcellular localization of CgGBSS2 The CDS of CgGBSS2 , cloned from the leaves of Hm/Pt and Gx/Pt, were 1836 bp long with no differences between them. It encoded a 67.2 kDa protein, consisting of 611 amino acids, with two conserved domains: Glyco_transf_5 and Glycos_transf_1 (Fig. S9). The GBSS proteins were relatively conserved among different species (Fig. S10), but with variations between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, which were divided into two clusters in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S11). The green fluorescent signal from 35S:CgGBSS2-GFP colocalized with the endogenous chloroplast fluorescence, indicating that the CgGBSS2 was localized within the chloroplasts (Fig. S12). 3.4.2 Functional studies on CgGBSS2 We constructed CgGBSS2 into an overexpression vector to explore its role in starch synthesis in pomelo leaves. Chlorosis was observed in the leaves of Hm and Gx ( Fig. 5 , A-1, B-1). CgGBSS2 was overexpressed by 2.1- and 2.6-fold in Hm and Gx, respectively. A significant increase in the content of amylose and a marked reduction in amylopectin content was observed in the leaves of Hm and Gx ( Fig. 5 , A-3, B-3). Meanwhile, chlorophyll levels declined notably ( Fig. 5 , A-3, B-3). In addition, VIGS was employed to knock down CgGBSS2 in sour pomelo seedlings. The efficiency of gene silencing was assessed through PCR (Fig. S13). Compared to the TRV empty vector control, the expression level of CgGBSS2 in the positive VIGS plants was inhibited ranging from 17 % to 67 % ( Fig. 5 , C-1). Iodine‑potassium iodide staining revealed a significant reduction in starch granules in the leaves of CgGBSS2 silenced plants compared to the control ( Fig. 5 , C-2). The content of amylose, amylopectin, and total starch in CgGBSS2-silenced plants were significantly reduced. Surprisingly, the silenced plants also had significantly lower levels of chlorophyll and carotenoid ( Fig. 5 , C-3). A, B .

The data represented the means ± standard error (SE). 4 Discussion 4.1 Starch excess accumulation being responsible for leaf chlorosis caused by rootstock-scion incompatibility Rootstock-scion compatibility is crucial for the normal growth and development of grafted plants [ 39 ]. However, graft incompatibility often occurred in orchards despite the use of appropriate grafting methods and adequately sized tissues [ 39 ]. Leaf chlorosis is the most prominent symptom observed in citrus incompatible graft, where excess starch concentrations were found in this study ( Fig. 1 ). It was reported that the accumulation of excess starch in leaves were responsible for leaf senescence by impairing the chloroplast [ 15 , 40 , 41 ] and thylakoid architecture [ 42 ], which implied that excessive starch buildup in the epidermal palisade cells and leaf veins contribute to the occurrence of leaf chlorosis in citrus incompatible grafts. Although our study provides critical insights into the relationship between starch accumulation and leaf chlorosis in citrus incompatible grafts, there are a few open issues. Our previous studies, we have investigated the morphological, physiological, biochemical and anatomical differences between the incompatible and compatible rootstock-scion combinations [ 18–21 ], demonstrating the balance disruption between the endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) may lead to the foliage etiolation [ 20 , 21 ]. While excessive starch accumulation may lead to the foliage etiolation, as confirmed by this study. Thus, there could potentially be hormone balance disruption signals to induce excessive starch accumulation, but currently, it remains unclear. Hence, further investigation into the regulatory networks linking endogenous hormones signals and excessive starch accumulation could gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of citrus rootstock-scion incompatibility underlying leaf chlorosis. 4.2 Key genes of starch excess underlying citrus leaf chlorosis by rootstock-scion incompatibility Currently, members of the starch synthesis- and degradation-related gene families have been identified in various tissues of numerous plants [ 30 , 38 , 43–47 ]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on starch metabolism studies related to leaf chlorosis caused by scion-stock interaction in woody plants. In this study, on the basis of bioinformatic analysis, we performed genome-wide identification of 36 starch metabolism-related genes from six gene families ( Fig. 2 ). Further RNA-seq and qPCR ( Fig. 3 , 4) revealed that seven starch synthesis-related genes ( CgAPL3 , CgAPL8 , CgGBSS2 , CgBE1 , CgBE3 , CgISA3 and CgISA2 ) were significantly upregulated, while the starch degradation-related genes ( CgBAM4 and CgBAM6 ) were significantly downregulated in chlorotic leaves. Our results indicated the potential important regulatory role of these nine key genes in starch accumulation in leaf chlorosis by citrus rootstock-scion incompatibility. Particularly, CgGBSS2 positively regulates starch amylose synthesis ( Fig. 3 , 4 and 5) in this study. Similar results have been found in the rice premature senescence mutant ossac3 with starch accumulation and chlorophyll reduction [ 48 ]. Noteworthy, our experiments have also revealed that CgGBSS2 may regulate amylopectin synthesis, which is consistent with recent studies [ 49 , 50 ] indicating that GBSS may be responsible not only for amylose synthesis but also for amylopectin biosynthesis. Therefore, further experimental validation is warranted to unravel the function of CgGBSS2 during starch excess underlying citrus leaf chlorosis in citrus incompatible graft. As we mentioned above, the key genes involved in excessive starch accumulation have been identified, with CgGBSS2 playing a crucial role in this process. To better understand citrus leaf chlorosis caused by citrus rootstock-scion incompatibility, it is necessary to build the molecular regulatory network of these starch metabolism-related genes and hormone signals in particular transcription factors involving these pathways. 4.3 Working model for starch excess inducing citrus leaf chlorosis by rootstock-scion incompatibility Based on the results, we proposed a working model to illustrate the starch excess key genes inducing citrus leaf chlorosis caused by rootstock-scion interaction in Fig. 6 . The disruption of hormonal balance due to the incompatibility between the rootstock and scion [ 20 ], can cause metabolic disorder [ 51 ]. In the starch metabolism pathway, the upregulation of starch synthesis genes CgAPL3 , CgAPL8 , CgGBSS2 , CgBE1 , CgBE3 , CgISA3 , and CgISA2 in Hm/Pt, as well as the downregulation of starch degradation genes CgBAM4 and CgBAM6 , resulted in an increase of starch content. Meanwhile, we validated the regulatory role of CgGBSS2 in starch metabolism. The significant upregulation of CgGBSS2 in Hm/Pt plays a pivotal role in the excessive accumulation of leaf starch. Excessive starch in leaves leads to the destruction of chloroplast structure, degradation of chlorophyll, and ultimately leading to leaf chlorosis. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying differential expression of starch metabolism-related genes require further investigation. High expression of starch synthesis pathway key genes CgGBSS2 , CgBE1 , CgBE3 , CgAPL3 , CgAPL8 , CgISA3 , and CgISA2 in incompatible graft (Hm/Pt), among which, CgGBSS2 demonstrated significant upregulation, leading to aberrant accumulation of starch. The excessive presence of starch disrupts the cellular structure, resulting in the degradation of chlorophyll and subsequent leaf chlorosis. 5 Conclusion Based on the comprehensive investigation on the starch content and its distribution in 116 various chlorotic leaves, and genome-wide identification and comparative transcriptomic analysis, we cleared starch accumulation pattern in citrus chlorotic leaves of compatible graft, uncovering the close relationship between starch (especial amylose) excessive accumulation and leaf chlorosis caused by rootstock-scion incompatibility. We also identified 36 starch metabolism-related genes, of which, nine key genes were validated with seven significantly upregulated starch synthesis-related genes CgGBSS2 , CgBE1 , CgBE3 , CgAPL3 , CgAPL8 , CgISA3 and CgISA2 , and two significantly downregulated starch degradation-related genes CgBAM4 and CgBAM6 . Along with, we confirmed the function of the crucial gene CgGBSS2 involved in amylose synthesis by transient overexpression and VIGS experiments in pomelo. This study will contribute to a deep insight into the molecular mechanisms of citrus leaf chlorosis caused by rootstock-scion interaction.
