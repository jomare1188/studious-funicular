    "full_text": "The distinctive acidity of citrus fruit is determined by a regulatory complex of MYB and bHLH transcription factors together with a WDR protein (MBW complex) which operates in the unique juice vesicles of the fruit. We describe a mutation affecting the MYB protein, named Nicole, in sweet orange and identify its target genes that determine hyperacidification, specifically. We propose that the acidity, typical of citrus fruits, was the result of a loss of the ability of Nicole to activate the gene encoding anthocyanidin reductase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of proanthocyanidins, which are absent in citrus fruit."

          "Citrus fruits are well known for their acidity and, with a pH of around 2, lemon is the most acidic common constituent of the human diet. Many wild and cultivated citrus species and hybrids (including citron, most limes, “true” mandarins, trifoliate, and sour orange) share similarly high levels of acidity. The acidity of citrus fruit may have underpinned early uses as medicine and antiseptics. However, thousands of years of domestication have resulted in accessions with moderate acidity with a typical pH of around 3.5 for some mandarins and sweet orange fruit.",
          "Together with total soluble sugars, acidity is the major determinant of taste and quality of citrus fruit. The very low pH reflects the content of citric acid (citrate), which is produced within the juice vesicles, the unique structures that form the edible part of citrus fruit. 1 , 2 At the cellular level, citrate biosynthesis requires the coordinated activity of many enzymes in different compartments. It is generally assumed that reduced acidity was a key trait for citrus domestication, and genetic differences in citrate biosynthetic genes may explain differences in acidity between wild and cultivated citrus and between lemon and orange. 3 , 4",
          "Besides biosynthesis and degradation, a key step in citrate metabolism is its transport to the vacuole. The current understanding is that this process is achieved through a mechanism referred to as the “acid trap,” dependent on the pH of the vacuole and the electrochemical H + gradient across the tonoplast. 5 , 6 Acidification of the vacuole can be achieved through the activity of vacuolar pyrophosphatases and vacuolar ATPases, proton pumps ubiquitous in plants. In some species including citrus, however, a second distinct mechanism has been identified which requires the activity of specific P-type ATPases involved in proton transport. These P-type ATPases are essential for hyperacidification, driving the pH to values considerably lower than in a typical plant vacuole (pH of around 5.5). In petunia, two P-type ATPases (named PH5 and PH1) interact functionally to induce vacuolar hyperacidification and mutants were identified by variation in pH-dependent flower color. 7 The process of hyperacidification is controlled by a transcriptional activation complex formed by an MYB (M) transcription factor, a bHLH (B) transcription factor, and a WD-repeat (W) protein, also involved in regulating proanthocyanin and anthocyanin biosynthesis. 8 , 9 Despite their broad evolutionary distance, a similar mechanism appears to control pH in citrus fruit, where the expression of PH5 correlates with the level of acidity. 10 , 11 Evidence for a conserved regulatory mechanism emerged with the genetic characterization of the “acidless” phenotype, 12 , 13 observed in a peculiar group of citrus mutants where the complete lack of anthocyanins in young leaves and flowers is accompanied by the absence of proanthocyanidins (PAs; also known as condensed tannins) in seeds and, most notably, with an extreme reduction in fruit acidity (involving about two- or three-unit changes in pH compared to the corresponding wild-type accessions). These distinct physiological processes are controlled by a gene with pleiotropic functions encoding a bHLH transcription factor (named Noemi or CitAN1), leading to the hypothesis that the same bHLH and WD-repeat proteins can form three distinct MBW complexes with distinct MYB transcription factors which provide the DNA-binding specificity that drives the MBW complex to the activation of specific promoters and, therefore, to the control of specific processes ( Figure 1 A). 14 Hence, while mutations in the bHLH Noemi gene affect all the three processes, 12 , 13 mutations in a certain MYB genes would only have consequences on one of the three specific phenotypic traits. While the MYB transcription factor, Ruby, has been unequivocally established as the MYB transcription factor that activates anthocyanin biosynthesis in citrus, 15 , 16 , 17 the identity of the genes encoding the other two MYB proteins remains uncertain. The aim of this study was the identification and characterization of those MYB transcription factors controlling PA production in seeds and fruit hyperacidification ( Figure 1 A)."

              "A gene encoding a MYB transcription factor regulating PA biosynthesis in seeds, TT2 , has been extensively characterized in many species including Arabidopsis. 18 , 19 , 20 In citrus, however, the ortholog of TT2 contains mutations including a G/A transition in the start codon conserved in all primary species (mandarin, pummelo, and citron) according to the citrus pangenome ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/ ). We confirmed the presence of the start codon mutations and stop mutations within the first half of the coding sequence of TT2 in citrus primary species and in several hybrids, including sweet orange. Then, we analyzed three genes encoding MYB transcription factors which, based on sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis ( Figure S1 A), appeared related to TT2, clustered within the same subgroup 5a, and therefore had the potential to activate PA biosynthesis. We named them Aris, Marys, and Iris ( Table S1 ). Marys was the most closely related to TT2 and annotated as such in the sweet orange v1.1 Phytozome reference genome ( https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Csinensis_v1_1 ). Iris was highly similar (64% amino acid identity) to VvMYBPA1, a well-characterized transcription factor that regulates PA accumulation in seeds and developing berries of grape. 21 Marys and Iris were highly expressed in the inner seed coat isolated from different varieties of sweet orange ( Figure S1 B). The transcript of Aris was barely detectable, but we were able to isolate the corresponding full-length coding sequence from very young developing fruit. To test the functionality of the three genes, we transiently expressed their coding sequences in leaves of N. benthamiana and treated the extracts with DMACA (4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde) reagent, which specifically stains PAs and their monomers (catechins and epicatechins) a purple-blue color. Only Iris was able to induce the accumulation of these flavonoid compounds ( Figure S1 C). To confirm the functionality, or lack thereof, we used a dual luciferase reporter assay to assess the ability of Aris, Marys, and Iris to activate the promoters of anthocyanidin synthase ( ANS ), a gene essential for PA biosynthesis. Iris strongly activated this promoter, while Aris, Marys showed only very weak, most likely non-specific, activity ( Figure S1 D). When stably expressed in tobacco under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter, Iris was able to induce PA biosynthesis, particularly in flowers ( Figure S1 E). We concluded that Iris is the MYB controlling seed PAs in citrus ( Figure 1 A)."

              "By analogy to petunia, a gene encoding a MYB protein with homology to PhPH4 has been considered the regulator of fruit acidity 13 , 22 , 23 and, recently, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has resulted in edited lines of Fortunella hindsii (Hongkong kumquat), with substantial reduction in fruit acidity and citrate levels. 24 To confirm the identity of the gene encoding the MYB transcription factor controlling hyperacidification of citrus fruits, we searched natural diversity for varieties with a strong reduction in fruit acidity but, unlike “acidless” pleiotropic noemi mutants, still able to produce PAs in seeds. Brazil is one of the world’s largest citrus producers and several varieties of sweet orange with very low acidity are relatively popular and collectively referred to as “Lima” ( Figure S1 F). The most common, simply named “Lima”, is a typical “acidless” variety reported as a noemi mutant 13 ( Figure S1 H). We also examined two less common varieties, “Lima Verde” and “Lima Sorocaba” with very low fruit acidity (pH around 6) and citrate content comparable to the “acidless” noemi mutant ( Figure 1 C), but without any impairment in PA production in seeds ( Figure S1 G).",
              "Sweet orange ( C. sinensis ) is an apomictic hybrid, whose complex pummelo x mandarin genetic constitution is fixed within the population. The absence of sexual recombination and its very narrow genetic base mean that the remarkable phenotypic diversity among accessions results from somatic mutations and that even single polymorphisms in a candidate gene are significant. When analyzed for genes encoding MYB proteins homologous to PhPH4, both “Lima Verde” and “Lima Sorocaba” showed the presence of a defective allele, whose coding sequence was interrupted by a partial LTR retrotransposon of 2,434 bp ( Figures 1 B and S2 A and Data S1 ). We named this gene Nicole . No wild-type allele was detected in the mutants. The absence of a T/G polymorphism downstream of the stop codon ( Figure S2 B) and the localization of Nicole at the 5′ end of chromosome 2 ( Figure S2 C), in an unphased region of apparent mandarin homozygosity, 25 suggest the presence of a terminal deletion affecting the other allele in the mutants. The retrotransposon insertion introduces a premature stop codon that prevents the transcription of the last 188 bp of the Nicole coding sequence, without affecting the 5′ region encoding the DNA-binding domain of the MYB factor but causing a loss of 62 amino acids which include the putative transcriptional activation domain."

              "To characterize further the nicole mutants, we analyzed the accumulation pattern of flavonoids and phenolic acids in fruit juice. Other than a strong reduction in ferulic acid, we could not detect major differences compared to the acidic “Navel” variety ( Figure S2 D).",
              "We then analyzed the transcriptome of the juice vesicles of fruit of three nicole mutants (one accession of “Lima Sorocaba” and two accessions of “Lima Verde” obtained from different sources) and compared these with “Navel” as a wild-type control for acidity, and with the noemi “acidless” mutant “Vaniglia”. 12 We found that a total of 1,151 genes were downregulated ( p value <0.05) in all three nicole mutants, 636 of which were shared by “Vaniglia”, indicating that Nicole and Noemi regulate common processes. Remarkably, the top eight downregulated genes were the same in the two sets of mutants ( Figure 2 A). Among them were PH5 , whose expression was completely abolished in both noemi and nicole mutants and anthocyanin synthase ( ANS ), whose apparently paradoxical expression in fruit of wild-type orange had been reported previously. 26 ANS is exclusively involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and PAs ( Figure S3 A). Generally, anthocyanins are absent in citrus fruit 15 which are also known to lack PAs and their monomers; they are listed as such by USDA, and considered safe for the tannin intolerant. 27 , 28 Our analyses confirmed the absence of PAs in flesh and juice of sweet orange ( Figures S3 B–S3F).",
              "Expression analysis by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) ( Figure 2 B) confirmed that neither of the genes encoding P-type ATPases, PH5 and PH1 , were expressed in the nicole (“Lima Sorocaba”) or noemi (“Vaniglia”) orange mutants, unlike in wild type “Navel”, providing conclusive evidence that fruit hyperacidification is controlled by the Nicole-Noemi complex. ANS displayed a similar behavior, and so did DFR , another structural gene exclusively involved in anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis. A chalcone isomerase-like gene ( CHI-L ) required for efficient accumulation of PAs in Arabidopsis 29 was downregulated in both nicole and noemi mutants. Among other PA biosynthetic genes, we detected no expression of LAR and ANR in fruit of any orange varieties while a gene encoding a PA MATE transporter homologous to TT12 30 was barely expressed in any of the genotypes examined.",
              "Transient transactivation in N. benthamiana using a dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated the ability of the Nicole-Noemi complex to activate the promoters of PH5 , PH1 , ANS , and DFR ( Figure 3 A). The transcription factors had no activity on the ANR promoter. In the same experiments, the truncated version of Nicole (nicole s ) , represented by the coding sequence isolated from “Lima Sorocaba” juice, was only marginally active, confirming the effect of the transposable element insertion on the activity of Nicole . Iris and Noemi activated the ANR promoter of sweet orange ( Figure 3 A), indicating that the accumulation of PAs in the seed coat of sweet orange, including “Lima Sorocaba”and “Lima Verde” is controlled by the Iris-Noemi complex."

              "During the transient assays we also tested the impact of Nicole and Noemi on acidification of leaf tissues, but we found no evidence of a change in pH ( Figures S3 G and S3H) although we did detect the production of significant amounts of PAs by staining crude extracts of leaf tissue around inoculation sites with DMACA ( Figure 3 B). In contrast, the defective Nicole allele was unable to induce the production of DMACA-positive metabolites after transient expression in N. benthamiana . Interestingly, leaves infiltrated with PhPH4 and PhAN1 , the known regulators of vacuolar acidity in petunia, produced the same DMACA-positive stain, which was also induced by the combination of Iris and Noemi ( Figure 3 B).",
              "When stably expressed in N. tabacum , Nicole induced the production of PAs ( Figure S3 I) and, correspondingly, the expression of PA biosynthetic genes ( Figure 3 C). PH5 and PH1 were also strongly upregulated. There was little or no activity on the expression of two genes exclusively involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, 3-GT and PAT ( Figure S3 A), suggesting that Nicole retains its specificity as a PA activator when expressed in tobacco.",
              "Overall, our data in tobacco indicate that the Nicole-Noemi complex directly activates not only PH1 and PH5 , key genes required for vacuolar hyperacidification but also genes involved in PA biosynthesis. However, while the entire PA pathway is activated when Nicole and Noemi are overexpressed in tobacco, only a subset of genes are targets of the complex in sweet orange."

              "In sweet orange, three genes required for PA biosynthesis and accumulation are not expressed in wild-type fruit: LAR , TT12 , and ANR . We hypothesized that, during citrus evolution, one of these genes became irresponsive to the Nicole-Noemi complex, favoring additional mutations to arise in other PA genes whose expression became unnecessary in fruit.",
              "LAR is not essential for PA biosynthesis since it is absent in the genome of some species, such as Arabidopsis, which can still produce PAs, formed exclusively on epicatechin units. Furthermore, LAR is highly expressed in fruit of citron ( C. medica ) and dependent on the activity of Noemi as indicated by the lack of expression in a previously characterized, “acidless” variety 12 ( Figures S4 A and S4B).",
              "The expression of the transporter TT12 is negligible in orange. However, we measured high expression in fruit of trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata ) ( Figures 2 B, S4 C, and S4D), an important species sexually compatible with citrus and now classified as a pure species within the Citrus genus. 31 Trifoliate orange is characterized by very acidic fruit.",
              "ANR is the only PA biosynthetic gene that is not expressed in any of the citrus species tested. Unlike LAR , ANR has been argued to be essential for PA biosynthesis and mutations in this gene result in large reductions in seed coat PAs in Arabidopsis 32 and Medicago. 33 However, it remains unclear whether this is a universal feature in all plants that make PAs. 34",
              "We observed that mature seeds of trifoliate orange are DMACA negative ( Figure S4 E), and the ANR gene is disrupted in this species, where a region of 2.5 kb spanning the last five exons is replaced by a 2.7 kb insertion corresponding to a repetitive element ( Figure S4 F). This observation demonstrated that ANR is essential for PA biosynthesis in this species. These findings suggested that it was the loss of activity of ANR that was the key to the loss of PAs in fruit during citrus evolution. In an ancestral Rutaceae, Nicole may have lost the ability to activate ANR , while retaining its ability to activate other PA biosynthetic genes including PH5 and PH1 . We speculate that the consequent hyperacidification of the vacuole could not be balanced by the H + antiporter activity of TT12, since this transporter is dependent on the production of glycosylated epicatechin PA monomers, 30 , 35 for which ANR is essential 36 ( Figure 4 )."

              "To test this hypothesis, we searched for species related to citrus, within the family Rutaceae, producing fruits which have retained a functional PA biosynthetic pathway and tested whether these had lower fruit acidity than citrus. The genus Citrus belongs to the subfamily Aurantioideae, which is composed of two tribes: Clauseneae and Citreae (to which Citrus belongs) 37 ( Figure S4 G). We obtained fruits from species representative of both tribes, and we tested them for PA production after DMACA staining. As for Citrus , the three species within the Citreae tribe, Atalantia ceylanica , Aegle marmelos , and Severinia buxifolia , produced DMACA-negative fruit, but there was strong staining of fruit from the more distantly related members of the Clauseneae tribe: Glycosmis pentaphylla , Clausena anisata , and Clausena lansium ( Figure S4 H). Fruit of these species had pH in the range 3.7–5.5. We took advantage of the availability of the genome of Clausena lansium 38 to isolate the sequence of the ANR gene and its promoter. The coding sequences shared 95% nucleotide identity with the two ANR alleles of orange but differed considerably in the size of the first intron and in their promoter regions ( Data S2 ). In agreement with the detection of PAs, ANR was expressed in fruit of Clausena lansium in contrast to orange ( Figure S4 I) and, unlike orange, the promoter of ANR from Clausena lansium could be activated by the Nicole-Noemi complex ( Figure 3 A). We propose a model where Citrus may have lost the ability to produce PAs in fruit as a result of a change in the ability of Nicole to activate ANR . The inability to produce PAs and the retention of activation of the proton pumps on the tonoplast may have led to hyperacidification through the failure of the MATE proton antiporter to release the proton gradient in the absence of its cargo ( Figure 4 ). This hyperacidification may have been reinforced by the low expression of DFR and by the loss of Nicole-Noemi activation of TT12 , since the equivalent transcription factors in Arabidopsis, AtMYB5 and TT8 can activate TT12 expression, as well as, at least weakly, activate ANR . 20 The ability to produce PAs in fruit has been retained in distantly related species within the same Aurantinoideae subfamily and is associated with lower fruit acidity."

          "The identification and characterization of natural mutants of sweet orange has provided proof that Nicole encodes a key transcription factor controlling fruit acidity in citrus. Our study uncovered an extensive overlap between fruit acidity and PA biosynthesis.",
          "In seeds, we have identified a different MYB transcription factor, Iris, controlling production of PAs. When overexpressed in tobacco, both Nicole and Iris promote PA accumulation through transcriptional activation of all the biosynthetic genes, but only Nicole strongly upregulates the genes encoding the P-type ATPases PH5 and PH1.",
          "In general, the presence of PAs in seeds is almost a universal feature in higher plants and it does not strictly depend on the activity of PH5 and PH1. In fact, plants that do not have either of the corresponding genes in their genomes, for example tomato, are fully capable of producing seed PAs. Nevertheless, the co-regulation of genes required for vacuolar hyperacidification with those involved in PA biosynthesis is not surprising. In Arabidopsis (which does not have a functional PH1), the gene encoding the P-type ATPase equivalent to PH5, AHA10 , is activated by TT2 during PA biosynthesis, as well as by AtMYB5, encoded by the ortholog of Nicole , which has been reported to regulate PA biosynthesis when expressed in the seed coat, through its ability to partially complement tt2 mutants. 20 This coregulation is plausible since the transport of PA precursors into the vacuole depends on the electrochemical gradient generated by PH5 35 , 39 , 40 required to energize the H + antiporter TT12. Considerable intersection between these two processes has been documented in other species 41 , 42 , 43 including grape, where two homologs of Nicole activate, with different efficiency, partially overlapping sets of genes. 44",
          "In the plant kingdom, the presence of PAs in tissues other than seeds is less common and, according to the analysis of the distribution of PH1 and PH5 among plant species, 45 appears to be strictly associated with the presence of both ATPases. Fruit of many plants as diverse as apple (dicot) and banana (monocot) are known for their PA content and so the receptacle of strawberry and the leaves of some legumes. All these plant species contains both PH1 and PH5 , causing vacuolar hyperacification which may be required not only for the transport of PA monomers across the tonoplast but also for their condensation into polymeric PAs, the final and yet poorly understood step in PA biosynthesis. 34",
          "Citrus fruit, despite having a functional PA pathway, PH1 , PH5 , and expressing Nicole , the essential regulator of both sets of genes, do not produce fruit PAs. We associated this feature with the inability to activate ANR , the only PA biosynthetic gene for which we could not detect expression in any of the citrus fruit analyzed. The activation of ANR by the Nicole-Noemi complex has been retained in fruit of distant citrus relative which, accordingly, accumulate PAs and are also characterized by lower fruit acidity compared to citrus.",
          "We speculate that, in citrus, loss of ANR activity in fruit juice vesicles results in vacuole hyperacidification that is not counteracted by the import of PA precursors. Since plant vacuolar pH is tightly homeostatically regulated, other mechanisms must be in place to ensure that the very steep electrochemical H + gradient across the tonoplast is maintained during fruit ripening. Our study, however, indicates that loss of induction of PA biosynthesis may be an integral component of the hyperacidification mechanism in citrus fruit."

Although the results presented are consistent with this hypothesis, we do not have direct evidence to support our model ( Figure 4 B). In particular, we could not establish that lack of ANR activity prevents the efflux of protons induced for PA antiport into the vacuoles of juice sacs, resulting in their hyperacidification. The generation of a knockout anr mutant in N. benthamiana followed by overexpression of Nicole and Noemi provided inconclusive results because of a failure of the mutation to inhibit PA accumulation. Further attempts to measure the vacuolar pH in the cells of the inner seed coat of an anr mutant of Arabidopsis were unsuccessful because the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye used was unable to permeate this cell layer."

For HPLC analysis, PAs were extracted from fruit of different sweet orange varieties and, as controls, from grape skin and transgenic N. tabacum plants generated in this study. Samples were extracted twice with 10 vol. of an extraction solution, containing 70% (v/v) acetone and 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid, and sonication at room temperature for 30 min. Extractions were centrifugated at 8,000 rpm for 10 min and supernatants containing soluble PAs were pooled. Soluble PA samples were washed three times with chloroform, and a further three times with hexane, before freeze-drying overnight. PA powder was resuspended in 1 mL extraction solution per 1 g of fresh starting material. The extracts were diluted 5-fold in H 2 O and run on a Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC with Prominence diode array detector (UV/vis absorbance) and a 2020 single quad mass spectrometer.

    "full_text": "Introduction Citrus fruits are well known for their acidity and, with a pH of around 2, lemon is the most acidic common constituent of the human diet. Many wild and cultivated citrus species and hybrids (including citron, most limes, “true” mandarins, trifoliate, and sour orange) share similarly high levels of acidity. The acidity of citrus fruit may have underpinned early uses as medicine and antiseptics. However, thousands of years of domestication have resulted in accessions with moderate acidity with a typical pH of around 3.5 for some mandarins and sweet orange fruit. Together with total soluble sugars, acidity is the major determinant of taste and quality of citrus fruit. The very low pH reflects the content of citric acid (citrate), which is produced within the juice vesicles, the unique structures that form the edible part of citrus fruit. 1 , 2 At the cellular level, citrate biosynthesis requires the coordinated activity of many enzymes in different compartments. It is generally assumed that reduced acidity was a key trait for citrus domestication, and genetic differences in citrate biosynthetic genes may explain differences in acidity between wild and cultivated citrus and between lemon and orange. 3 , 4 Besides biosynthesis and degradation, a key step in citrate metabolism is its transport to the vacuole. The current understanding is that this process is achieved through a mechanism referred to as the “acid trap,” dependent on the pH of the vacuole and the electrochemical H + gradient across the tonoplast. 5 , 6 Acidification of the vacuole can be achieved through the activity of vacuolar pyrophosphatases and vacuolar ATPases, proton pumps ubiquitous in plants. In some species including citrus, however, a second distinct mechanism has been identified which requires the activity of specific P-type ATPases involved in proton transport. These P-type ATPases are essential for hyperacidification, driving the pH to values considerably lower than in a typical plant vacuole (pH of around 5.5). In petunia, two P-type ATPases (named PH5 and PH1) interact functionally to induce vacuolar hyperacidification and mutants were identified by variation in pH-dependent flower color. 7 The process of hyperacidification is controlled by a transcriptional activation complex formed by an MYB (M) transcription factor, a bHLH (B) transcription factor, and a WD-repeat (W) protein, also involved in regulating proanthocyanin and anthocyanin biosynthesis. 8 , 9 Despite their broad evolutionary distance, a similar mechanism appears to control pH in citrus fruit, where the expression of PH5 correlates with the level of acidity. 10 , 11 Evidence for a conserved regulatory mechanism emerged with the genetic characterization of the “acidless” phenotype, 12 , 13 observed in a peculiar group of citrus mutants where the complete lack of anthocyanins in young leaves and flowers is accompanied by the absence of proanthocyanidins (PAs; also known as condensed tannins) in seeds and, most notably, with an extreme reduction in fruit acidity (involving about two- or three-unit changes in pH compared to the corresponding wild-type accessions). These distinct physiological processes are controlled by a gene with pleiotropic functions encoding a bHLH transcription factor (named Noemi or CitAN1), leading to the hypothesis that the same bHLH and WD-repeat proteins can form three distinct MBW complexes with distinct MYB transcription factors which provide the DNA-binding specificity that drives the MBW complex to the activation of specific promoters and, therefore, to the control of specific processes ( Figure 1 A). 14 Hence, while mutations in the bHLH Noemi gene affect all the three processes, 12 , 13 mutations in a certain MYB genes would only have consequences on one of the three specific phenotypic traits. While the MYB transcription factor, Ruby, has been unequivocally established as the MYB transcription factor that activates anthocyanin biosynthesis in citrus, 15 , 16 , 17 the identity of the genes encoding the other two MYB proteins remains uncertain. The aim of this study was the identification and characterization of those MYB transcription factors controlling PA production in seeds and fruit hyperacidification ( Figure 1 A). Results Isolation of Iris, MYB regulator of PA biosynthesis in seeds of sweet orange A gene encoding a MYB transcription factor regulating PA biosynthesis in seeds, TT2 , has been extensively characterized in many species including Arabidopsis. 18 , 19 , 20 In citrus, however, the ortholog of TT2 contains mutations including a G/A transition in the start codon conserved in all primary species (mandarin, pummelo, and citron) according to the citrus pangenome ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/ ). We confirmed the presence of the start codon mutations and stop mutations within the first half of the coding sequence of TT2 in citrus primary species and in several hybrids, including sweet orange. Then, we analyzed three genes encoding MYB transcription factors which, based on sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis ( Figure S1 A), appeared related to TT2, clustered within the same subgroup 5a, and therefore had the potential to activate PA biosynthesis. We named them Aris, Marys, and Iris ( Table S1 ). Marys was the most closely related to TT2 and annotated as such in the sweet orange v1.1 Phytozome reference genome ( https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Csinensis_v1_1 ). Iris was highly similar (64% amino acid identity) to VvMYBPA1, a well-characterized transcription factor that regulates PA accumulation in seeds and developing berries of grape. 21 Marys and Iris were highly expressed in the inner seed coat isolated from different varieties of sweet orange ( Figure S1 B). The transcript of Aris was barely detectable, but we were able to isolate the corresponding full-length coding sequence from very young developing fruit. To test the functionality of the three genes, we transiently expressed their coding sequences in leaves of N. benthamiana and treated the extracts with DMACA (4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde) reagent, which specifically stains PAs and their monomers (catechins and epicatechins) a purple-blue color. Only Iris was able to induce the accumulation of these flavonoid compounds ( Figure S1 C). To confirm the functionality, or lack thereof, we used a dual luciferase reporter assay to assess the ability of Aris, Marys, and Iris to activate the promoters of anthocyanidin synthase ( ANS ), a gene essential for PA biosynthesis. Iris strongly activated this promoter, while Aris, Marys showed only very weak, most likely non-specific, activity ( Figure S1 D). When stably expressed in tobacco under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter, Iris was able to induce PA biosynthesis, particularly in flowers ( Figure S1 E). We concluded that Iris is the MYB controlling seed PAs in citrus ( Figure 1 A). Isolation of Nicole, MYB regulator of fruit acidity in sweet orange By analogy to petunia, a gene encoding a MYB protein with homology to PhPH4 has been considered the regulator of fruit acidity 13 , 22 , 23 and, recently, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has resulted in edited lines of Fortunella hindsii (Hongkong kumquat), with substantial reduction in fruit acidity and citrate levels. 24 To confirm the identity of the gene encoding the MYB transcription factor controlling hyperacidification of citrus fruits, we searched natural diversity for varieties with a strong reduction in fruit acidity but, unlike “acidless” pleiotropic noemi mutants, still able to produce PAs in seeds. Brazil is one of the world’s largest citrus producers and several varieties of sweet orange with very low acidity are relatively popular and collectively referred to as “Lima” ( Figure S1 F). The most common, simply named “Lima”, is a typical “acidless” variety reported as a noemi mutant 13 ( Figure S1 H). We also examined two less common varieties, “Lima Verde” and “Lima Sorocaba” with very low fruit acidity (pH around 6) and citrate content comparable to the “acidless” noemi mutant ( Figure 1 C), but without any impairment in PA production in seeds ( Figure S1 G). Sweet orange ( C. sinensis ) is an apomictic hybrid, whose complex pummelo x mandarin genetic constitution is fixed within the population. The absence of sexual recombination and its very narrow genetic base mean that the remarkable phenotypic diversity among accessions results from somatic mutations and that even single polymorphisms in a candidate gene are significant. When analyzed for genes encoding MYB proteins homologous to PhPH4, both “Lima Verde” and “Lima Sorocaba” showed the presence of a defective allele, whose coding sequence was interrupted by a partial LTR retrotransposon of 2,434 bp ( Figures 1 B and S2 A and Data S1 ). We named this gene Nicole . No wild-type allele was detected in the mutants. The absence of a T/G polymorphism downstream of the stop codon ( Figure S2 B) and the localization of Nicole at the 5′ end of chromosome 2 ( Figure S2 C), in an unphased region of apparent mandarin homozygosity, 25 suggest the presence of a terminal deletion affecting the other allele in the mutants. The retrotransposon insertion introduces a premature stop codon that prevents the transcription of the last 188 bp of the Nicole coding sequence, without affecting the 5′ region encoding the DNA-binding domain of the MYB factor but causing a loss of 62 amino acids which include the putative transcriptional activation domain. Nicole directly activates the expression of genes required for vacuolar hyperacidification and biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins, which are absent in citrus fruit To characterize further the nicole mutants, we analyzed the accumulation pattern of flavonoids and phenolic acids in fruit juice. Other than a strong reduction in ferulic acid, we could not detect major differences compared to the acidic “Navel” variety ( Figure S2 D). We then analyzed the transcriptome of the juice vesicles of fruit of three nicole mutants (one accession of “Lima Sorocaba” and two accessions of “Lima Verde” obtained from different sources) and compared these with “Navel” as a wild-type control for acidity, and with the noemi “acidless” mutant “Vaniglia”. 12 We found that a total of 1,151 genes were downregulated ( p value <0.05) in all three nicole mutants, 636 of which were shared by “Vaniglia”, indicating that Nicole and Noemi regulate common processes. Remarkably, the top eight downregulated genes were the same in the two sets of mutants ( Figure 2 A). Among them were PH5 , whose expression was completely abolished in both noemi and nicole mutants and anthocyanin synthase ( ANS ), whose apparently paradoxical expression in fruit of wild-type orange had been reported previously. 26 ANS is exclusively involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and PAs ( Figure S3 A). Generally, anthocyanins are absent in citrus fruit 15 which are also known to lack PAs and their monomers; they are listed as such by USDA, and considered safe for the tannin intolerant. 27 , 28 Our analyses confirmed the absence of PAs in flesh and juice of sweet orange ( Figures S3 B–S3F). Expression analysis by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) ( Figure 2 B) confirmed that neither of the genes encoding P-type ATPases, PH5 and PH1 , were expressed in the nicole (“Lima Sorocaba”) or noemi (“Vaniglia”) orange mutants, unlike in wild type “Navel”, providing conclusive evidence that fruit hyperacidification is controlled by the Nicole-Noemi complex. ANS displayed a similar behavior, and so did DFR , another structural gene exclusively involved in anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis. A chalcone isomerase-like gene ( CHI-L ) required for efficient accumulation of PAs in Arabidopsis 29 was downregulated in both nicole and noemi mutants. Among other PA biosynthetic genes, we detected no expression of LAR and ANR in fruit of any orange varieties while a gene encoding a PA MATE transporter homologous to TT12 30 was barely expressed in any of the genotypes examined. Transient transactivation in N. benthamiana using a dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated the ability of the Nicole-Noemi complex to activate the promoters of PH5 , PH1 , ANS , and DFR ( Figure 3 A). The transcription factors had no activity on the ANR promoter. In the same experiments, the truncated version of Nicole (nicole s ) , represented by the coding sequence isolated from “Lima Sorocaba” juice, was only marginally active, confirming the effect of the transposable element insertion on the activity of Nicole . Iris and Noemi activated the ANR promoter of sweet orange ( Figure 3 A), indicating that the accumulation of PAs in the seed coat of sweet orange, including “Lima Sorocaba”and “Lima Verde” is controlled by the Iris-Noemi complex. Nicole induces proanthocyanidin accumulation when expressed in tobacco During the transient assays we also tested the impact of Nicole and Noemi on acidification of leaf tissues, but we found no evidence of a change in pH ( Figures S3 G and S3H) although we did detect the production of significant amounts of PAs by staining crude extracts of leaf tissue around inoculation sites with DMACA ( Figure 3 B). In contrast, the defective Nicole allele was unable to induce the production of DMACA-positive metabolites after transient expression in N. benthamiana . Interestingly, leaves infiltrated with PhPH4 and PhAN1 , the known regulators of vacuolar acidity in petunia, produced the same DMACA-positive stain, which was also induced by the combination of Iris and Noemi ( Figure 3 B). When stably expressed in N. tabacum , Nicole induced the production of PAs ( Figure S3 I) and, correspondingly, the expression of PA biosynthetic genes ( Figure 3 C). PH5 and PH1 were also strongly upregulated. There was little or no activity on the expression of two genes exclusively involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, 3-GT and PAT ( Figure S3 A), suggesting that Nicole retains its specificity as a PA activator when expressed in tobacco. Overall, our data in tobacco indicate that the Nicole-Noemi complex directly activates not only PH1 and PH5 , key genes required for vacuolar hyperacidification but also genes involved in PA biosynthesis. However, while the entire PA pathway is activated when Nicole and Noemi are overexpressed in tobacco, only a subset of genes are targets of the complex in sweet orange. ANR , a gene essential for proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, is not expressed in fruit of sweet orange In sweet orange, three genes required for PA biosynthesis and accumulation are not expressed in wild-type fruit: LAR , TT12 , and ANR . We hypothesized that, during citrus evolution, one of these genes became irresponsive to the Nicole-Noemi complex, favoring additional mutations to arise in other PA genes whose expression became unnecessary in fruit. LAR is not essential for PA biosynthesis since it is absent in the genome of some species, such as Arabidopsis, which can still produce PAs, formed exclusively on epicatechin units. Furthermore, LAR is highly expressed in fruit of citron ( C. medica ) and dependent on the activity of Noemi as indicated by the lack of expression in a previously characterized, “acidless” variety 12 ( Figures S4 A and S4B). The expression of the transporter TT12 is negligible in orange. However, we measured high expression in fruit of trifoliate orange ( Poncirus trifoliata ) ( Figures 2 B, S4 C, and S4D), an important species sexually compatible with citrus and now classified as a pure species within the Citrus genus. 31 Trifoliate orange is characterized by very acidic fruit. ANR is the only PA biosynthetic gene that is not expressed in any of the citrus species tested. Unlike LAR , ANR has been argued to be essential for PA biosynthesis and mutations in this gene result in large reductions in seed coat PAs in Arabidopsis 32 and Medicago. 33 However, it remains unclear whether this is a universal feature in all plants that make PAs. 34 We observed that mature seeds of trifoliate orange are DMACA negative ( Figure S4 E), and the ANR gene is disrupted in this species, where a region of 2.5 kb spanning the last five exons is replaced by a 2.7 kb insertion corresponding to a repetitive element ( Figure S4 F). This observation demonstrated that ANR is essential for PA biosynthesis in this species. These findings suggested that it was the loss of activity of ANR that was the key to the loss of PAs in fruit during citrus evolution. In an ancestral Rutaceae, Nicole may have lost the ability to activate ANR , while retaining its ability to activate other PA biosynthetic genes including PH5 and PH1 . We speculate that the consequent hyperacidification of the vacuole could not be balanced by the H + antiporter activity of TT12, since this transporter is dependent on the production of glycosylated epicatechin PA monomers, 30 , 35 for which ANR is essential 36 ( Figure 4 ). ANR is expressed in fruit of distant citrus relatives, which also accumulates proanthocyanidins To test this hypothesis, we searched for species related to citrus, within the family Rutaceae, producing fruits which have retained a functional PA biosynthetic pathway and tested whether these had lower fruit acidity than citrus. The genus Citrus belongs to the subfamily Aurantioideae, which is composed of two tribes: Clauseneae and Citreae (to which Citrus belongs) 37 ( Figure S4 G). We obtained fruits from species representative of both tribes, and we tested them for PA production after DMACA staining. As for Citrus , the three species within the Citreae tribe, Atalantia ceylanica , Aegle marmelos , and Severinia buxifolia , produced DMACA-negative fruit, but there was strong staining of fruit from the more distantly related members of the Clauseneae tribe: Glycosmis pentaphylla , Clausena anisata , and Clausena lansium ( Figure S4 H). Fruit of these species had pH in the range 3.7–5.5. We took advantage of the availability of the genome of Clausena lansium 38 to isolate the sequence of the ANR gene and its promoter. The coding sequences shared 95% nucleotide identity with the two ANR alleles of orange but differed considerably in the size of the first intron and in their promoter regions ( Data S2 ). In agreement with the detection of PAs, ANR was expressed in fruit of Clausena lansium in contrast to orange ( Figure S4 I) and, unlike orange, the promoter of ANR from Clausena lansium could be activated by the Nicole-Noemi complex ( Figure 3 A). We propose a model where Citrus may have lost the ability to produce PAs in fruit as a result of a change in the ability of Nicole to activate ANR . The inability to produce PAs and the retention of activation of the proton pumps on the tonoplast may have led to hyperacidification through the failure of the MATE proton antiporter to release the proton gradient in the absence of its cargo ( Figure 4 ). This hyperacidification may have been reinforced by the low expression of DFR and by the loss of Nicole-Noemi activation of TT12 , since the equivalent transcription factors in Arabidopsis, AtMYB5 and TT8 can activate TT12 expression, as well as, at least weakly, activate ANR . 20 The ability to produce PAs in fruit has been retained in distantly related species within the same Aurantinoideae subfamily and is associated with lower fruit acidity. Discussion The identification and characterization of natural mutants of sweet orange has provided proof that Nicole encodes a key transcription factor controlling fruit acidity in citrus. Our study uncovered an extensive overlap between fruit acidity and PA biosynthesis. In seeds, we have identified a different MYB transcription factor, Iris, controlling production of PAs. When overexpressed in tobacco, both Nicole and Iris promote PA accumulation through transcriptional activation of all the biosynthetic genes, but only Nicole strongly upregulates the genes encoding the P-type ATPases PH5 and PH1. In general, the presence of PAs in seeds is almost a universal feature in higher plants and it does not strictly depend on the activity of PH5 and PH1. In fact, plants that do not have either of the corresponding genes in their genomes, for example tomato, are fully capable of producing seed PAs. Nevertheless, the co-regulation of genes required for vacuolar hyperacidification with those involved in PA biosynthesis is not surprising. In Arabidopsis (which does not have a functional PH1), the gene encoding the P-type ATPase equivalent to PH5, AHA10 , is activated by TT2 during PA biosynthesis, as well as by AtMYB5, encoded by the ortholog of Nicole , which has been reported to regulate PA biosynthesis when expressed in the seed coat, through its ability to partially complement tt2 mutants. 20 This coregulation is plausible since the transport of PA precursors into the vacuole depends on the electrochemical gradient generated by PH5 35 , 39 , 40 required to energize the H + antiporter TT12. Considerable intersection between these two processes has been documented in other species 41 , 42 , 43 including grape, where two homologs of Nicole activate, with different efficiency, partially overlapping sets of genes. 44 In the plant kingdom, the presence of PAs in tissues other than seeds is less common and, according to the analysis of the distribution of PH1 and PH5 among plant species, 45 appears to be strictly associated with the presence of both ATPases. Fruit of many plants as diverse as apple (dicot) and banana (monocot) are known for their PA content and so the receptacle of strawberry and the leaves of some legumes. All these plant species contains both PH1 and PH5 , causing vacuolar hyperacification which may be required not only for the transport of PA monomers across the tonoplast but also for their condensation into polymeric PAs, the final and yet poorly understood step in PA biosynthesis. 34 Citrus fruit, despite having a functional PA pathway, PH1 , PH5 , and expressing Nicole , the essential regulator of both sets of genes, do not produce fruit PAs. We associated this feature with the inability to activate ANR , the only PA biosynthetic gene for which we could not detect expression in any of the citrus fruit analyzed. The activation of ANR by the Nicole-Noemi complex has been retained in fruit of distant citrus relative which, accordingly, accumulate PAs and are also characterized by lower fruit acidity compared to citrus. We speculate that, in citrus, loss of ANR activity in fruit juice vesicles results in vacuole hyperacidification that is not counteracted by the import of PA precursors. Since plant vacuolar pH is tightly homeostatically regulated, other mechanisms must be in place to ensure that the very steep electrochemical H + gradient across the tonoplast is maintained during fruit ripening. Our study, however, indicates that loss of induction of PA biosynthesis may be an integral component of the hyperacidification mechanism in citrus fruit. Limitations of the study We propose an evolutionary scenario where the molecular mechanism required for the extreme hyperacidification in citrus fruit may have been co-opted from the proanthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. Although the results presented are consistent with this hypothesis, we do not have direct evidence to support our model ( Figure 4 B). In particular, we could not establish that lack of ANR activity prevents the efflux of protons induced for PA antiport into the vacuoles of juice sacs, resulting in their hyperacidification. The generation of a knockout anr mutant in N. benthamiana followed by overexpression of Nicole and Noemi provided inconclusive results because of a failure of the mutation to inhibit PA accumulation. Further attempts to measure the vacuolar pH in the cells of the inner seed coat of an anr mutant of Arabidopsis were unsuccessful because the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye used was unable to permeate this cell layer.

Transgenic tobacco plants were obtained in the Samsun NN line of Nicotiana tabacum and kept in greenhouse conditions. Greenhouses were kept to 20 o C in the day and 16 o C at night. Supplemental lighting was used in winter months, maintaining a 16-h day. Method details Plant material “Navel” and “Valencia” are acidic sweet orange varieties, wild type for acidity used as comparative controls. For RNA-seq analysis, ripe fruit of one “Navel” accession were obtained from CREA (Acireale, Italy). The other biological replicates of “Navel” oranges were obtained from a local supermarket in Norwich (Tesco). “Valencia” fruits were obtained from a local supermarket in Norwich (Waitrose). “Vaniglia” fruits for all the biological replicates were obtained from CREA. “Lima Sorocaba” was obtained from a local market in São Paulo region, Brazil. “Lima Verde” fruits were obtained from Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo (R1) and Mogi Guaçu (R2). Fruits of Severinia buxifolia were obtained from CREA. The remaining distant citrus relatives were obtained from Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA, Valencia, Spain). P. trifoliata plant material was obtained from a tree in Norwich, grown from seeds collected at CREA. pH and citric acid analyses Fruit juice was obtained using a conventional citrus squeezer from fruits of sweet orange and P. trifoliata and with a plastic pestle from fruit of distant citrus relatives. After centrifugation, pH of juice was measured using a standard combination Ag/AgCl pH electrode in at least three fruits per variety. Citric acid in different sweet orange varieties was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) as described by Lin et al. 52 Three biological replicates, obtained from individual fruits, were used except for “Navel” where only two samples were available. Isolation of N icole alleles Full-length Nicole alleles were isolated by PCR using primers PH4-FA and PH4-RZ ( Table S2 ) designed close to start and stop codons of the gene. DNA was isolated from leaves or fruit of different sweet orange varieties using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). PCR fragments were used directly for sequencing. Appropriate primers were used to obtain the complete sequences and confirm the presence of the retrotransposon. All the sequences obtained were compared to those available in different citrus genome assemblies listed in the key resources table . Phylogenetic analysis of citrus MYB transcription factors Genome-wide analyses of R2R3-MYB proteins in the sweet orange v1.1 Phytozome reference genome were performed by protein sequence analyses, multiple sequence alignments, and subsequent phylogenetic tree construction. Other proteins from different species were also included: 125 R2R3-MYBs from Arabidopsis and characterised R2R3-MYBs from V. vinifera ( n = 5), P. hybrida ( n = 2), L. chinensis ( n = 2), M. truncatula ( n = 3), M. domestica ( n = 4), P. persica ( n = 3), G. max ( n = 1) and F. ananassa ( n = 1). Initially, candidate genes encoding MYB TFs were identified by reference genome amino acid sequence analysis of PFAM domains PF00249 (Myb-like DNA binding domain). Candidate sweet orange MYB-like TFs containing two predicted MYB domains were selected and designated as R2R3-CsMYBs ( Table S1 ). The maximum-likelihood (ML) substitution model that best described each alignment was determined using PhyML. 48 Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the best substitution model with RAxML 49 (1,000 bootstrap replicates). RNA extraction from sweet orange fruit and sequencing RNA from sweet orange fruits of different varieties was extracted as previously reported 53 and further purified using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were sent to Novogene for low input PE150 Illumina sequencing. Novogene conducted the initial analyses, providing FPKM values for all genes in all samples and significance values when compared to expression in wild type “Navel” fruit juice. R (v4.0.5) was used to generate lists of differentially expressed genes in all the mutant varieties and GO enrichment analyses using R package topGO. 50 For comparative differential expression analyses between wild type and ‘acidless’ noemi mutant or the combined three nicole mutants, read counts were analyzed using the interactive web-tool DEGUST using the Voom function from limma package methodo methodology. 51 Real-time quantitative PCR analysis Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to validate RNA-seq transcriptomic data and to analyze gene expression in transgenic tobacco. For sweet orange, total RNA was extracted as described above, treated with DNAse I (Roche) and retrotranscribed using Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT-qPCR primers were designed to span exon-exon junctions or were separated by large introns to avoid amplification of residual DNA contamination and tested for primer efficiency. Reactions were conducted using the SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix Kit (Sigma) with the X96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Biorad). Three biological and three technical replicates were used for each variety of sweet orange. For conventional RT-PCR, first-strand cDNA was obtained as described above and amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher) and primers indicated in Table S2 . DNA bands were sequenced to confirm correct exon-exon junctions. Transient expression in N. Benthamiana and dual luciferase assay The effect of different transcription factors on PA production and promoter activation was assessed by transient expression via agroinfiltration of leaves of N. benthamiana . Effector plasmids encoding transcription factors from sweet orange were obtained by PCR amplification using cDNA from fruit of sweet orange or petals of petunia (V26) and primers listed in Table S2 . The coding sequences were first cloned into the pDONR207 entry clone (Thermo Fisher) and subsequently transferred to the destination vector pEAQ-HT-DEST1 46 designed for Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). The reporter constructs were obtained by PCR amplification of different promoters followed by restriction enzyme cloning into the pGreen II 0800-LUC vector 47 to control the expression of the firefly-derived luciferase reporter gene. This vector also contained a Renilla luciferase gene under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter as an internal control to normalise the values of the experimental reporter gene. Effector and reporter plasmids were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. Reporter plasmids were co-transformed with the helper plasmid pSoup. Liquid cultures were grown overnight with appropriate antibiotic selection and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed and resuspended in 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MES pH 5.6, 200 μM acetosyringone to A 600 = 0.1 for effector and A 600 = 0.2 for reporter constructs. A. tumefaciens suspensions were infiltrated into the abaxial surface of expanded leaves of N. benthamiana . For each combination, five injected areas were treated as biological replicates. Agroinfiltrated leaves were harvested after 3 days, and luciferase activity was measured immediately using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega). Leaf discs of 4 mm in diameter were collected in 1.5 mL white transparent tubes containing 100 μL of PBS. A volume of 75 μL of luciferase assay reagent was added and firefly luminescence was measured on a Glomax 20/20 single tube luminometer (Promega) after 10 min. Renilla luminescence was measured on the same instrument 10 min after the addition to the same sample of 75 μL of Stop & Glo reagent. Results were expressed as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity (Luc/Ren). pH imaging in N. Benthamiana The method employed a non-fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (6-CFDA, Sigma-Aldrich) which is cleaved by non-specific vacuolar esterases releasing the fluorescent dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-CF), which has a pH-dependent ratio of emission intensities at different excitation wavelengths. Two days after agroinfiltration, leaf discs were infiltrated with pH staining solution (20 μM 6-CFDA in MS liquid medium). Leaf discs were collected after 24 h and incubated with 13.3 μM 6-carboxyfluorescein di acetate (6-CFDA), 0.3% Triton X-100 in MS liquid medium. Images were captured using a Leica SP5 Confocal Stereo Microscope equipped with an HC PL APO CS2 20x/0.75 air objective (Leica Microsystems GmbH). The absorbance emission derived from 458 nm to 488 nm excitation lasers was measured and the 488/458 nm emission ratio was calculated and compared with a calibration curve obtained with 6-CF dye in buffers with different known pH. Stable transformation in N. tabacum and expression analysis The coding sequences of different regulatory genes were obtained as described above and cloned into pJAM 1502, a pBin19-derived binary vector equipped with a double CaMV 35S promoter and a CaMV terminator with attR recombination sites in between, using Gateway cloning technology. The resulting plasmids were transferred to A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 and used to transform N. tabacum cv Samsun NN. Plants transformed with the empty pJAM 1502 were used as a control. For gene expression analysis, total RNA was extracted using an optimised cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based protocol 54 to minimise the binding of PAs to RNA. Sepals were used for the lines expressing individual regulatory genes and leaves for co-expressing lines, since 35S::Nicole - 35S::Noemi plants did not produce any flowers. RT-qPCR was conducted as described above. Three biological and three technical replicates were used for each transgenic plant. For the biological replicates, at least two independent transformants or, for the double overexpressors, two independent crosses between different transformants were used for each genotype. Localisation and quantification of proantocyanidins The presence of proanthocyanidins in seeds, fruit, leaves, and flowers was determined by staining with 0.3% (w/v) DMACA (4-Dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde, Sigma) in methanol and 6 M HCl (1:1, v/v) followed by several washing steps with 70% ethanol. For N. tabacum leaves and flowers, samples were first destained overnight in a solution of ethanol-glacial acetic acid (3:1, v/v). For transient expression in N. benthamiana , freeze-dried leaf samples were extracted with 80% methanol overnight and 0.5 vol. of 0.3% DMACA reagent was added. In presence of PAs or their monomers, the solution initially quickly turned blue-green, then purple. If the compounds were not present, the solution remained yellow. For HPLC analysis, PAs were extracted from fruit of different sweet orange varieties and, as controls, from grape skin and transgenic N. tabacum plants generated in this study. Samples were extracted twice with 10 vol. of an extraction solution, containing 70% (v/v) acetone and 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid, and sonication at room temperature for 30 min. Extractions were centrifugated at 8,000 rpm for 10 min and supernatants containing soluble PAs were pooled. Soluble PA samples were washed three times with chloroform, and a further three times with hexane, before freeze-drying overnight. PA powder was resuspended in 1 mL extraction solution per 1 g of fresh starting material. The extracts were diluted 5-fold in H 2 O and run on a Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC with Prominence diode array detector (UV/vis absorbance) and a 2020 single quad mass spectrometer. Separation was on a 50 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm particle size Kinetex EVO C18 column (Phenomenex) using a gradient of acetonitrile versus 0.1% (w/v) formic acid in H 2 O, run at 0.6 mL min −1 at 40°C. Detection was by UV absorbance collecting full spectra from 200 to 600 nm at 12.5 Hz with a time constant of 0.08 s, and by positive mode electrospray MS. The mass spec collected full spectra from m/z 100–900 in 0.1 s and monitored m/z 291(+) by single-ion-monitoring for 50 msec. Spray chamber conditions were 250°C desorbation line, 200°C heat block, 1.5 L min −1 nebulizer gas, and 15 L min −1 drying gas. The injection volume was 5 μL. Flavan-3-ol monomers were quantified at 279 nm by calibration against (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin standard curves. Following acid-catalysis of soluble PA extracts, flavan-3-ol terminal subunits from PA polymers were released in addition to extension subunits. Terminal subunit concentration was determined by the subtraction of free flavan-3-ol monomer concentration in uncleaved PA samples from the total flavan-3-ol monomer concentration in the acid-catalysed samples. Quantification and statistical analysis Bar plots were generated using GraphPad Prism 10 and Excel version 2308. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean (SD). Asterisks indicate comparative statistical significance relative to “Navel“ calculated by unpaired Student’s t test. The number of the replicates assayed is described in the STAR Methods and in the figure legends.
