    "full_text": "Inducing natural resistance against pathogen infection in postharvest citrus by exogenous elicitor is a promising alternative to reduce postharvest losses. Here, the potential induced resistance mechanism of blended cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol and eugenol nano-emulsion against P. digitatum in ‘Newhall’ navel orange ( Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) was evaluated through combined transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis. Application of nano-emulsion maintained fruit firmness after P. digitatum inoculation, nano-emulsion reduced H 2 O 2 and MDA accumulation of citrus fruit, increased PAL, C4H, 4CL and CAD activity, and higher contents of flavonoids, lignin and total phenolic compounds. Furthermore, higher activities of SOD, CAT, POD and APX in nano-emulsion treated fruit possibly benefited reducing ROS accumulation and lipid peroxidation. The activities of the defense enzymes CHI, GLU were higher in the nano-emulsion treated fruits. RNA-seq identified 653 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and the nano-emulsion-treated fruit at 48 hpi, including 444 up-regulated and 209 downregulated genes. Genes encoding shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase / acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (COMT), cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD) were differentially expressed by nano-emulsion treatment. In addition, 175 differential accumulated metabolites between the control and the nano-emulsion-treated fruit at 48 hpi also were identified, the different accumulated metabolites from phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway related with disease resistance including L -phenylalanine, caffeic acid, caffeoyl quinic acid, coniferyl alcohol, coniferaldehyde. The integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were mainly involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. Besides, the nano-emulsion significantly induced accumulation of primary metabolites including amino acids, soluble sugars, organic acids, lipids, sugar and alcohols. All these results indicated that blended essential oil nano-emulsion as an antifungal delivery system to induce resistance against P. digitatum infection of ‘Newhall’ navel orange by promoting phenylpropanoid metabolism."

          "Citrus fruits are vulnerable to pathogen infection after harvest, one alternative strategy to control postharvest pathogen proposed by many researchers is that the application of some exogenous elicitors could induce resistance which play a role to against pathogen infection ( Walters et al., 2013 ). Excessive quantity resistance inducer would not be proposed due to consumer concern regarding organoleptic quality, environment safety and human health concern. Furthermore, some inducer materials tend to be decomposed before to function in crops. Nano-emulsion based encapsulation system can overcome essential oil’s hydrophobicity, volatility and improve bioavailability ( Khot et al., 2012 ). They have been extensively applied in postharvest preservation and pathogen control.",
          "Although previous research revealed the induced resistance by the elicitor application response in citrus fruit ( Wu et al., 2017 ), the integrated transcriptome with metabolome associated with induced resistance research is still in its infancy. Fruit can initiate endogenous defence mechansim through primary and secondary metabolites changes against pathogen infection. Plant metabolites is closely associated with phenotype, profiling regarding metabolites variation of induced resistance can give us intuitively illustrations than transcriptomics. By transcriptomics together with metabolomics technology, the significantly enriched genes, metabolites and pathway involved in fruit defense can be identified. Combined transcriptomics with metabolomics regarding induced resistance of fruit interaction with pathogen is still more researcher’s interests. The strategy of combining transcriptomics and metabolomic can help us understand the relationship between the changes of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in citrus fruits and the subsequent changes in metabolites under the action of exogenous inducers, and illustrate its disease resistance mechanism.",
          "In the previous work, the authors found that cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol have strong antifungal activity against P. digitatum ( Wan et al., 2017, 2019 ). In this work, a combination of essential oil cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol and eugenol were encapsulated in a stable nano-emulsion. The author hypothesized that use of this stable nano-emulsion would confer resistance to ‘Newhall’ navel orange against P. digitatum infection. The findings from this study will provide important inferences for the exploitation and application of essential oil nano-emulsions as antifungal delivery system in citrus postharvest disease management."

A total of 653 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between control (48 hpi) and nano-emulsion treatment (48 hpi) of fruit transcriptome, including 444 up-regulated and 209 downregulated genes. Genes encoding caffeoyl-shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase / acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (COMT), cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD) were differentially expressed by nano-emulsion treatment. In addition, 175 differential accumulated metabolites between the control and the nano-emulsion-treated fruit at 48 hpi also were identified, the different accumulated metabolites from phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway related with disease resistance including L -phenylalanine, caffeic acid, caffeoyl quinic acid, coniferyl alcohol, coniferaldehyde. The integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were mainly involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. Besides, the nano-emulsion significantly induced accumulation of important amino acids, soluble sugars, organic acids, lipids, sugar and alcohols. The results also indicated that the antioxidant enzyme activity, PR related enzyme and secondary metabolites biosynthesis related enzyme activity were increased by nano-emulsion treatment, including peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), β-1,3-glucanase (GLU), chitinase (CHI), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumaric acid: coenzyme A ligase (4CL) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). The flavonoids, total phenolic, and lignin contents were higher and fruit firmness was enhanced in nano-emulsion treated fruit. The MDA and H 2 O 2 content were lower in the nano-emulsion treated fruit. All these results indicated that essential oil nano-emulsion as an antifungal delivery system to induce resistance against P. digitatum infection of ‘Newhall’ navel orange. Next, we aim to further verify the function of differential expressed genes and activation function of transcription factors on downstream genes. Considering the natural nontoxic attributes of cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol and eugenol, application of essential oil nano-emulsion could overcome essential oil’s drawback and confer resistance against pathogen infection of fruit. Whereas, further research will be required to study the nano-emulsion impacts on texture, flavor properties of fruit in field application. We believe that our results will give theoretical foundation for the exploitation and application of plant extract essential oil encapsulated in nano-emulsion as a biological fungicide."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Citrus fruits are vulnerable to pathogen infection after harvest, one alternative strategy to control postharvest pathogen proposed by many researchers is that the application of some exogenous elicitors could induce resistance which play a role to against pathogen infection ( Walters et al., 2013 ). Excessive quantity resistance inducer would not be proposed due to consumer concern regarding organoleptic quality, environment safety and human health concern. Furthermore, some inducer materials tend to be decomposed before to function in crops. Nano-emulsion based encapsulation system can overcome essential oil’s hydrophobicity, volatility and improve bioavailability ( Khot et al., 2012 ). They have been extensively applied in postharvest preservation and pathogen control. Although previous research revealed the induced resistance by the elicitor application response in citrus fruit ( Wu et al., 2017 ), the integrated transcriptome with metabolome associated with induced resistance research is still in its infancy. Fruit can initiate endogenous defence mechansim through primary and secondary metabolites changes against pathogen infection. Plant metabolites is closely associated with phenotype, profiling regarding metabolites variation of induced resistance can give us intuitively illustrations than transcriptomics. By transcriptomics together with metabolomics technology, the significantly enriched genes, metabolites and pathway involved in fruit defense can be identified. Combined transcriptomics with metabolomics regarding induced resistance of fruit interaction with pathogen is still more researcher’s interests. The strategy of combining transcriptomics and metabolomic can help us understand the relationship between the changes of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in citrus fruits and the subsequent changes in metabolites under the action of exogenous inducers, and illustrate its disease resistance mechanism. In the previous work, the authors found that cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol have strong antifungal activity against P. digitatum ( Wan et al., 2017, 2019 ). In this work, a combination of essential oil cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol and eugenol were encapsulated in a stable nano-emulsion. The author hypothesized that use of this stable nano-emulsion would confer resistance to ‘Newhall’ navel orange against P. digitatum infection. The findings from this study will provide important inferences for the exploitation and application of essential oil nano-emulsions as antifungal delivery system in citrus postharvest disease management. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Fruit materials ‘Newhall’ navel orange ( Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) was harvested in the commercial ripening state from a local orchard on 11 November, 2020 in Ganzhou city, Jiangxi Province, China. The fruit was kept away from disease infection or mechanical injuries during pickering and handling, and that transport to our laboratory, field heat was ventilated for two days at room temperature before use. 2.2 Fungal pathogen The fungal pathogen was isolated from P. digitatum infected navel orange preserved it at 4 ℃ in the plant pathology laboratory of Jiangxi Agricultural University. P. digitatum hyphae were picked by an inoculation loop and transferred on the sterilized PDA medium, placed it in a 28 ℃ incubator for one week, washed the P. digitatum into the flask with sterile water, and dispersed the spores with glass beads. After filtration, a spore suspension was obtained, which was counted with a haemocytometer to make the spore concentration to 1 × 10 6 spores mL −1 . 2.3 Preparation of nano-emulsion The preparation of nano-emulsion was based on our previous study ( Yang et al., 2021 ). Essential oil cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol and eugenol were mixed in a ratio of 1:1:1, then dissolved in 2% Tween-80, a high-shear mixer (ULTRA TURRAX® T18 digital, IKA, Staufen, Germany) was used to blend the mixture. The mixed solution passed through a microfluidizer (M-110 P, Microfluidics Corporation, United States), finally, a stock solution of 100 mg/mL was obtained. 2.4 The inhibitory effect of nano-emulsion on P. digitatum growth in vivo The fruit selection criteria based on the uniform in color, ripeness, size, shape and weight. The fruits were disinfected with 2 % NaClO solution for 2–3 min, then washed the fruits with sterile water, and placed on a clean workbench under UV lamp for sterilization and dry at 25 °C. Using a sterilized pipette to puncture a wound at the equator of the fruit (diameter: 3 mm, depth: 4 mm). Each wound was inoculated with 15 μL spore suspension by a pipette. After 24 h, add 15 μL of sterile water and different concentrations (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/mL) of nano-emulsion with a pipette, then put the fruits in a plastic box and place them in an incubator at 25 ± 2 °C with 80–90 % RH for 6 days. The lesion diameter was measured according to ( Zhou et al., 2018 ) method. Inhibitory rate = (C–T) / C × 100 %, where C, T are the lesion diameter of control and nano-emulsion treatment respectively. Taking the inhibitory rate as ( y ) and the logarithmic results of the nano-emulsion concentration as ( x ), the correlation coefficient R 2 , EC 50 and the regression equation y = a + b ln ( x ) for the inhibitory effect of nano-emulsion on lesion growth was established.

Each treatment has three replicates which 15 fruits for each replicate, the experiment was conducted two times. 2.5 Effects of nano-emulsion on induced disease resistance The experiment was conducted refer to ( Ballester et al., 2013 ) method with minor modification. Using a sterilized pipette to puncture a wound at the equator of the fruit (diameter: 3 mm, depth: 4 mm), Each wound was inoculated with 15 μL spore suspension by a pipette. After 24 h, add 15 μL nano-emulsion (the concentration was EC 50 ), control sample was added 15 μL sterilized water. After air drying, place the fruits in a plastic box and then in an incubator at 25 ± 2 °C with 80–90 % RH for 5 days. Flavedo were taken 1 cm away from entire wounds of 30 fruits with a sterile scalpel at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h for control and nano-emulsion samples. Citrus peels were immediately frozen and kept it at − 80 °C refrigerator. Each treatment has three replicates which 15 fruits for each replicate, the experiment was conducted two times. 2.6 Determination of firmness Fruit firmness was analysed by a TA. XT plusC Texture Analyser (Stable Micro System Ltd), the results expressed as N. 2.7 Determination of total phenolics, flavonoids content Phenols’ extraction was conducted refer to ( Ramful et al., 2011 ) method. Folin–Ciocalteu method was used to determine the total phenol content ( Goulas and Manganaris, 2012 ). The flavonoid contents were determined refer to ( Wang et al., 2008 ) method. 2.8 Determination of lignin content The lignin content was determined refer to ( Deng et al., 2015 ) method with minor modification. 2.9 Determination of H 2 O 2 and MDA content The H 2 O 2 content was determined refer to ( Yang et al., 2020 ) method by following the instructions of “H 2 O 2 detection Kit” (NJBI, Nanjing, China).

RNA isolation was conducted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, United States). RNA integrity was evaluated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyser 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). RNA purity was checked by the NanoPhotometer ® spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA). RNA concentration was checked by Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The library preparations and transcriptome sequencing were implemented on Illumina Hiseq platform in Shanghai applied protein technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All treatments were conducted by doing three biological replicates. The raw reads which have adapter or ploy-N and low-quality were discarded. Clean reads which mapped to the reference genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000695605.1). FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) value represents gene expression level. The differential expression genes were identified by DESeq2. The adjusted P -value < 0.05 to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The significantly differentially expressed genes were identified when |log 2 FC= ≥1 and FDR < 0.05. For function and pathway enrichment of DEGs, GO and KEGG enrichment were conducted, a P -value < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. All raw reads from RNA-seq had been loaded at the NCBI (national center for biotechnology information) sequence read archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) under the accession number PRJNA792557. 2.14 Metabolome analysis 2.14.1 Sample preparation and extraction For metabolome analysis, citrus fruits were divided into seven groups: ‘0 h′ (0 hpi of P. digitatum without nano-emulsion), ‘CK24h’ (24 hpi of P. digitatum without nano-emulsion), ‘CK48h’ (48 hpi of P. digitatum without nano-emulsion), ‘CK72h’ (72 hpi of P. digitatum without nano-emulsion). ‘NR24h’ (24 hpi of P. digitatum with nano-emulsion, treatment). ‘NR48h’ (48 hpi of P. digitatum with nano-emulsion, treatment), ‘NR72h’ (72 hpi of P. digitatum with nano-emulsion, treatment). First, vacuum freeze-dryer (Scientz-100 F) was used to freeze-dried all samples, then a mixer mill (MM 400, Retsch) was used to crush the samples at 30 Hz for 1.5 min. Second, a total 100 mg powder of all samples were dissolved in 1.2 mL 70% methanol solution. Third, vortexed the sample 30 s every 30 mins interval by 6 times. Finally, placed it in a refrigerator at 4 °C for 24 h. The mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min after extraction and the supernatants were filtered (SCAA-104, 0.22 µm pore size; ANPEL, Shanghai, China) before UPLC-MS/MS analysis. A quality control sample was prepared by mixing the identical amounts from all samples. 2.14.2 UPLC conditions The peel extracts were analysed by an UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system (UPLC, SHIMADZU NexeraX2; MS, Applied Biosystems 4500 Q TRAP) with a C18 column (Agilent SB-C18, 1.8 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm). The solvent system was ultra-pure water containing 0.1% formic acid as mobile phase A and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as mobile phase B. The A:B (v:v) gradient program was as follows: 95:5(v:v) at 0 min, 5:95(v:v) at 9.0 min, 5:95 (v:v) at 10.0 min, 95:5 (v:v) at 10–11.1 min, and 95:5 (v:v) at 14.0 min. The flow velocity was adjusted to 0.35 mL/min. The column oven temperature was set to 40 °C. The injection volume was 4 μL. The effluent was connected to an ESI-triple quadrupole-linear ion trap (Q TRAP)-MS. 2.14.3 ESI-Q TRAP-MS/MS A triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Q TRAP, AB4500 Q TRAP UPLC/MS/MS System) equipped with an ESI Turbo Ion-Spray interface was used to get linear ion trap (LIT) and triple quadrupole (QQQ) scans. The operating in positive and negative ion mode and controlled by analyst 1.6.3 software (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). The ESI source temperature was 550 °C; ion spray voltage (IS) was 5500 V (positive ion mode)/− 4500 V (negative ion mode). Ion source gas I (GSI), 50.0 psi; gas II(GSII), 60.0 psi; curtain gas (CUR), 25.0 psi. The collision-activated dissociation (CAD) was high. Instrument tuning and mass calibration were conducted with 10 and 100 μmol/L polypropylene glycol solution in QQQ and LIT modes, respectively. The QQQ scan was obtained as an MRM experiment with the collision gas (nitrogen) set to medium. DP and CE for individual MRM transitions was done by further DP and CE optimization. A specific set of MRM transitions were monitored during each period based on the metabolites eluted during this period. Metabolites were identified using the metware database (MWDB) (Wuhan Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) and other public databases. 2.14.4 Differential metabolites selected R (base package) 3.5.1 and R (MetaboAnalystR) 1.0.1 software was used to perform principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant (OPLS-DA) analysis respectively which evaluate the metabolite differences between and within group samples. Differential accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were identified based on a variable importance in the project (VIP) ≥ 1 and One-way ANOVA ( P < 0.05). Using the KEGG database to analyse the metabolic pathways and screen the key metabolites contributed to fruit pathogen resistance. 2.15 Integration analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic Pearson correlations between DEGs and DAMs was calculated for the combined analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic. Pairwise relations with p -value < 0.05 and |PCC| > 0.8 were used to construct the network. 2.16 Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis In order to verify the accuracy and reliability of RNA-seq data, 10 DEGs were randomly selected to conduct qRT-PCR analysis. The citrus actin gene (AF052608) was used as an internal reference and Primer-Blast of NCBI (National Centre of Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD, United States) was used to design target gene primer pairs ( Table S2 ). The Hifair® Ⅲ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix for qPCR (gDNA digester plus) (YEASEN Biotech Co, Ltd. Shanghai, China) was used to synthesis First-strand cDNA. The qRT-PCR experiment was conducted on the CFX96 touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, USA) with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara, Dalian, China). PCR procedure was at 95 ℃ for 3 min of one cycle, 95 ℃ for 5 s of 39 cycles, 60 ℃ for 3 min. Gene Relative expression were calculated using the 2 −△△ CT method ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ). The qPCR expression levels were calculated as a ratio relative to the level of expression in the control group, which was set as 1. Each treatment has three biological replicates and three measurements were conducted for each replicate. 2.17 Statistical Analysis Excel 2013 was used for data processing. Significance analysis was performed using Duncan’s multiple comparison test and T -test of SPSS 20.0. Graphpad 8.0 was used for mapping.

At 48 hpi, the activity of the nano-emulsion treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group ( P < 0.05). The β-1,3-glucanase activity of the control and the nano-emulsion treatment group decreased gradually after reaching a peak at 48 hpi, but the enzyme activity of the nano-emulsion treatment group was extremely significantly higher than that of the control group in the later post-inoculation time ( P < 0.01). It can be seen from Fig. 2 F that the activity of chitinase showed a tendency that increased sharply and then decreased in the control and nano-emulsion treatment group. The activity of chitinase reached a peak at 72 hpi in the control and the nano-emulsion treatment group.

Compared with the control, the SOD activity showed an obvious upward trend before 48 hpi in the nano-emulsion treatment group, which reached the peak at 48 hpi, and its activity was extremely significantly higher than that of the control group ( P < 0.01). After 48 hpi, the activity decreased gradually and then slowly increased. Enzyme activity of the nano-emulsion treatment was extremely significantly higher than that of the control group during the entire inoculation time ( P < 0.01). From Fig. 3 C, the catalase (CAT) activity increased sharply and reached the peak at 72 hpi, after that decreased slowly in the control and the nano-emulsion treatment group. The CAT activity decreased gradually in the control and the nano-emulsion treatment group after 72 hpi, whereas the activity of the control was extremely significantly lower than that of the nano-emulsion treatment group ( P < 0.01). As shown in Fig. 3 D, the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity showed different trends in the control and the nano-emulsion treatment group. The activity of APX decreased slowly before 48 hpi, and then decreased sharply after 48 hpi in the control group. The activity of APX increased firstly, reached its peak at 24 hpi and then gradually decreased in the nano-emulsion treatment group, whereas the enzyme activity was significantly higher than that of the control group at 72 hpi ( P < 0.05). 3.8 Effect of nano-emulsion treatment on phenylpropane biosynthesis pathway enzyme activity of citrus peel It can be seen from Fig. 3 E that after inoculation of P. digitatum , the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) showed different variations in the control and the nano-emulsion treatment group. The activity of PAL increased slowly in the control group, which reached the peak at 96 hpi and then decreased slowly. The activity of PAL in the nano-emulsion treatment group increased significantly, which reached the peak at 96 hpi and dropped sharply, whereas its activity was extremely significantly higher than that of the control group ( P < 0.01). It can be seen from Fig. 3 F that the 4-coumaric acid: Coenzyme A ligase (4CL) activity of the control and nano-emulsion treatment group increased with inoculation time extension, reached the peak thereafter decreased sharply. The 4CL activity of the control group and the nano-emulsion treatment group reached the maximum at 72 hpi. At 120 hpi, the activity of the control was significantly lower than that of the nano-emulsion treatment group ( P < 0.05). As shown in Fig. 3 G, the activity of cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase (C4H) showed that the nano-emulsion treatment was higher than that of the control group, In the early stage of post-inoculation, the enzyme activity difference was not significant between the control and the treatment group ( P > 0.05). After 48 hpi, the enzyme activity of the control group and the treatment group increased rapidly, which both reached the peak at 96 hpi and then decreased, whereas the activity of the control was significantly lower than that of the nano-emulsion treatment group ( P < 0.05). It can be seen from Fig. 3 H that the activity of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) showed different variations in the control and the nano-emulsion treatment group. The activity of CAD in the control group increased significantly before 48 hpi, thereafter decreased and maintained a gradual variation. The activity of CAD in the nano-emulsion treatment group also showed a rapid increase before 48 hpi and reached the maximum at 48 hpi, after that decreased gradually, whereas the enzyme activity was significantly higher than that of the control group at 120 hpi ( P < 0.05). 3.9 RNA-seq 3.9.1 Correlation evaluation between samples Pearson's correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of gene expression levels between samples was used to evaluate the correlation of samples. As shown in Fig. 9 , the value R 2 of three biological replicates in CK0h, CK48h and NR48h was greater than 0.8. It indicated that the results of this experiment were reliable and the sample selection was reasonable. 3.9.2 Quality assessment of RNA-seq results Table S1 indicated that there were 9 samples which consist of three treatments in RNA-seq, and each treatment has triple biological replicates. Totally 60.57 Gb of clean data obtained, after low-quality reads checking, all samples GC content and Q20 value were above 44.00% and 97.00% respectively, indicating that obtained results were accurately and reliably for subsequent analysis. 3.9.3 differentially expressed genes between control and nano-emulsion To evaluate the induced resistance effect on transcriptomic reprogramming, we made the comparison between control (48 hpi) and the nano-emulsion treatment (48 hpi) samples. The volcano plots ( Fig. 4 A) revealed the difference of gene expression level and statistics significance degree of the DEGs, which were 653 genes were differentially expressed between control and nano-emulsion treatment, including 444 gene showed up-regulation tendency, whereas 209 gene was down-regulated. 3.9.4 GO analysis of DEGs As shown in Fig. 4 B, the differential expressed genes were mainly significantly enriched in the cellular component, which was mainly divided into two categories: photosystem I reaction center, photosystem I between control (48 hpi) and the nano-emulsion treatment (48 hpi) samples. 3.9.5 KEGGs analysis of DEGs Fig. 4 C revealed the top 20 enrichment pathway between control (48 hpi) and the nano-emulsion treatment (48 hpi) samples of KEGG analysis. Among these, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, acridone alkaloid biosynthesis, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, MAPK signalling pathway – plant involved in disease resistance. According to Fig. 4 C, phenylpropanoid biosynthetic was the most significantly enriched pathway by nano-emulsion treated compare with control. Furthermore, there were 28 DEGs enriched in this pathway, including three caffeoyl-shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase genes (HCT), two caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase genes (CCoAOMT); one caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase / acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase genes (COMT), one cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and eleven peroxidase gene (POD) were significantly upregulated in nano-emulsion elicited fruit. There were 55 DEGs enriched in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway, among these DEGs, the expression of GGPS (encoding geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase) was notably up-regulated 2.05-fold by nano-emulsion, which affected the biosynthesis of terpenoid backbone of citrus. In flavonoid biosynthesis, five DEGs involved in resistance against P. digitatum infection, including three genes encoding shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) and two genes encoding caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase genes (CCoAOMT) were up-regulated, the fold change increase from 1.024 to 2.546-fold compare with control. Except above mentioned pathways, the other KEGG pathways which are photosynthesis pathway; acridone alkaloid biosynthesis pathway; stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis pathway; pentose and glucuronate interconversions pathway; tryptophan metabolism; tyrosine metabolism pathway also involved in defence action. In photosynthesis pathway (13 DEGs), including five DEGs which encoded photosystem Ⅰ, three DEGs which encoded photosystem Ⅱ, five DEGs which encoded light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complex were also up-regulated. In acridone alkaloid biosynthesis pathway (2DEGs: LOC102626454, LOC102618836), which encoded acridone synthase and anthranilate N-methyltransferase participated in antimicrobial activities, increased 2.499 and 1.114-fold respectively. In stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis pathway, five DEGs were up-regulated from 1.024 to 2.546-fold.

Tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism pathway enriched seven and four DEGs respectively. 3.10 Metabolome analysis 3.10.1 Widely targeted metabolome of citrus peel Fig. 5 A indicated that the nano-emulsion induced resistance on metabolites variations of citrus peel between control (48 hpi) and the nano-emulsion treatment (48 hpi) samples. Totally, 503 metabolites were identified, among them, there were 175 significantly different metabolites between the control and the nano-emulsion treatment group. Of these, 77 metabolites were downregulated and 98 metabolites were upregulated. 3.10.2 Multivariate analysis PCA analysis was conducted for the 503 metabolites. Fig. 5 B indicated that PCA clearly separated the control (48 hpi) and the nano-emulsion treatment (48 hpi) samples. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis showed that two distinct groups between the control and the nano-emulsion treatment samples ( Fig. 5 C). Thus, according to PCA and cluster analysis which indicated that the control and the nano-emulsion treatments had different metabolite profiles. Accordingly, the PLS-DA model also was constructed ( Fig. 10 A), control and treated samples were remarkably separated. The model evaluation parameters (R 2 Y and Q 2 ) were obtained by 7-fold cross-validation, which were 0.999 and 0.981 respectively, indicating this PLS-DA model is stable and reliable ( Fig. 10 B). Additionally, in order to improve the analytical ability and validity of the model, the OPLS-DA model established to distinguish the variation between groups on t [1] and reflects the variation within groups on the orthogonal principal component to [1] ( Fig. 10 C). As shown in Fig. 10 D, the model evaluation parameters (R 2 Y and Q 2 ) were 1 and 0.946 respectively, indicating the model is stable and reliable. 3.10.3 KEGG enrichment analysis of differential accumulated metabolites KEGG enrichment analysis was conducted for the 175 significantly different accumulated metabolites between control (48 hpi) and the nano-emulsion treatment (48 hpi) samples. As shown in Fig. 5 D, the differential accumulated metabolites were significantly enriched in pathway of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, ABC transporters, biosynthesis of amino acids, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, 2-Oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, Purine metabolism, Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, Phenylalanine metabolism, Linoleic acid metabolism, Carbon metabolism, C5-Branched dibasic acid metabolism, Arginine biosynthesis, Tyrosine metabolism. 3.10.4 Changes of primary metabolites Table 2 revealed the primary metabolites variation from 24 h post-inoculation to 72 h post-inoculation between control and nano-emulsion treatment group. Amino acids including L -norleucine, L -methionine, L -phenylalanine, aspartic acid, glycine, L -tyrosine, lysine, L -tryptophan, L -glutamic acid, L -Valine were significantly accumulated compare with control. Organic acids including γ-aminobutyric acid, D -malic acid, α-ketoglutarate, and abscisic acid were significantly accumulated compare with control. Regarding free fatty acids, there were three free fatty acids were significantly upregulated in elicited versus control, including elaidic acid, octadecenoic acid, 9,16-Dihydroxypalmitic acid. Regarding soluble sugars and alcohols, the significantly accumulated sugars and alcohols include D -ribose, D -arabinose, and L- Xylose, D -galacturonic acid, D -glucuronic acid. 3.11 Integrated analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome Integrated transcriptome and the metabolome correlation analysis to show the correlation between different expression genes and different accumulated metabolites. The KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that 38 co-mapped pathways were mostly enriched ( Fig. 6 A). Among these co-mapped pathways, pentose and glucuronate interconversions; tryptophan metabolism; phenylpropanoid biosynthesis; flavonoid biosynthesis and stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis were the most significantly enriched pathways. The nine quadrants by Pearson correlation coefficients to determine the consistency between genes and metabolites. The genes and metabolites in the third and seventh quadrants illuminated that those genes are positively regulate metabolite changes ( Fig. 6 B). Heat map of DEGs and DAMs was constructed (Pearson correlation coefficient > 0.8), as shown in Fig. 11 , which showed the clustering characteristics between control and nano-emulsion treatment. According to the phenylpropanoid metabolism ( Fig. 7 ), we noted the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway between the control and nano-emulsion treated fruit. From the transcript aspects, genes encoding caffeoyl-shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase / acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (COMT), cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD) were up-regulated in nano-emulsion treatment fruit compared to control. From metabolomic level, the phenylalanine, which is a phenylpropanoid pathway precursor was significantly accumulated in the nano-emulsion treated fruit compared to the control ( Fig. 7 ). Furthermore, Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) more than 0.8 to construct the networks analysis for the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway which was closely related with synthesis antifungal metabolites. As can be seen from Fig. 6 C, the DAMs in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, such as caffeic acid, coniferyl alcohol, coniferaldehyde, caffeoylquinic acid, L -Phenylalanine were regulated by the DEGs, which encoding shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase / acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (COMT), cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD). The results indicated that the resistance of citrus against P. digitatum infection could be regulated by the co-expression of DEGs and DAMs related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. 3.12 Validation of RNA-Seq data by qRT-PCR Ten genes were randomly picked to investigate the reliability of the RNA-Seq results by qRT-PCR experiment. The results from qRT-PCR showed that except one gene (LOC102613838) was up-regulated which was not consistent with RNA-seq results, other nine DEGs showed same expression consistent with RNA-Seq results, which demonstrated that transcriptomic results were reliable. ( Fig. 8 ). 4 Discussion Transcriptomics and metabolomics were combined in our research to understand the mechanism of nano-emulsion as an exogenous elicitor confers resistance to citrus against P. digitatum infection. These results will give us more information from molecular level to understand the mechanism of transcriptome reprogramming, primary and secondary metabolism of citrus under biotic stress. In this research, eugenol, cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol were encapsulated in nano-emulsion system to deliver elicitor to confer resistance against P. digitatum infection of ‘Newhall’ navel orange. The results indicated that the DEGs and DAMs were significantly enriched in pentose and glucuronate interconversions; phenylpropanoid biosynthesis; tryptophan metabolism; flavonoid biosynthesis; stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, indicating that primary and secondary metabolites induced by nano-emulsion involved in enhanced disease resistance in citrus fruit. 4.1 Defense enzyme activity and antifungal metabolites contributed to disease resistance Previous researches have demonstrated that ROS level is closely associated with plant defense performance, excessive ROS might cause oxidative stress leading to membrane damage. Plants have enzymatic antioxidant and non-enzymatic antioxidant system can scavenge excess ROS. In enzymatic antioxidant system, SOD, CAT, and APX play decisive role as ROS scavenger ( Vuleta et al., 2016 ). The antioxidant enzymes activities can be activated by H 2 O 2 ( Joradol et al., 2019 ). Whereas, lipid peroxidation can be happened when excessive H 2 O 2 produced, the enzyme of CAT and POD as ROS scavenger can work synergistically to scavenge excess H 2 O 2 to prevent the cell from damage in plant. Our study revealed that the enhanced CAT, POD and SOD activity in inoculation citrus fruit by nano-emulsion elicitation compare with control. Similar research indicated that cinnamaldehyde can effectively confer resistance to citrus by increasing the defense-related enzyme activities and secondary metabolites ( Duan et al., 2021 ). Phenylpropanoid pathway can produce antifungal metabolites such as phenols and flavonoids and the enzyme PAL, 4CL, C4H and CAD are crucial enzyme in this pathway ( Yadav et al., 2020 ). Our results also observed that higher enzyme activities of PAL, C4H, CAD and 4CL along with total higher flavonoid, total phenolic and lignin contents in nano-emulsion treated fruit compare with control in whole inoculation period. In our study, the significantly accumulated phenolic acid from phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway including caffeic acid, coniferyl alcohol, coniferaldehyde caffeoylquinic acid after nano-emulsion treatment compare with control. Correspondingly, three gene encoding shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, two genes encoding caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, one gene encoding cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase, one gene encoding caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, eleven gene encoding peroxidase were upregulated, indicating that the enhanced resistance by nanoemlsion treatment. The lignin and flavonoid contents also increased by elicitor compare with control during whole inoculation period, gene expression results showed that there were five genes up-regulated from 1.024 to 2.546-fold in flavonoid biosynthesis; stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis pathway in our study. 4.2 Amino acids metabolism contributed to disease resistance Amino acids are the main components of protein biosynthesis. They participate in plant signal transduction and stress response. In addition, they also involved in multiple biosynthesis pathways ( Hildebrandt et al., 2015 ). In this study, the amino acids of L -norleucine, L -methionine, L -phenylalanine, aspartic acid, glycine, L -tyrosine, lysine, L -tryptophan, L -glutamic acid, L -Valine accumulated significantly after nano-emulsion treatment compare with control in inoculated fruit, indicating that those amino acids were accumulated by elicitor. Tryptophan metabolism pathway, glycine, serine and threonine pathway as a precursor for generating secondary metabolites leading to defense when plant under adverse conditions ( Tunsagool et al., 2019 ). According to KEGG enrichment of DEGs of RNA-seq data, in tryptophan metabolism pathway, one gene encoding acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase, one gene encoding indole-3-pyruvate monooxygenase were upregulated, five genes encoding acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase were downregulated compare with control. All these results indicated that DEGs take part in this pathway to regulate tryptophan metabolism which play important role in P. digitatum resistance. 4.3 Organic acids metabolism contributed to disease resistance Previous Research indicated that genes involved in plants growth and development, senescence, oxidative stress, cytosolic pH, ROS production signal transduction could be modulated by GABA to enhance stress tolerance ( Khan et al., 2021 ). In our research, the GABA accumulated significantly in nano-emulsion elicited fruit compare with control sample, indicating that GABA confer resistance to citrus fruit against P. digitatum infection. Organic acids are the intermediate products of TCA cycle and the carbon provider of metabolite biosynthesis ( Mhlongo et al., 2020 ). In our research, D -malic acid and α-ketoglutarate were significantly accumulated compare with control, indicating that the nano-emulsion affected the TCA cycle of inoculated fruit. 4.4 Sugars metabolism contributed to disease resistance Soluble sugar can provide energy and substances for plant defense response, and interact with hormone signal network in plant immune system to coordinate plant immune response ( Breia et al., 2021 ; Durán-Soria et al., 2020 ). In our study, there were three soluble sugars (DL-Xylose, D -Ribose, D -Arabinose) significantly accumulated by nano-emulsion treatment compare with control. The results indicated that the nano-emulsion as an elicitor can stimulate the accumulation of soluble sugars in inoculated citrus to enhance fruit defence capability. 4.5 Host pH modifications contributed to disease resistance P. digitatum is a necrotrophic fungus which can secrete pectinases to invade citrus peel that leading to fruit maceration ( Vilanova et al., 2018 ). There are four enzymes polygalacturonases (PGs), pectate and pectin lyases (PLs), rhamnogalacturonases and rhamnogalacturonase lyases to degrade the pectin backbone during infection process ( Ramoni and Seiboth, 2016 ). PGs can hydrolyse the polygalacturonic acid chain across the oxygen bridge ( Jayani et al., 2005 ), so the galacturonic acid accumulation in infection site could regarded as a biomarker of pectin degradation caused by PGs activity. In our study, the content of galacturonic acid of nano-emulsion treatment fruit was significantly lower compare with the control samples, and four gene encoding polygalacturonases, two gene encoding pectin lyases were down-regulated, indicating that nano-emulsion treatment disrupt the P. digitatum to secrete PG and PLs to degrade pectin of citrus fruit, thus enhance the citrus resistance to P. digitatum infection. 4.6 Immunity system contributed to disease resistance There are two surveillance systems in plant, pathogen-associated molecular patterns triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which to detect pathogen secreted molecules early, respond effectively and provide robust resistant pathogen infection ( Ngou et al., 2021 ). Pathogenic molecules were detected by plant cellular receptors PRRs, WAKs, and NLRs, respectively ( Andersen et al., 2018 ). These receptors promote plant recognize the pathogen early and successfully, prevent and delay the pathogen exceeding the infection site. Our results showing the genes (LOC102611904, LOC102624685, LOC102607213, LOC102617092) encoding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase; gene (LOC102611612; LOC102623834) encoding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase; gene (LOC107178380, LOC102607278, LOC102609131) encoding G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase; gene (LOC112497319, LOC102612879) encoding L -type lectin-domain containing receptor kinase VII were upregulated compare with control, which illuminated that nano-emulsion stimulate citrus fruits employ its cellular receptors for the early detection and resistance against of P. digitatum infection. 4.7 Phytohormones contributed to disease resistance Phytohormones as chemical messenger has important role to adjust plant growth, development and defence. Among different hormones in plant, jasmonic acid deemed as stress response hormones. ( Ghorbel and Brinib, 2021 ). Previous report demonstrated in Melampsora larici-populina –poplar interaction, jasmonic acid related genes expression was up-regulated to cope with the biotic stress ( Chen et al., 2021 ). In this research, RNA-seq results indicated that gene (LOC102616825) encoding jasmonate ZIM domain-containing protein and gene (LOC102607443) encoding transcription factor MYC2 up-regulated by 1.00 and 1.22-fold respectively. In addition, genes (LOC102607187) related to AUX/IAA also up-regulated 1.76-fold compare with control, indicating that these hormone signal transduction act synergistically and play important role in nano-emulsion stimulated defence resistance against P. digitatum infection. 4.8 Pathogenesis-related proteins contributed to disease resistance Chitinases is as typical pathogenesis-related proteins, which can hydrolyse and degrade chitin when fungi infect plant or fruit ( Van Loon et al., 2006 ). In previous plant–pathogen interactions, the results indicated that induced higher chitinases activity leading to fungal growth inhibition ( Lucas-Bautista et al., 2020 ). Most often, chitinases act as endochitinases or exochitinases. According to our RNA-seq results, which showed that gene (LOC102623680) encoding basic endochitinase, gene (LOC102628916) encoding chitinase-like protein1, gene (LOC102606732) encoding chitinase10, gene (LOC102628172) encoding endochitinase-like, gene (LOC102608623) encoding endochitinase EP3 were up-regulated compare with control. These results demonstrated that gene encoding chitinase was induced and highly expressed after exogenous stimulation. Corresponding with the changes in gene expression level, our results also showed that nano-emulsion stimulate the higher chitinases activity compare with control. Previous results also reported higher chitinases activity by elicitor ( Wang et al., 2021 ). 5 Conclusions This work comprehensively investigated a combination of cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol and eugenol were encapsulated in a stable nano-emulsion as an elicitor to induce disease resistance against P. digitatum in ‘Newhall’ navel orange through transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling. A total of 653 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between control (48 hpi) and nano-emulsion treatment (48 hpi) of fruit transcriptome, including 444 up-regulated and 209 downregulated genes. Genes encoding caffeoyl-shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase / acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (COMT), cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD) were differentially expressed by nano-emulsion treatment. In addition, 175 differential accumulated metabolites between the control and the nano-emulsion-treated fruit at 48 hpi also were identified, the different accumulated metabolites from phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway related with disease resistance including L -phenylalanine, caffeic acid, caffeoyl quinic acid, coniferyl alcohol, coniferaldehyde. The integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were mainly involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. Besides, the nano-emulsion significantly induced accumulation of important amino acids, soluble sugars, organic acids, lipids, sugar and alcohols. The results also indicated that the antioxidant enzyme activity, PR related enzyme and secondary metabolites biosynthesis related enzyme activity were increased by nano-emulsion treatment, including peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), β-1,3-glucanase (GLU), chitinase (CHI), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumaric acid: coenzyme A ligase (4CL) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). The flavonoids, total phenolic, and lignin contents were higher and fruit firmness was enhanced in nano-emulsion treated fruit. The MDA and H 2 O 2 content were lower in the nano-emulsion treated fruit. All these results indicated that essential oil nano-emulsion as an antifungal delivery system to induce resistance against P. digitatum infection of ‘Newhall’ navel orange. Next, we aim to further verify the function of differential expressed genes and activation function of transcription factors on downstream genes. Considering the natural nontoxic attributes of cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol and eugenol, application of essential oil nano-emulsion could overcome essential oil’s drawback and confer resistance against pathogen infection of fruit. Whereas, further research will be required to study the nano-emulsion impacts on texture, flavor properties of fruit in field application. We believe that our results will give theoretical foundation for the exploitation and application of plant extract essential oil encapsulated in nano-emulsion as a biological fungicide.
