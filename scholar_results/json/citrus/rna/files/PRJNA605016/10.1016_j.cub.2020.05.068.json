    "full_text": "Thorns arise from axillary shoot apical meristems that proliferate for a time and then terminally differentiate into a sharp tip. Like other meristems, thorn meristems contain stem cells but, in the case of thorns, these stem cells undergo a programmed cessation of proliferative activity. Using Citrus , we characterize a gene network necessary for thorn development. We identify two Citrus genes, THORN IDENTITY1 ( TI1 ) and THORN IDENTITY2 ( TI2 ), encoding TCP transcription factors, as necessary for stem cell quiescence and thorn identity. Disruption of TI1 and TI2 function results in reactivation of stem cells and concomitant conversion of thorns to branches. Expression of WUSCHEL ( WUS ) defines the shoot stem cell niche in the apical meristems of many angiosperm species; we show that TI1 binds to the Citrus WUS promoter and negatively regulates its expression to terminate stem cell proliferation. We propose that shifts in the timing and function of components of this gene network can account for the evolution of Citrus thorn identity. Modulating this pathway can significantly alter plant architecture and could be leveraged to improve crop yields."

          "Plants vary significantly in their architecture; this diversity is achieved to a large extent by differential activity of their stem-cell-containing meristems [ 1 ]. Whereas the primary shoot and root apical meristems are established during embryogenesis and give rise to the main plant axis, axillary, accessory, and lateral meristems contribute to postembryonic growth, including the formation of branches, cambium, and lateral roots [ 2 ]. Although in common parlance thorns refer to any sharp pointed plant structure, in botanical terms thorns are distinct from spines (modified leaves) and prickles (modified epidermal cells), and refer to axillary shoots ending in a sharp hard tip. Thorns are thought to have evolved as a defense against herbivory [ 3 ]. The distribution of thorn-bearing species across angiosperm phylogeny, including in the plant orders Magnoliales, Carophyllales, Malpighiales, Fabales, Gentianales, and Sapindales, suggests that thorns have evolved many times and may represent an example of convergent evolution.",
          "Thorns arise from axillary meristems that undergo a period of cell division, followed by terminal differentiation and sclerification to form the hardened sharp tip [ 2 ]. A transition from actively proliferating meristematic stem cells to terminal differentiation also occurs during Arabidopsis floral development, and relies on a series of floral-signal-induced feedback loops to negatively regulate stem cell activity [ 4 , 5 ]. In shoot meristems, the homeodomain-containing transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is expressed in a small domain of cells, the organizing center, and signals through intercellular transport to the overlying stem cells to maintain their proliferative capacity [ 6–8 ]. Floral induction results in the floral-specific activation of expression of the AGAMOUS (AG) MADS domain transcription factor, which in turn regulates a transcriptional cascade mediated by the KNUCKLES protein as well as by directly recruiting Polycomb group proteins to the WUS promoter to downregulate the expression of WUS and terminate stem cell proliferation [ 4 , 5 , 9 , 10 ]. AG also acts to modulate auxin homeostasis through at least two different pathways, both of which are thought to culminate in the downregulation of WUS , arrest of cell division, and cessation of meristematic activity [ 11–14 ]. However, it seems unlikely that these AG-dependent floral-specific mechanisms operate in the termination of stem cell proliferation during vegetative thorn development.",
          "To define the mechanisms regulating vegetative stem cell proliferation and arrest, we sought to develop Citrus (in the family Rutaceae) as a model system to study thorn development, with most Citrus species presenting thorns ( https://citrusvariety.ucr.edu/index.html ). Here we identify a Citrus gene, THORN IDENTITY1 ( TI1 ), an ortholog of the Arabidopsis TCP gene BRANCHED1 ( BRC1 ), as being necessary for thorn identity and the regulation of stem cell proliferation . We also show that a close paralog, THORN IDENTITY2 ( TI2 ), has a partially redundant role in specifying thorn identity. We further define a regulatory cascade that controls stem cell activity in developing Citrus thorn primordia in a manner that is distinct from what has been observed in floral primordia, and which sheds new light on the regulatory roles of this family of TCP transcription factors. Based on these observations, we suggest that a heterochronic shift in the action of these TCP transcription factors and changes in target binding sites are in part responsible for the evolution of thorn identity in Citrus ."

              "To characterize the molecular genetic mechanisms controlling thorn development, we utilized the Citrus hybrid Carrizo citrange ( Citrus sinensis “Washington’” sweet orange × Poncirus trifoliata ), a common commercial rootstock variety [ 15 ]. In Carrizo citrange, nearly all nodes contain a single unbranched thorn in their leaf axil during juvenile growth ( Figures S1 A and S1B). The thorns emerged in an acropetal manner with younger thorns growing in the axils of younger leaves at the apex; the thorns arose in a consistent phyllotaxy offset from the subtending leaf ( Figures 1 A and 1B ). Notably, unlike axillary meristems that remained dormant unless triggered by auxin depletion to produce a branch, thorn meristems grew in a continuous manner, from their inception until they terminally differentiated. The growth of the thorn primordium and dormancy of the branch primordium at the same node in a consistent phyllotactic pattern suggests that there is an offset competition between auxin signaling and strigolactone signaling [ 16 ], such that there is a bias in outgrowth at the node.",
              "We staged thorn primordia according to the node at which they emerged ( Figures 1 C–1M). Each node possessed a typical branch-producing axillary meristem and a thorn meristem. At early stages, the thorn primordia appeared dome shaped and the neighboring dormant axillary meristem was enclosed by a bract. As growth proceeded in the thorn primordium, epidermal cells became elongated and arranged in files, such that the apex of the thorn gradually changed from a dome-shaped to a more pointed structure ( Figures 2 A–2C).",
              "We examined the transcriptional expression of histone H4 , a marker of the S phase of the cell cycle [ 17 ], to characterize cell-proliferation patterns in developing thorns, whereas lignin deposition was used as a proxy for terminal differentiation ( Figures S1 C–S1H). Lignification was first apparent at stage 13, and progressed through subsequent stages in a basipetal fashion. Comparisons of lignification and histone H4 expression at stage 15 indicated that cells toward the tip of the thorn that were undergoing lignification had ceased cell proliferation, whereas cells at the base of the thorn primordium continued to divide."

            "paragraphs": [
              "To molecularly characterize thorn meristematic activity, we examined the RNA expression patterns of several shoot meristem markers in Carrizo citrange thorn primordia. These included orthologs of the class I KNOX gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS ( STM ) that, in Arabidopsis thaliana , is expressed throughout the shoot meristem and is required for the maintenance of the meristematic stem cell population [ 18 , 19 ] and WUS , that is expressed in the stem cell niche and promotes stem cell fate and whose function is widely conserved in angiosperms [ 6 , 20–22 ]. In situ hybridizations revealed a pattern of expression of CsSTM in thorn primordia consistent with meristematic activity ( Figures 2 D–2F and S2 ). Expression of CsSTM was observed in the stage 4 presumptive thorn primordium and persisted throughout the primordium until stage 7. By stage 8, however, CsSTM expression was confined to the vasculature in the basal regions similar to the vascular expression observed in the primary shoot stem in other species [ 23 , 24 ]. The axillary meristem located at the same node retained CsSTM expression at these later stages.",
              "CsWUS was expressed in the organizing center of both the shoot apical meristem and the axillary meristem ( Figure S2 ). In addition, CsWUS expression was seen in the center of developing thorn primordia through stage 7 ( Figures 2 G–2I and S2 ). At stage 8 and after, CsWUS expression was undetectable in thorn primordia but the axillary meristem still retained CsWUS expression at these later stages. This suggests that the thorn meristem undergoes temporal repression of CsWUS expression, similar to floral meristem termination in Arabidopsis [ 5 ].",
              "To test whether AG might be involved in the downregulation of CsWUS during thorn development, we examined CsAG expression in vegetative tissues. Although CsAG was robustly detected in flower and fruit primordia, it was not detectably expressed in vegetative tissues ( Figure S3 A), suggesting that CsWUS downregulation in thorn primordia depends on other factors."

              "To identify candidate genes involved in thorn development, we carried out comparative transcriptomics of shoot tips of two Citrus aurantiifolia (lime) cultivars: key lime and thornless key lime, a cultivar that lacks thorn outgrowth ( Figures 3 A and 3B ; Data S1 ). We found that 75 genes were upregulated and 363 genes were downregulated (≥2-fold, p < 0.05) in thornless key lime compared to key lime. We focused on transcription factors with preferential expression in developing thorns. Among them is TI1 , an ortholog of the Arabidopsis BRC1 gene, encoding a class II TCP-family transcription factor ( Figure S4 A). TCP transcription factors have been implicated in the regulation of lateral meristem growth and cell proliferation in a variety of contexts as well as in modulating hormone action [ 25 ], making TI1 an attractive candidate for controlling thorn development. BRC1 orthologs have been shown to participate in the regulation of axillary bud outgrowth and branching in a variety of species [ 25–31 ], but have not been previously implicated in thorn outgrowth. Quantitative real-time PCR validation of the transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the C. aurantiifolia TI1 gene was expressed more highly in key lime shoot tips as compared to those of thornless key lime ( Figure 3 D). Similarly, TI1 was also significantly less expressed in a thornless isolate of Citrus reticulata (mandarin “W. Murcott”) as compared to mandarin ( Figures 3 C and 3D).",
              "In Carrizo citrange, TI1 transcripts were preferentially expressed in the thorn tip ( Figures 3 E–3G, S3 B, and S3C). TI1 expression was first seen in stage 8 thorn primordia, and was maintained in the thorn primordium until later stages of thorn differentiation. Both temporally and spatially, the TI1 expression pattern was largely complementary to that of CsWUS in developing thorn primordia.",
              "Using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach optimized for Citrus [ 32 , 33 ], we targeted Carrizo citrange TI1 using three distinct guide RNAs (gRNAs) ( Figure 3 H). We recovered three independent plants for each gRNA which, by sequence analyses, were non-chimeric and contained biallelic or homozygous mutations at the TI1 locus ( Table S2 ). These ti1 mutant plants showed a transformation of thorns into branches, with over 10% of thorns showing such a transformation ( Figures 3 I–3M). Most thorn primordia in the ti1 mutant plants showed some degree of abnormal growth, suggesting a partial transformation ( Figure 3 M). In addition, the ti1 plants showed an increase in branching, reflecting outgrowth of axillary meristems in addition to the transformation of thorns into branches ( Figure 3 M).",
              "Downregulation of TI1 in Carrizo citrange using an RNAi approach confirmed the requirement of TI1 for thorn determinacy. An RNAi construct containing the TI1 coding sequence was transformed into Carrizo citrange and five resulting transgenic plants were recovered that showed a partial transformation of thorns into branches, consisting of a radially symmetric thorn-like outgrowth with an indeterminate tip that produced one or more leaves ( Figures 3 N–3R). In addition, these plants showed a modest increase in axillary branching ( Figure 3 R). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses of two of these RNAi plants indicated that TI1 expression was reduced to approximately 40% of controls ( Figure 3 S)."

              "Examination of the C. sinensis genome revealed the presence of two closely related class II TCP-family paralogs of TI1 , termed TI2 and TCP1 ( Figure S4 A). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that TI2 was expressed in a similar fashion to TI1 , with strong expression detectable in young thorn primordia ( Figure S3 C). In situ hybridizations showed that expression of TI2 was first detectable in stage 7 thorn primordia, and maintained in much of the primordium through stage 10 ( Figures 4 A–4D), suggesting TI2 may also have a role in specifying thorn identity. TI2 expression was also observed in the associated axillary meristem and in the surrounding bract ( Figures 4 A–4D).",
              "We generated TI2 CRISPR-induced mutants using two distinct gRNAs ( Figure 4 E), and recovered three independent homozygous or biallelic mutant plants for each gRNA ( Table S2 ). The ti2 mutants showed a low but detectable (~6%) frequency of thorns transformed into branches ( Figures 4 F–4J). In contrast to ti1 mutants, the ti2 mutants displayed considerable outgrowth of the axillary meristems into branches, as well as promoting the outgrowth of the bracts into unifoliate leaves ( Figures 4 I and 4J). To confirm that the phenotypes we observed for TI1 and TI2 were specific, we also carried out CRISPR-induced mutagenesis of TCP1 ( Figure S4 B). We did not observe any disruption of plant architecture in the three tcp1 mutants recovered ( Figures S4 C and S4D).",
              "We generated ti1 ti2 double mutants using a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 approach ( Figure 5 A). We recovered six independent double mutants, all of which showed a dramatic transformation of almost every thorn into a branch ( Figures 5 B–5I). These double mutants also displayed enhanced branch outgrowth from axillary meristems and outgrowth of the associated bracts into leaves, resulting in extremely bushy plants ( Figure 5 I). We also generated ti1 ti2 tcp1 triple mutants and those mutants showed the same phenotype as ti1 ti2 double mutants, supporting the idea that TCP1 does not play a redundant role in thorn development ( Figures S4 E–S4H). Together, these results demonstrate that TI1 and TI2 act partially redundantly in controlling thorn identity and shoot branching."

              "The morphological changes associated with the conversion of thorns into branches in the ti1 ti2 mutants began to be evident by stage 8, the stage at which CsWUS is normally downregulated in thorn primordia ( Figure 6 A). Furthermore, CsWUS expression was significantly enhanced in ti1 , ti2 , and ti1 ti2 mutants, indicating that TI1 and TI2 act as negative regulators of CsWUS transcription ( Figure 6 B). We confirmed this downregulation using a dual-luciferase assay in Citrus protoplasts, in which CsWUS promoter activity was significantly reduced when either TI1 or TI2 was overexpressed ( Figures 6 C and 6D).",
              "We surveyed 3.2 kb upstream of the start of translation of the CsWUS gene and defined two potential TI binding sites ( Figure 6 E, P1 and P2), each containing a GGCCC core consensus binding sequence for class II TCP transcription factors [ 34–36 ]. Mutation of the P1 but not the P2 element disrupted the regulation of the CsWUS promoter by TI1 in dual-luciferase assays ( Figures 6 E and 6F). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses using Citrus protoplasts transfected with a 35S:TI1-eGFP construct showed strong enrichment for the binding of TI1 to both P1 (15-fold) and P2 (8-fold) regions of the CsWUS promoter but not to the CsWUS 3′ region, which lacks a TCP consensus binding site ( Figure 6 G). ChIP assays using young Carrizo citrange shoots and a polyclonal anti-TI1 antibody confirmed the binding of TI1 protein to both P1 and P2 regions of the CsWUS promoter ( Figure S5 ). We confirmed the sequence-specific binding of the TI1 protein to the P1 and P2 promoter elements by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays in which TI1 binding was competed out using a 20-fold excess of wild-type (WT) but not mutant P1 oligonucleotides; TI1 binding was only weakly abrogated in the presence of a mutant P2 competitor oligonucleotide ( Figure 6 H). Together, these results indicate that TI1 binding to the P1 site of the CsWUS promoter is critical for its downregulation.",
              "To demonstrate a functional requirement for the temporal downregulation of CsWUS in promoting thorn determinacy, we transiently overexpressed CsWUS in Carrizo citrange plants containing a 35S:CsWUS-GR construct. Four out of 12 plants showed fasciated stems after dexamethasone (DEX) induction of CsWUS protein activity. In these fasciated stems, thorn outgrowth was blocked and there was little expansion of leaf primordia ( Figures 6 I, 6J, and S6 ), suggesting that overproliferation of stem cells disrupted shoot and thorn development. A similar DEX-inducible phenotype was observed in 3 out of 6 transgenic Carrizo citrange plants containing a CsWUS-GR construct under the control of a 4.1-kb TI1 promoter region ( Figures 6 K, 6L, and S6 ). We regenerated Carrizo citrange plants containing a proTI1:CsWUS construct, and observed four lines that had fasciated stems and reduced leaf outgrowth, which failed to root ( Figure S6 ). Nevertheless, we successfully recovered seven lines with less severe phenotypes; in four of these lines approximately 30% of the thorn meristems were converted into axillary meristems ( Figure S6 ). We also observed thorn outgrowth defects similar to those of the ti1 mutant (~20%) in these plants. Furthermore, we observed the thorn transformed into the branch phenotype in transgenic Carrizo citrange plants containing the proWUS ( mP1 ) :WUS construct but not in those plants containing the proWUS:WUS construct, suggesting that termination of CsWUS expression by TI1 is critical for thorn identity ( Figure S7 )."

          "We have established the thorn as a new model system in which to study vegetative meristem determinacy. Whereas reproductive meristem determinacy, and concomitant stem cell arrest, has been well studied [ 37 , 38 ], analyses of vegetative determinacy have been quite limited. We have characterized thorn development in Carrizo citrange, and have shown that TI1 and TI2 , encoding two CYC/BRC1 class TCP transcription factors, are thorn identity genes.",
          "Stage-dependent downregulation of CsWUS expression by TI1 and TI2 is critical for thorn development ( Figure 7 ). We have observed that CsWUS expression is downregulated by stage 8 of thorn development; TI1 expression is first observed at this stage. If TI1 is mutated, CsWUS activity is retained in the thorn primordium, as in the axillary meristem, and so continued growth ensues. As such, the TI-CsWUS pathway in Citrus thorns is similar to the AG-WUS pathway in Arabidopsis floral development [ 9 , 39 ] in terms of terminating WUS transcriptional expression as a component of the determinacy pathway. Furthermore, we found that TI1 binds directly to the P1 site of the CsWUS promoter. The P1 binding site is not present in the A. thaliana WUS promoter, suggesting that thorn development was predicated in part upon the evolution of the P1 site within the Malvidae. It remains to be determined whether thorn development in other angiosperm clades depends on a similar direct transcriptional repression mechanism at the WUS promoter.",
          "Our work has also revealed the surprisingly distinct developmental trajectories of the adjacent thorn meristem and axillary meristem. Citrus thorns arise in a phyllotaxy that is offset to the subtending leaf axil, which likely reflects the interplay of auxin, cytokinin, and strigolactone action at the node [ 16 , 40 , 41 ]. This interplay presumably results in the differing expression patterns of the TI genes in the axillary meristem as opposed to the thorn meristem. In effect, thorn development would be the result of a heterochronic shift in TI expression; why this shift occurs only in Citrus thorn meristems and not the neighboring axillary meristems is as yet unknown.",
          "In response to TI1 and TI2 expression, there must be additional factors at play that distinguish between the axillary meristem and thorn meristem. Citrus thorn primordia grow continuously from their inception for a period of time, whereas the axillary meristems generally remain dormant. Thorn primordia are unresponsive to decapitation, whereas decapitation and the concomitant release from apical dominance promote axillary bud outgrowth. During axillary bud dormancy, BRC1 homologs have been shown to regulate auxin and ABA signaling [ 42–44 ]. We suggest that the differential expression of TI genes in the axillary meristem versus the thorn meristem may affect hormone signaling in each meristem in a distinct manner, resulting in differential growth patterns.",
          "The CYC / BRC1 clade genes have a conserved role in suppressing axillary bud outgrowth in both monocots and eudicots [ 45 ]. Surprisingly, CYC / BRC1 clade genes in the Cucurbitaceae ( TEN in Cucumis sativus and CmTCP1 in Cucumis melo ) have a critical role in shoot-derived tendril development [ 46–48 ]. Like mutations in TI1 and TI2 in Citrus that transform thorns into branches, mutations in Cucumis TEN or CmTCP1 result in conversion of tendrils to branches. These studies together suggest that during evolution, plants repurpose the use of CYC / BRC1 clade genes for the control of specific aspects of axillary growth in addition to a default role in branching inhibition. It remains to be determined whether a TCP - WUS regulatory module also operates to control tendril identity in Cucurbitaceae.",
          "Our findings shed light on the mechanisms controlling stem cell maintenance and proliferative growth during determinate development. Genetic alterations of plant architecture can increase crop yields, and the tuning of the TI - WUS pathway could be used to rationally design specific agronomic improvements not only in Citrus but potentially in many crop species."

Murcott mandarin was identified as a sport from around 40 seedlings. Cuttings from Citrus aurantiifolia key lime (hereafter referred to as TK), and Citrus aurantiifolia thornless key lime (hereafter referred to as TLK) were kept in an environmentally controlled growth chamber (24°C, 16 h light/8 h dark) at Yale. Plants over one year old were moved to a greenhouse at Marsh Botanical Garden at Yale. For observation of thorn production in Carrizo citrange, seeds were soaked in water overnight and germinated in turface clay, at 24°C under a 16 h day/8 h night regime and grown under these conditions. Emergence of the seedlings occurred within 2 weeks and the plants were then watered three times a week with water and supplemented twice a month with fertilizer (20:10:20) and chelated iron. For decapitation experiments, 20-week old plants with 18 to 25 nodes were decapitated between nodes number 18-20 and growth of the branches was scored 3 weeks later.",

    "full_text": "Introduction Plants vary significantly in their architecture; this diversity is achieved to a large extent by differential activity of their stem-cell-containing meristems [ 1 ]. Whereas the primary shoot and root apical meristems are established during embryogenesis and give rise to the main plant axis, axillary, accessory, and lateral meristems contribute to postembryonic growth, including the formation of branches, cambium, and lateral roots [ 2 ]. Although in common parlance thorns refer to any sharp pointed plant structure, in botanical terms thorns are distinct from spines (modified leaves) and prickles (modified epidermal cells), and refer to axillary shoots ending in a sharp hard tip. Thorns are thought to have evolved as a defense against herbivory [ 3 ]. The distribution of thorn-bearing species across angiosperm phylogeny, including in the plant orders Magnoliales, Carophyllales, Malpighiales, Fabales, Gentianales, and Sapindales, suggests that thorns have evolved many times and may represent an example of convergent evolution. Thorns arise from axillary meristems that undergo a period of cell division, followed by terminal differentiation and sclerification to form the hardened sharp tip [ 2 ]. A transition from actively proliferating meristematic stem cells to terminal differentiation also occurs during Arabidopsis floral development, and relies on a series of floral-signal-induced feedback loops to negatively regulate stem cell activity [ 4 , 5 ]. In shoot meristems, the homeodomain-containing transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is expressed in a small domain of cells, the organizing center, and signals through intercellular transport to the overlying stem cells to maintain their proliferative capacity [ 6–8 ]. Floral induction results in the floral-specific activation of expression of the AGAMOUS (AG) MADS domain transcription factor, which in turn regulates a transcriptional cascade mediated by the KNUCKLES protein as well as by directly recruiting Polycomb group proteins to the WUS promoter to downregulate the expression of WUS and terminate stem cell proliferation [ 4 , 5 , 9 , 10 ]. AG also acts to modulate auxin homeostasis through at least two different pathways, both of which are thought to culminate in the downregulation of WUS , arrest of cell division, and cessation of meristematic activity [ 11–14 ]. However, it seems unlikely that these AG-dependent floral-specific mechanisms operate in the termination of stem cell proliferation during vegetative thorn development. To define the mechanisms regulating vegetative stem cell proliferation and arrest, we sought to develop Citrus (in the family Rutaceae) as a model system to study thorn development, with most Citrus species presenting thorns ( https://citrusvariety.ucr.edu/index.html ). Here we identify a Citrus gene, THORN IDENTITY1 ( TI1 ), an ortholog of the Arabidopsis TCP gene BRANCHED1 ( BRC1 ), as being necessary for thorn identity and the regulation of stem cell proliferation . We also show that a close paralog, THORN IDENTITY2 ( TI2 ), has a partially redundant role in specifying thorn identity. We further define a regulatory cascade that controls stem cell activity in developing Citrus thorn primordia in a manner that is distinct from what has been observed in floral primordia, and which sheds new light on the regulatory roles of this family of TCP transcription factors. Based on these observations, we suggest that a heterochronic shift in the action of these TCP transcription factors and changes in target binding sites are in part responsible for the evolution of thorn identity in Citrus . Results Thorns Develop in a Tip-to-Base Fashion To characterize the molecular genetic mechanisms controlling thorn development, we utilized the Citrus hybrid Carrizo citrange ( Citrus sinensis “Washington’” sweet orange × Poncirus trifoliata ), a common commercial rootstock variety [ 15 ]. In Carrizo citrange, nearly all nodes contain a single unbranched thorn in their leaf axil during juvenile growth ( Figures S1 A and S1B). The thorns emerged in an acropetal manner with younger thorns growing in the axils of younger leaves at the apex; the thorns arose in a consistent phyllotaxy offset from the subtending leaf ( Figures 1 A and 1B ). Notably, unlike axillary meristems that remained dormant unless triggered by auxin depletion to produce a branch, thorn meristems grew in a continuous manner, from their inception until they terminally differentiated. The growth of the thorn primordium and dormancy of the branch primordium at the same node in a consistent phyllotactic pattern suggests that there is an offset competition between auxin signaling and strigolactone signaling [ 16 ], such that there is a bias in outgrowth at the node. We staged thorn primordia according to the node at which they emerged ( Figures 1 C–1M). Each node possessed a typical branch-producing axillary meristem and a thorn meristem. At early stages, the thorn primordia appeared dome shaped and the neighboring dormant axillary meristem was enclosed by a bract. As growth proceeded in the thorn primordium, epidermal cells became elongated and arranged in files, such that the apex of the thorn gradually changed from a dome-shaped to a more pointed structure ( Figures 2 A–2C). We examined the transcriptional expression of histone H4 , a marker of the S phase of the cell cycle [ 17 ], to characterize cell-proliferation patterns in developing thorns, whereas lignin deposition was used as a proxy for terminal differentiation ( Figures S1 C–S1H). Lignification was first apparent at stage 13, and progressed through subsequent stages in a basipetal fashion. Comparisons of lignification and histone H4 expression at stage 15 indicated that cells toward the tip of the thorn that were undergoing lignification had ceased cell proliferation, whereas cells at the base of the thorn primordium continued to divide. Thorn Primordia Express Meristematic Markers To molecularly characterize thorn meristematic activity, we examined the RNA expression patterns of several shoot meristem markers in Carrizo citrange thorn primordia. These included orthologs of the class I KNOX gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS ( STM ) that, in Arabidopsis thaliana , is expressed throughout the shoot meristem and is required for the maintenance of the meristematic stem cell population [ 18 , 19 ] and WUS , that is expressed in the stem cell niche and promotes stem cell fate and whose function is widely conserved in angiosperms [ 6 , 20–22 ]. In situ hybridizations revealed a pattern of expression of CsSTM in thorn primordia consistent with meristematic activity ( Figures 2 D–2F and S2 ). Expression of CsSTM was observed in the stage 4 presumptive thorn primordium and persisted throughout the primordium until stage 7. By stage 8, however, CsSTM expression was confined to the vasculature in the basal regions similar to the vascular expression observed in the primary shoot stem in other species [ 23 , 24 ]. The axillary meristem located at the same node retained CsSTM expression at these later stages. CsWUS was expressed in the organizing center of both the shoot apical meristem and the axillary meristem ( Figure S2 ). In addition, CsWUS expression was seen in the center of developing thorn primordia through stage 7 ( Figures 2 G–2I and S2 ). At stage 8 and after, CsWUS expression was undetectable in thorn primordia but the axillary meristem still retained CsWUS expression at these later stages. This suggests that the thorn meristem undergoes temporal repression of CsWUS expression, similar to floral meristem termination in Arabidopsis [ 5 ]. To test whether AG might be involved in the downregulation of CsWUS during thorn development, we examined CsAG expression in vegetative tissues. Although CsAG was robustly detected in flower and fruit primordia, it was not detectably expressed in vegetative tissues ( Figure S3 A), suggesting that CsWUS downregulation in thorn primordia depends on other factors. TI1 Is Expressed in Thorn Primordia and Is Required for Thorn Identity To identify candidate genes involved in thorn development, we carried out comparative transcriptomics of shoot tips of two Citrus aurantiifolia (lime) cultivars: key lime and thornless key lime, a cultivar that lacks thorn outgrowth ( Figures 3 A and 3B ; Data S1 ). We found that 75 genes were upregulated and 363 genes were downregulated (≥2-fold, p < 0.05) in thornless key lime compared to key lime. We focused on transcription factors with preferential expression in developing thorns. Among them is TI1 , an ortholog of the Arabidopsis BRC1 gene, encoding a class II TCP-family transcription factor ( Figure S4 A). TCP transcription factors have been implicated in the regulation of lateral meristem growth and cell proliferation in a variety of contexts as well as in modulating hormone action [ 25 ], making TI1 an attractive candidate for controlling thorn development. BRC1 orthologs have been shown to participate in the regulation of axillary bud outgrowth and branching in a variety of species [ 25–31 ], but have not been previously implicated in thorn outgrowth. Quantitative real-time PCR validation of the transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the C. aurantiifolia TI1 gene was expressed more highly in key lime shoot tips as compared to those of thornless key lime ( Figure 3 D). Similarly, TI1 was also significantly less expressed in a thornless isolate of Citrus reticulata (mandarin “W. Murcott”) as compared to mandarin ( Figures 3 C and 3D). In Carrizo citrange, TI1 transcripts were preferentially expressed in the thorn tip ( Figures 3 E–3G, S3 B, and S3C). TI1 expression was first seen in stage 8 thorn primordia, and was maintained in the thorn primordium until later stages of thorn differentiation. Both temporally and spatially, the TI1 expression pattern was largely complementary to that of CsWUS in developing thorn primordia. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach optimized for Citrus [ 32 , 33 ], we targeted Carrizo citrange TI1 using three distinct guide RNAs (gRNAs) ( Figure 3 H). We recovered three independent plants for each gRNA which, by sequence analyses, were non-chimeric and contained biallelic or homozygous mutations at the TI1 locus ( Table S2 ). These ti1 mutant plants showed a transformation of thorns into branches, with over 10% of thorns showing such a transformation ( Figures 3 I–3M). Most thorn primordia in the ti1 mutant plants showed some degree of abnormal growth, suggesting a partial transformation ( Figure 3 M). In addition, the ti1 plants showed an increase in branching, reflecting outgrowth of axillary meristems in addition to the transformation of thorns into branches ( Figure 3 M). Downregulation of TI1 in Carrizo citrange using an RNAi approach confirmed the requirement of TI1 for thorn determinacy. An RNAi construct containing the TI1 coding sequence was transformed into Carrizo citrange and five resulting transgenic plants were recovered that showed a partial transformation of thorns into branches, consisting of a radially symmetric thorn-like outgrowth with an indeterminate tip that produced one or more leaves ( Figures 3 N–3R). In addition, these plants showed a modest increase in axillary branching ( Figure 3 R). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses of two of these RNAi plants indicated that TI1 expression was reduced to approximately 40% of controls ( Figure 3 S). TI2 Also Has a Role in Specifying Thorn Identity Examination of the C. sinensis genome revealed the presence of two closely related class II TCP-family paralogs of TI1 , termed TI2 and TCP1 ( Figure S4 A). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that TI2 was expressed in a similar fashion to TI1 , with strong expression detectable in young thorn primordia ( Figure S3 C). In situ hybridizations showed that expression of TI2 was first detectable in stage 7 thorn primordia, and maintained in much of the primordium through stage 10 ( Figures 4 A–4D), suggesting TI2 may also have a role in specifying thorn identity. TI2 expression was also observed in the associated axillary meristem and in the surrounding bract ( Figures 4 A–4D). We generated TI2 CRISPR-induced mutants using two distinct gRNAs ( Figure 4 E), and recovered three independent homozygous or biallelic mutant plants for each gRNA ( Table S2 ). The ti2 mutants showed a low but detectable (~6%) frequency of thorns transformed into branches ( Figures 4 F–4J). In contrast to ti1 mutants, the ti2 mutants displayed considerable outgrowth of the axillary meristems into branches, as well as promoting the outgrowth of the bracts into unifoliate leaves ( Figures 4 I and 4J). To confirm that the phenotypes we observed for TI1 and TI2 were specific, we also carried out CRISPR-induced mutagenesis of TCP1 ( Figure S4 B). We did not observe any disruption of plant architecture in the three tcp1 mutants recovered ( Figures S4 C and S4D). We generated ti1 ti2 double mutants using a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 approach ( Figure 5 A). We recovered six independent double mutants, all of which showed a dramatic transformation of almost every thorn into a branch ( Figures 5 B–5I). These double mutants also displayed enhanced branch outgrowth from axillary meristems and outgrowth of the associated bracts into leaves, resulting in extremely bushy plants ( Figure 5 I). We also generated ti1 ti2 tcp1 triple mutants and those mutants showed the same phenotype as ti1 ti2 double mutants, supporting the idea that TCP1 does not play a redundant role in thorn development ( Figures S4 E–S4H). Together, these results demonstrate that TI1 and TI2 act partially redundantly in controlling thorn identity and shoot branching. TI1 and TI2 Regulate CsWUS Expression The morphological changes associated with the conversion of thorns into branches in the ti1 ti2 mutants began to be evident by stage 8, the stage at which CsWUS is normally downregulated in thorn primordia ( Figure 6 A). Furthermore, CsWUS expression was significantly enhanced in ti1 , ti2 , and ti1 ti2 mutants, indicating that TI1 and TI2 act as negative regulators of CsWUS transcription ( Figure 6 B). We confirmed this downregulation using a dual-luciferase assay in Citrus protoplasts, in which CsWUS promoter activity was significantly reduced when either TI1 or TI2 was overexpressed ( Figures 6 C and 6D). We surveyed 3.2 kb upstream of the start of translation of the CsWUS gene and defined two potential TI binding sites ( Figure 6 E, P1 and P2), each containing a GGCCC core consensus binding sequence for class II TCP transcription factors [ 34–36 ]. Mutation of the P1 but not the P2 element disrupted the regulation of the CsWUS promoter by TI1 in dual-luciferase assays ( Figures 6 E and 6F). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses using Citrus protoplasts transfected with a 35S:TI1-eGFP construct showed strong enrichment for the binding of TI1 to both P1 (15-fold) and P2 (8-fold) regions of the CsWUS promoter but not to the CsWUS 3′ region, which lacks a TCP consensus binding site ( Figure 6 G). ChIP assays using young Carrizo citrange shoots and a polyclonal anti-TI1 antibody confirmed the binding of TI1 protein to both P1 and P2 regions of the CsWUS promoter ( Figure S5 ). We confirmed the sequence-specific binding of the TI1 protein to the P1 and P2 promoter elements by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays in which TI1 binding was competed out using a 20-fold excess of wild-type (WT) but not mutant P1 oligonucleotides; TI1 binding was only weakly abrogated in the presence of a mutant P2 competitor oligonucleotide ( Figure 6 H). Together, these results indicate that TI1 binding to the P1 site of the CsWUS promoter is critical for its downregulation. To demonstrate a functional requirement for the temporal downregulation of CsWUS in promoting thorn determinacy, we transiently overexpressed CsWUS in Carrizo citrange plants containing a 35S:CsWUS-GR construct. Four out of 12 plants showed fasciated stems after dexamethasone (DEX) induction of CsWUS protein activity. In these fasciated stems, thorn outgrowth was blocked and there was little expansion of leaf primordia ( Figures 6 I, 6J, and S6 ), suggesting that overproliferation of stem cells disrupted shoot and thorn development. A similar DEX-inducible phenotype was observed in 3 out of 6 transgenic Carrizo citrange plants containing a CsWUS-GR construct under the control of a 4.1-kb TI1 promoter region ( Figures 6 K, 6L, and S6 ). We regenerated Carrizo citrange plants containing a proTI1:CsWUS construct, and observed four lines that had fasciated stems and reduced leaf outgrowth, which failed to root ( Figure S6 ). Nevertheless, we successfully recovered seven lines with less severe phenotypes; in four of these lines approximately 30% of the thorn meristems were converted into axillary meristems ( Figure S6 ). We also observed thorn outgrowth defects similar to those of the ti1 mutant (~20%) in these plants. Furthermore, we observed the thorn transformed into the branch phenotype in transgenic Carrizo citrange plants containing the proWUS ( mP1 ) :WUS construct but not in those plants containing the proWUS:WUS construct, suggesting that termination of CsWUS expression by TI1 is critical for thorn identity ( Figure S7 ). Discussion We have established the thorn as a new model system in which to study vegetative meristem determinacy. Whereas reproductive meristem determinacy, and concomitant stem cell arrest, has been well studied [ 37 , 38 ], analyses of vegetative determinacy have been quite limited. We have characterized thorn development in Carrizo citrange, and have shown that TI1 and TI2 , encoding two CYC/BRC1 class TCP transcription factors, are thorn identity genes. Stage-dependent downregulation of CsWUS expression by TI1 and TI2 is critical for thorn development ( Figure 7 ). We have observed that CsWUS expression is downregulated by stage 8 of thorn development; TI1 expression is first observed at this stage. If TI1 is mutated, CsWUS activity is retained in the thorn primordium, as in the axillary meristem, and so continued growth ensues. As such, the TI-CsWUS pathway in Citrus thorns is similar to the AG-WUS pathway in Arabidopsis floral development [ 9 , 39 ] in terms of terminating WUS transcriptional expression as a component of the determinacy pathway. Furthermore, we found that TI1 binds directly to the P1 site of the CsWUS promoter. The P1 binding site is not present in the A. thaliana WUS promoter, suggesting that thorn development was predicated in part upon the evolution of the P1 site within the Malvidae. It remains to be determined whether thorn development in other angiosperm clades depends on a similar direct transcriptional repression mechanism at the WUS promoter. Our work has also revealed the surprisingly distinct developmental trajectories of the adjacent thorn meristem and axillary meristem. Citrus thorns arise in a phyllotaxy that is offset to the subtending leaf axil, which likely reflects the interplay of auxin, cytokinin, and strigolactone action at the node [ 16 , 40 , 41 ]. This interplay presumably results in the differing expression patterns of the TI genes in the axillary meristem as opposed to the thorn meristem. In effect, thorn development would be the result of a heterochronic shift in TI expression; why this shift occurs only in Citrus thorn meristems and not the neighboring axillary meristems is as yet unknown. In response to TI1 and TI2 expression, there must be additional factors at play that distinguish between the axillary meristem and thorn meristem. Citrus thorn primordia grow continuously from their inception for a period of time, whereas the axillary meristems generally remain dormant. Thorn primordia are unresponsive to decapitation, whereas decapitation and the concomitant release from apical dominance promote axillary bud outgrowth. During axillary bud dormancy, BRC1 homologs have been shown to regulate auxin and ABA signaling [ 42–44 ]. We suggest that the differential expression of TI genes in the axillary meristem versus the thorn meristem may affect hormone signaling in each meristem in a distinct manner, resulting in differential growth patterns. The CYC / BRC1 clade genes have a conserved role in suppressing axillary bud outgrowth in both monocots and eudicots [ 45 ]. Surprisingly, CYC / BRC1 clade genes in the Cucurbitaceae ( TEN in Cucumis sativus and CmTCP1 in Cucumis melo ) have a critical role in shoot-derived tendril development [ 46–48 ]. Like mutations in TI1 and TI2 in Citrus that transform thorns into branches, mutations in Cucumis TEN or CmTCP1 result in conversion of tendrils to branches. These studies together suggest that during evolution, plants repurpose the use of CYC / BRC1 clade genes for the control of specific aspects of axillary growth in addition to a default role in branching inhibition. It remains to be determined whether a TCP - WUS regulatory module also operates to control tendril identity in Cucurbitaceae. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms controlling stem cell maintenance and proliferative growth during determinate development. Genetic alterations of plant architecture can increase crop yields, and the tuning of the TI - WUS pathway could be used to rationally design specific agronomic improvements not only in Citrus but potentially in many crop species.

Data and Code Availability Raw gene expression data and processed reads are available through the BioProject accession ID PRJNA605016. Experimental Model and Subject Details Carrizo citrange ( Citrus sinensis ‘Washington’ sweet orange X Poncirus trifoliata ) was used as the experimental model. Carrizo citrange seeds were purchased from Lyn Citrus Seed. W. Murcott mandarin ( Citrus reticulata Blanco) seeds were obtained from USDA ARS, Nat’l Clonal Germplasm Repository for Citrus & Dates. Thornless W. Murcott mandarin was identified as a sport from around 40 seedlings. Cuttings from Citrus aurantiifolia key lime (hereafter referred to as TK), and Citrus aurantiifolia thornless key lime (hereafter referred to as TLK) were kept in an environmentally controlled growth chamber (24°C, 16 h light/8 h dark) at Yale. Plants over one year old were moved to a greenhouse at Marsh Botanical Garden at Yale. For observation of thorn production in Carrizo citrange, seeds were soaked in water overnight and germinated in turface clay, at 24°C under a 16 h day/8 h night regime and grown under these conditions. Emergence of the seedlings occurred within 2 weeks and the plants were then watered three times a week with water and supplemented twice a month with fertilizer (20:10:20) and chelated iron. For decapitation experiments, 20-week old plants with 18 to 25 nodes were decapitated between nodes number 18-20 and growth of the branches was scored 3 weeks later. For DEX treatments, transgenic Carrizo citrange plants with the p35S:CsWUS-GR construct were micro-grafted to Carrizo citrange root stock and well established plants were both sprayed and watered with 20 μM dexamethasone (DEX) or ethanol (0.1%, MOCK) twice a week. Plants were treated for 2 months and phenotypes were documented. Similar treatments were performed for pTI1:CsWUS-GR transgenic plants except that those plants were rooted but not grafted, and treatments lasted 1 month. Method Details Plasmid constructions and plant transformation CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing constructs were produced by using a binary vector expressing hSpCas9 under the Arabidopsis YAO promoter as previously described [ 33 ]. In brief, the primers used to insert the different sgRNAs were synthesized and annealed, and then were ligated to an AtU6-26-sgRNA-SK vector. The AtU6-26 promoter with gRNA was then transferred to the proYAO-Cas9-NOS binary vector. For multiplex genome editing, additional AtU6-26-gRNA cassettes were added to the final vector at the Spe I site. To generate a TI1 -RNAi construct, TI1 CDS was amplified and cloned into a pDONR207 vector then transferred into the binary vector pK7GWIWG2D(II) containing a CaMV 35S promoter (p35S). To generate CsWUS inducible overexpression constructs, CsWUS and GR were fused in-frame by overlapping PCR and cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO vector. The CsWUS -GR fragment was then transferred into the binary vector pK7WG2D to generate the p 35S:CsWUS-GR construct. To place CsWUS - GR under the control of the TI1 promoter, we first mutated the Sac I site within CsWUS CDS without disrupting amino acid coding. The CsWUS CDS and a GR fragment (aa 508-795) was fused together by overlapping PCR and cloned into a pGEMT-easy vector (Promega) with Asc I and Sac I sites. The CsWUS - GR fragment with Asc I and Sac I sites was used to replace the GUS gene of a modified pMDC164 vector, in which the hygromycin phosphotransferase II ( hptII ) selection marker gene was replaced by GFP- neomycin phosphotransferase II ( nptII ) selection marker gene containing a GFP reporter for visual selection. Finally, a TI1 upstream promoter (4144 bp) in pDONR207 vector was transferred into the 164-CsWUS-GR vector to generate the pTI1 : CsWUS-GR construct. The pTI1 : CsWUS construct was generated in a similar manner except that no GR sequence was involved. To construct the pCsWUS:CsWUS , and pCsWUS(mP1):CsWUS , the CsWUS CDS was cloned at the Asc I and Sac I sites of the modified pMDC164 vector as described above. A 1280 bp fragment of the CsWUS promoter was inserted in the sense orientation at the Sac I site. Then a 3212 bp CsWUS upstream promoter with or without mutations in the P1 site was transferred to the pMDC164- CsWUS -3′ by LR reaction to make the pCsWUS(mP1):CsWUS and pCsWUS:CsWUS constructs, respectively. Table S1 contains sequences of oligonucleotides used for cloning. All binary constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. Carrizo citrange plant transformation was performed as previously described [ 33 , 53 ]. Transgenic plants were selected by kanamycin and the GFP visual marker. Only non-mosaic transgenic plants were rooted and kept for further analysis. Transactivation assay in Carrizo citrange Protoplasts Transient expression constructs were generated as previously described [ 54 ]. In brief, TI1 or TI2 CDS was cloned into the pDONR207 vector, and then transferred to p2GW7 vector for transient overexpression. For eGFP tagged TI1, eGFP was fused in-frame to TI1 by overlapping PCR. For YFP tagged TI2, TI2 CDS from pDONR207 was transferred to pEARLEYGATE 104 vector (containing YFP at the N terminus with a CaMV 35S promoter) by LR reaction to generate the 104-TI2 construct. A pGREEN800II-60LUC vector was constructed as described [ 55 ], except that the 60 base pair minimal 35S fragment was inserted in the Sac II and Nco I sites. A 3212 bp. CsWUS upstream promoter was PCR amplified from Carrizo citrange genomic DNA and cloned into the pGEMT-easy vector. The CsWUS promoter with the mutated TI1 binding sites was generated by Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs). The mutated CsWUS promoters were confirmed by sequencing. The CsWUS promoter or its mutated versions were inserted into the SalI and PstI sites in the pGREEN800II-60LUC vector. All reporter and effector constructs were prepared using Plasmid Plus Midi Kit (QIAGEN). Table S1 contains sequences of oligonucleotides used for cloning. Young Carrizo citrange leaves were cut by fresh razor blades and submerged in 0.5 M mannitol solution. The leaves were then transferred to an enzyme solution containing 0.4 M mannitol, 20 mM KCl, 20 mM MES, pH5.7, 0.015 g/mL Cellulose RS, 0.02 g/mL Macerozyme R10, 10 mM CaCl 2 , 0.351 μL/mL 2-Mercaptoethanol, and 0.001 g/mL BSA. Leaves in the enzyme solution were vacuum infiltrated for 10 min and then left on a platform shaker for 16-20 h with gentle mshaking at 50 rpm at room temperature. The protoplast solution was filtered through a mesh with pore size of 150 μm. Protoplasts were then washed, resuspended and transfected exactly as previously described [ 56 ]. Carrizo citrange protoplasts were incubated for 10-14 h in darkness. Detection of luciferase activity was performed by using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega). Antibody Generation and purification The full-length TI1 coding sequence was cloned into pMBP-28b vector with the Nco I and Hin d III sites for His-MBP-TI1 fusion protein expression or into pGEX4T-1 vector with Bam H I and SalI sites for GST-TI1 fusion protein expression. All proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) E.coli by inducing with 0.5 mM IPTG at 16°C for 16 h. His-MBP-TI1 was purified on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) while GST-TI1 protein was purified on Glutathione Sepharose 4B GST-tagged protein purification resin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Purified His-MBP-TI1 protein was injected into two guinea pigs (Cocalico), and the serum was affinity purified using the GST-TI1 protein, as described by Chuck et al. [ 57 ]. Western blot analyses Approximately 20 μg of GW7-TI1-GFP or 104-TI2 construct was used to transfect around 2 × 10 6 Carrizo citrange leaf protoplasts. Protoplasts were harvested and boiled in 30 μL 2 × SDS sample buffer. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected by an anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, ab290). The same blot was stripped and then treated with anti-TI1 antibody. Similar results were obtained from 3 experiments. Chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP-PCR assays were performed by using affinity purified TI1 antibody as previously described with minor modifications [ 58 ]. Briefly, approximately 1 g of actively growing Carrizo citrange apices was ground in fine powder in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was cross-linked with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde in 30 mL of ChIP extraction buffer 1 (0.4 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8.0) for 10 min. 2 mL of 2 M glycine was then added to quench the cross-linking for 5 min. The solution was filtered through layers of Miracloth (EMD Millipore) and then the nuclei were pelleted (3000 g, 20 min at 4°C). The pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer 2 (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8.0). Nuclei and debris were pelleted (12,000 g, 10 min at 4°C). The pellet was resuspended in 500 μL extraction buffer 3 (1.7 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.15% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8.0) and then overlaid on 600 μL extraction buffer 3 and centrifuged for 1 h at 16,000 g at 4°C. The chromatin pellet was resuspended in 300 μL nuclei lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA and 1% SDS, pH 8.0). Chromatin was sonicated in a Bioruptor (Diagenode) for 20 min (30 s on, 30 s off, high level) to yield DNA fragments of 0.3-1.0 kb in length. The sonicated suspension was centrifuged at 12000 g for 5 min at 4°C. 10 μL of the supernatant was kept to serve as input. 3 mL of ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl, 1.2 mM EDTA, 167 mM NaCl, and 1.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) was added to the supernatant. The chromatin sample was precleared with Dynabeads protein A and then incubated with either TI1 antibody or non-immune serum overnight at 4°C. The immune complexes were collected with Dynabeads protein A for 1 h at 4°C and then washed by low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, LiCl wash buffer and TE buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by 100 μL elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO3) at 65°C for 30 min, followed by reverse crosslinking, RNase A treatment and proteinase K treatment. DNA was purified by ChIP DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research). Purified DNA was subjected to qPCR analysis using primers listed at Table S1 . The final relative enrichment fold changes were calculated by normalizing % input of each primer pair against the control gene (beta- tubulin ). In Carrizo citrange leaf protoplasts, ChIP assays were performed as described previously [ 54 , 59 ]. Approximately 50 μg of the p35S:TI1-eGFP construct was transformed into 2 × 10 7 Carrizo citrange leaf protoplasts, which were incubated at room temperature for 10 h. Protoplasts were collected and resuspended with W5 medium with 1% formaldehyde for cross-linking at room temperature for 20 min, and then were quenched with 0.2 M glycine for 5 min. Nuclei were extracted in extraction buffer 1 as described above and lysed in 300 μL nuclei lysis buffer. The rest of the ChIP steps were carried exactly as described above except that anti-GFP (Abcam, ab290) or anti-HA (Sigma, H6908) antibodies were used for the immunoprecipitation. Each experiment was repeated three times and similar results were obtained. Histology Plant material was manually dissected and fixed in 10% formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid, 50% ethanol (FAA), for 1 h under vacuum and on ice. Fresh FAA was added to the samples and incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. Samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series before critical point drying; samples were then sputter coated with gold and images were captured on a Zeiss ISI-SS40 scanning electron microscope equipped with digital image capture. Detection of lignin was carried out on 8 micron sections that had been dewaxed, rehydrated and stained with phloroglucinol-HCl (1 volume of 2% (w/v) phloroglucinol in 95% ethanol with 1 volume of concentrated HCl) and mounted under a coverslip. Stained material was photographed within 30 min of staining. RNA-seq Young shoot tips (approximately 5 mm long) were collected from actively flushing branches of trees (thorned or thornless key lime). For each variety, three samples corresponding to a pool of three young shoots were used for RNA extraction. RNA was then extracted using TRizol reagent (Life Technology, USA) and was further cleaned using DNase I and RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, USA). The mRNA was enriched through mRNA purification kit (Dynabeads mRNA purification kit, Invitrogen) or rRNA depletion kit (Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit, Plant Leaf, Epicenter) following the manufacturer’s recommendation. Quality of the purified mRNA and total RNA (rRNA depleted) was verified on a Bioanalyzer using the RNA Pico assay and RNA concentration was determined in parallel using a low range Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA assay kit (Life Technology, USA). Paired end, directional libraries were prepared with the ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicenter) by using 5ng of RNA (polyA enriched or rRNA-depleted). Individual barcodes were added to each sample. PCR products ranging in size between 250-500bp were purified using AMPure system Agencourt (Beckman Coulter) and quality of the products was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer using the High Sensitivity DNA assay. The 12 individually barcoded libraries were pooled, loaded in one lane of the flow cell of a HiSeq2000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) and run at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI, USA). Raw reads were filtered using fastq-m cf [ 60 ]. Reads with quality score above 20 were kept. Cleaned reads of each cultivar were pooled and used for de novo transcriptome assembly with the Trinity program [ 61 ] and CLC Workbench Genomics to generate transcripts. Reference database for quality assessment were made from Citrus transcriptomes/ genomes publicly available ( https://www.citrusgenomedb.org ). The open reading frames were predicted and translated in proteins with the TransDecoder utility ( https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/releases ). Raw reads from each of the libraries were mapped against the Trinity reconstructed transcripts in CLC with the following parameters: at least 80% identity over 50% of the read. The alignment was subsequently used for RSEM [ 62 ] analysis to estimate transcript abundance. In order to reduce the redundancy of assemblies, each of the species proteome was de-duplicated using USEARCH [ 63 ]. USEARCH clustering was then performed re-iteratively at 100%, 97%, 95%, 90% and 50% identity. The clustering was done by starting with the most stringent criteria, then using the centroids (longest) sequence of the clusters as the sequences to cluster at the next level. Different types of cluster classes were defined to illustrate the possible combinations of orthologs, isoforms and paralogs across the 5 species and the percentage identity at which the orthologs clustered. In addition, orthoMCL [ 64 ] clustering was performed with filters set at 50% identity and 80% and 95% length. The clustering method uses reciprocal best blast hits to generate the clusters. Analyses of differential expression including FDR calculations were performed using the Bioconductor package edgeR [ 65 ]. Each condition was compared in a pairwise fashion. Peptide annotations were transferred by BLAST. First, peptides were submitted to a first BLASTX analysis against the TAIR10 proteins database. The remaining peptides with no Arabidopsis hits were then used for a BLASTX analysis against UniPROT filtered for plant proteins and with Arabidopsis proteins removed. GO annotation of the matching Arabidopsis peptides were retrieved using ThaleMine ( https://apps.araport.org/thalemine/bag.do ). Lists of transcription factors used for analyses were retrieved from the PlantTFdb web site ( http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/ ). Expression analysis Total RNA was extracted from samples of tissues using a Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (ZYMO Research) with DNase I treatment to remove any contaminating DNA. One microgram of RNA from each sample was used to generate cDNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). qPCR analyses were carried out with a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad) using iQ SYBR Green supermix (BioRad). Actin was used as a reference gene and relative expression values were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCt method. Fold change and standard error was calculated from three biological replicates. In situ hybridization Plant apices were fixed and dehydrated as described above. CsSTM , CsWUS , TI1 , TI2 and HISTONEH4 fragments were amplified from Carrizo citrange cDNA from Carrizo citrange shoot tips, using primers listed in Table S1 , and sub-cloned into the pGEMT-easy vector following the manufacturer’s recommendations (Promega). Antisense probes were synthesized from the SP6 promoter using Roche reagent and hydrolyzed to 120 bp long fragments. In situ hybridizations were performed essentially as previously described [ 66 ]. Electrophoresis mobility gel shift assay (EMSA) The fragments of CsWUS promoter labeled with 3′ biotin were synthesized by the Keck facility at Yale University. Unlabeled oligos were used for the competition assays. Purified MBP or His-MBP-TI1 were used in the EMSA. EMSA was performed as described previously [ 67 ]. Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method implemented on MEGA7 after alignment using MUSCLE [ 68 ]. A complete list of sequences used to generate the CYC / BRC1 phylogeny is available in Table S3 . Quantification and Statistical Analysis For thorn frequency analysis ( Figure S1 A), 84 independent plants were assayed. For branch meristem outgrowth analysis ( Figure S1 B), 12 non-decapitated and 19 decapitated plants were assayed. For gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR (as shown in Figures 3 D, 3S, and 6 B), three replicates were assayed. For transient assays in leaf protoplasts (as shown in Figures 6 D and 6F), at least three independent biological experiments were performed. For ChIP-qPCR analysis (as shown in Figures 6 G and S5 B), at least three independent biological experiments were performed. Statistical analysis was performed through Student’s t test in Excel.
