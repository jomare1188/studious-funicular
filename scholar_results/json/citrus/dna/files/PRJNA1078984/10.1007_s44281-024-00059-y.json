    "full_text": "Abstract Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) enhance nutrient accessibility and offer disease protection, conferring significant advantages to host plants. Although considerable progress has been made in PGPR research, efficient acquisition of PGPR remains challenging, primarily due to the absence of a microbial biobank, especially for perennial woody crops like citrus. Through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, this study analyzed rhizobacterial communities from five citrus-producing regions in China, identifying 9,887 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) across 28 rhizobacterial phyla. Subsequently, a citrus rhizosphere microbial biobank was established, comprising 3,142 bacterial strains, through extensive isolation of citrus rhizobacteria. From this collection, 269 potential PGPR were screened from 435 bacterial taxa based on their production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophore synthesis, phosphate solubilization, and their effects on Arabidopsis root growth. Further evaluation of 22 selected PGPR strains via pot-culture inoculation on citrus and tomato seedlings demonstrated that 11 strains significantly enhanced plant growth. This study provides a foundational theoretical and technological framework for advancing the development and application of beneficial rhizobacteria in citrus agriculture."

            "text": "The rhizosphere is a highly active and dynamic region profoundly shaped by root activity (Chieb and Gachomo 9 ). Among its microbial inhabitants, rhizobacteria represent the most abundant microorganisms, with certain strains playing critical roles in plant growth, development, and resilience against abiotic and biotic stresses (Egamberdieva et al. 14 ). Such rhizobacteria beneficial for host plants are defined as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)."

            "text": "PGPR enhance plant growth through mechanisms such as phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, biological nitrogen fixation, phytohormone synthesis, antifungal activity, and the production of volatile organic compounds (Bhattacharyya and Jha 4 ). Given the significant impact of PGPR, extensive studies have isolated and characterized these bacteria in various plants, including Arabidopsis (Lundberg et al. 33 ; Bai et al. 2 ; Durán et al. 11 ), soybean (Hartman et al. 18 ; Wang et al. 50 ), tomato (Kwak et al. 27 ), rice (Edwards et al. 13 ; Zhang et al. 58 ), maize (Peiffera et al. 36 ; Niu et al. 34 ), wheat (Youseif et al. 55 ), common bean (Pérez-Jaramillo et al. 38 , 39 ), cucumber (Islam et al. 21 ; Wang et al. 49 ), barley (Bulgarelli et al. 6 ), and garlic (Zhuang et al. 62 ). These investigations have led to the identification of numerous PGPR that improve nutrient uptake (Zhang et al. 58 ; Wang et al. 50 ), stimulate growth and development (Islam et al. 21 ; Zhuang et al. 62 ), and bolster resistance to various stresses (Lee et al. 28 ; Zhou et al. 59 ). Although the rhizosphere holds considerable potential for large-scale PGPR isolation and characterization, most research has focused predominantly on annual herbaceous plants like Arabidopsis and rice, with limited studies addressing perennial woody species. While certain PGPR may have similar effects across different plant species, significant differences in rhizobacterial composition and function have been observed between annual herbaceous plants and perennial woody plants (Ling et al. 30 ). Perennial woody plants, compared to their annual herbaceous counterparts, generally exhibit larger root systems and extended lifespans (Bertola et al. 3 ). These larger root networks provide more carbohydrates to the rhizosphere, enhancing rhizobacterial activity and community dynamics over time (Bai et al. 2 ; Ginnan et al. 17 ). Thus, isolating and characterizing rhizobacteria in perennial woody plants promises to enrich our understanding of the root microbiome and extend the exploration and application of beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms."

            "text": "Citrus stands as one of the world’s most significant perennial fruit crops (Zhang et al. 56 , 57 ). However, citrus cultivation faces numerous challenges, including nutrient deficiencies and susceptibility to disease (Wang et al. 48 ). Recognizing the potential of rhizobacteria in citrus cultivation, extensive research has focused on exploring the citrus rhizosphere microbiome (Xu et al. 52 ; Castellano-Hinojosa et al. 7 ), rhizosphere-enriched bacterial communities (Trivedi et al. 46 ), and root-associated endophytic microorganisms (Trivedi et al. 45 ) through high-throughput sequencing of 16S/ITS and/or metagenomic technologies. These studies suggest that the citrus rhizosphere harbors a rich diversity of potential PGPR. Nevertheless, few PGPR have been isolated to evaluate their functional roles and underlying mechanisms in citrus, primarily due to the lack of a comprehensive citrus rhizobacterial biobank."

Sampling followed a standardized protocol (Xu et al. 52 ), involving the selection of 5–8 healthy citrus trees per orchard. The top 5 cm of soil was first removed, and fine roots (approximately 1 mm diameter) were collected from a depth of 5–15 cm. Roots were gently shaken to discard loosely attached soil before being placed in pre-cooled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Rhizosphere soil was extracted by ultrasonic treatment following a previously described method (Bai et al. 2 ): roots underwent sonication twice for 10 min each (15-s interval) in a sonication bath. The soil-PBS suspension, devoid of roots, was then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, with the resulting rhizosphere soil pellet divided into two parts. One half was used for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing, while the other was re-suspended in sterile PBS, mixed with an equal volume of 60% glycerol, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C for subsequent bacterial isolation. In total, 35 rhizosphere soil samples were obtained from the five citrus-growing regions (Fig. S 1 and Table S1)."

Bacterial strains were subsequently inoculated into the tomato rhizosphere during transplanting. For bacterial inoculation, citrus seedlings were grown in a greenhouse, while tomato seedlings were cultured in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Bacterial strains were first cultured on LB agar plates at 28 °C for 3 days in a biochemical incubator, followed by resuspension in liquid LB medium for 12 h in a shaker at 28 °C and 180 rpm/min. A 5 mL bacterial suspension (OD 600 = 0.2, log 10 CFU/mL ≈ 8) was inoculated into the rhizosphere of citrus and tomato plants at two time points: immediately upon transplanting (0 days) and 7 days post-transplanting, to ensure successful bacterial colonization. Tomato plant height was measured 4 weeks after pot culture, and citrus plant height was recorded at 8 weeks."

Sampling followed a standardized protocol (Xu et al. 52 ), involving the selection of 5–8 healthy citrus trees per orchard. The top 5 cm of soil was first removed, and fine roots (approximately 1 mm diameter) were collected from a depth of 5–15 cm. Roots were gently shaken to discard loosely attached soil before being placed in pre-cooled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Rhizosphere soil was extracted by ultrasonic treatment following a previously described method (Bai et al. 2 ): roots underwent sonication twice for 10 min each (15-s interval) in a sonication bath. The soil-PBS suspension, devoid of roots, was then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, with the resulting rhizosphere soil pellet divided into two parts. One half was used for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing, while the other was re-suspended in sterile PBS, mixed with an equal volume of 60% glycerol, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C for subsequent bacterial isolation. In total, 35 rhizosphere soil samples were obtained from the five citrus-growing regions (Fig. S 1 and Table S1)."

IAA production: Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production was quantified using the Salkowski method, following a previously described method (Wang et al. 50 ). Bacterial strains were cultured in liquid LB medium at 28 °C for four days, after which the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant collected. One mL of supernatant was mixed with two mL of Salkowski's reagent (2% FeCl 3 in 35% HClO 4 solution) and left in the dark for 30 min. A pink color indicated IAA production. Siderophore production: Siderophore production was detected using the Chrome Azurol S (CAS) agar method (Liu et al. 31 ). A 10 μL aliquot of bacterial culture was inoculated onto CAS agar plates and incubated at 28 °C for 3–5 days. A yellow-orange halo surrounding the inoculation site signified siderophore production. Root development: The impact of bacterial strains on root development was tested through co-cultivation with Arabidopsis seedlings. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 2% NaOCl for 15 min, rinsed five times with sterile water, and then transferred to Petri dishes containing 1/2 MS medium.

Interestingly, a significant difference in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was observed between perennial woody plants and annual herbaceous plants. Proteobacteria was more abundant in the rhizospheres of perennial woody plants (Student’s t -test: p = 0.0162), while the relative abundance of Planctomycetes (top 7, Student’s t -test: p = 0.0006) and Nitrospirae (top 10, Student’s t -test: p = 0.0300) were higher in annual herbaceous plants (Fig. 2 a).

The pronounced growth-promoting effects of Proteobacteria may be due to several factors. First, Proteobacteria has been associated with high levels of beta-glucosidase (betaG) enzyme activity, which aids in the utilization of glucose accumulated in the rhizosphere (Bertola et al. 3 ). Compared to annual herbaceous plants, perennial woody plants, with more developed root systems and higher carbohydrate accumulation, may favor the growth of such nutrient-rich microorganisms, such as the Proteobacteria bacteria (Johnston-Monje et al. 25 ; Fan et al. 15 ).

Only four strains (30D3, 2H3, 2L2, and 3K4) demonstrated growth-promoting effects in both citrus and tomato species (Fig. 6 , Fig. S2).

The observed species-specific growth-promoting effects (Fig. 6 , Fig. S2) suggest that rhizosphere microbial functions may vary depending on the host plant, highlighting the importance of identifying crop-specific beneficial microbes. Notably, the citrus rhizosphere microbial biobank contains a substantial representation of Burkholderia strains (within the Proteobacteria phylum), which are absent in the rhizosphere microbial biobanks of Arabidopsis (Bai et al. 2 ) and rice (Zhang et al. 58 ). Given the recognized role of Burkholderia in enhancing plant growth, development, and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses (Pal et al. 35 ), these strains may hold particular significance for citrus cultivation, offering promising avenues for crop-specific microbial applications."

    "full_text": "Introduction The rhizosphere is a highly active and dynamic region profoundly shaped by root activity (Chieb and Gachomo 9 ). Among its microbial inhabitants, rhizobacteria represent the most abundant microorganisms, with certain strains playing critical roles in plant growth, development, and resilience against abiotic and biotic stresses (Egamberdieva et al. 14 ). Such rhizobacteria beneficial for host plants are defined as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). PGPR enhance plant growth through mechanisms such as phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, biological nitrogen fixation, phytohormone synthesis, antifungal activity, and the production of volatile organic compounds (Bhattacharyya and Jha 4 ). Given the significant impact of PGPR, extensive studies have isolated and characterized these bacteria in various plants, including Arabidopsis (Lundberg et al. 33 ; Bai et al. 2 ; Durán et al. 11 ), soybean (Hartman et al. 18 ; Wang et al. 50 ), tomato (Kwak et al. 27 ), rice (Edwards et al. 13 ; Zhang et al. 58 ), maize (Peiffera et al. 36 ; Niu et al. 34 ), wheat (Youseif et al. 55 ), common bean (Pérez-Jaramillo et al. 38 , 39 ), cucumber (Islam et al. 21 ; Wang et al. 49 ), barley (Bulgarelli et al. 6 ), and garlic (Zhuang et al. 62 ). These investigations have led to the identification of numerous PGPR that improve nutrient uptake (Zhang et al. 58 ; Wang et al. 50 ), stimulate growth and development (Islam et al. 21 ; Zhuang et al. 62 ), and bolster resistance to various stresses (Lee et al. 28 ; Zhou et al. 59 ). Although the rhizosphere holds considerable potential for large-scale PGPR isolation and characterization, most research has focused predominantly on annual herbaceous plants like Arabidopsis and rice, with limited studies addressing perennial woody species. While certain PGPR may have similar effects across different plant species, significant differences in rhizobacterial composition and function have been observed between annual herbaceous plants and perennial woody plants (Ling et al. 30 ). Perennial woody plants, compared to their annual herbaceous counterparts, generally exhibit larger root systems and extended lifespans (Bertola et al. 3 ). These larger root networks provide more carbohydrates to the rhizosphere, enhancing rhizobacterial activity and community dynamics over time (Bai et al. 2 ; Ginnan et al. 17 ). Thus, isolating and characterizing rhizobacteria in perennial woody plants promises to enrich our understanding of the root microbiome and extend the exploration and application of beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms. Citrus stands as one of the world’s most significant perennial fruit crops (Zhang et al. 56 , 57 ). However, citrus cultivation faces numerous challenges, including nutrient deficiencies and susceptibility to disease (Wang et al. 48 ). Recognizing the potential of rhizobacteria in citrus cultivation, extensive research has focused on exploring the citrus rhizosphere microbiome (Xu et al. 52 ; Castellano-Hinojosa et al. 7 ), rhizosphere-enriched bacterial communities (Trivedi et al. 46 ), and root-associated endophytic microorganisms (Trivedi et al. 45 ) through high-throughput sequencing of 16S/ITS and/or metagenomic technologies. These studies suggest that the citrus rhizosphere harbors a rich diversity of potential PGPR. Nevertheless, few PGPR have been isolated to evaluate their functional roles and underlying mechanisms in citrus, primarily due to the lack of a comprehensive citrus rhizobacterial biobank. In response to this gap, this study conducted a large-scale isolation of citrus rhizobacteria and established a rhizobacterial biobank, from which 269 potential PGPR were identified. Pot culture assays demonstrated that multiple PGPR exhibited significant growth-promoting effects on both citrus and tomato plants. This study establishes a robust rhizobacterial biobank, paving the way for further exploration and application of PGPR in citrus and other crops, thereby enhancing sustainable agricultural practices. Materials and methods Rhizosphere soil collection Rhizosphere soils from citrus trees ( Satsuma mandarin grafted onto Poncirus trifoliata rootstock) were collected from orchards across five major citrus-producing regions in China: Fujian (Citrus_FJ), Guangxi (Citrus_GX), Jiangxi (Citrus_JX), Hubei (Citrus_HB), and Shaanxi (Citrus_SX) (Fig. S 1 ). Sampling followed a standardized protocol (Xu et al. 52 ), involving the selection of 5–8 healthy citrus trees per orchard. The top 5 cm of soil was first removed, and fine roots (approximately 1 mm diameter) were collected from a depth of 5–15 cm. Roots were gently shaken to discard loosely attached soil before being placed in pre-cooled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Rhizosphere soil was extracted by ultrasonic treatment following a previously described method (Bai et al. 2 ): roots underwent sonication twice for 10 min each (15-s interval) in a sonication bath. The soil-PBS suspension, devoid of roots, was then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, with the resulting rhizosphere soil pellet divided into two parts. One half was used for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing, while the other was re-suspended in sterile PBS, mixed with an equal volume of 60% glycerol, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C for subsequent bacterial isolation. In total, 35 rhizosphere soil samples were obtained from the five citrus-growing regions (Fig. S 1 and Table S1). Rhizosphere soil DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing DNA was extracted from the collected rhizosphere soils using the Fast DNA SPIN Kit® (MP Biomedicals LLC, Solon, OH, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and concentration of extracted DNA were assessed with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer® (Thermo Scientific, USA) and by gel electrophoresis; DNA samples meeting quality standards were stored at − 80 °C for subsequent analyses. Rhizosphere soil DNA underwent 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4 region, 513F: 5'-CCAGCAGCCGCGGTAAT-3' and 783R: 5'-ACCMGGGTATCTAATCCKG-3') on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at BGI Research Institute (Shenzhen, China), adhering to the manufacturer’s instructions. Raw sequencing data were processed to remove adapter contamination and low-quality reads, resulting in clean reads. Paired-end reads with sufficient overlap were merged into tags, yielding 9,887 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from 2,328,877 sequences using the UNOISE3 algorithm implemented in USEARCH (v11.0.667_i86linux32) (Robert 12 ). Taxonomic classification of ASVs was conducted by mapping to the SILVA database (v.132) using the sintax function in USEARCH. Isolation of bacterial strains from rhizosphere soils Bacterial strains were isolated according to established protocols (Bai et al. 2 ). Each of the 35 rhizosphere soil samples was suspended and serially diluted at three concentrations (500 × , 1000 × , and 10,000 ×) using sterile PBS buffer. Bacterial strains were isolated using two methods: colony picking from agar plates and limiting dilution of soil suspensions in 96-well microtiter plates (culture medium formulation provided in Supplementary Table 6). For colony selection, 20–25 mL of agar medium was poured into Petri dishes, and diluted samples were spread on the surface; plates were incubated at 30 °C for 72 h, allowing individual colonies to develop. For limiting dilution, PBS-diluted samples were transferred in 100 µL volumes to sterile microtiter plates, sealed, and incubated at 30 °C for 72 h to enable the isolation of single microbial cells. Identification of isolated bacterial taxa was achieved through 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4 region, primers 338F: 5'-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3' and 806R: 5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3') with two-step barcoded PCR (Bai et al. 2 ) and sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq-PE250 platform (Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), as per previously described methods (Niu et al. 34 ). Screening of potential PGPR The screening procedures for potential PGPR are illustrated in Fig. 3 A. Phosphate dissolution: The ability of bacterial strains to solubilize Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 and phytin (used as phosphorus sources) was assessed by observing clear halos around colonies on Pikovskaya agar plates (Pikovskaya 40 ). IAA production: Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production was quantified using the Salkowski method, following a previously described method (Wang et al. 50 ). Bacterial strains were cultured in liquid LB medium at 28 °C for four days, after which the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant collected. One mL of supernatant was mixed with two mL of Salkowski's reagent (2% FeCl 3 in 35% HClO 4 solution) and left in the dark for 30 min. A pink color indicated IAA production. Siderophore production: Siderophore production was detected using the Chrome Azurol S (CAS) agar method (Liu et al. 31 ). A 10 μL aliquot of bacterial culture was inoculated onto CAS agar plates and incubated at 28 °C for 3–5 days. A yellow-orange halo surrounding the inoculation site signified siderophore production. Root development: The impact of bacterial strains on root development was tested through co-cultivation with Arabidopsis seedlings. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 2% NaOCl for 15 min, rinsed five times with sterile water, and then transferred to Petri dishes containing 1/2 MS medium. The plates, covered with foil and stored upside down (agar up), were stored at 4 °C for two days, then incubated at 28 °C with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod for seven days to develop seedlings. Bacterial inoculation was performed at a site 3 cm away from the root tip. The plates were then positioned vertically in a growth chamber (5 plants per plate). After two weeks, root length and the number of lateral roots in Arabidopsis were measured. Bacterial inoculation in pot-culture and measurement of plant growth Citrus ( Fortunella hindsii ) and tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum , ‘Micro-tom’) seedlings were cultivated in pots containing a compound substrate (peat soil: vermiculite = 1:1) in a greenhouse. Citrus seeds were surface-sterilized with 2% NaOCl, sown in autoclaved vermiculite pots, and grown in a growth chamber at 28 °C with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod for one month to obtain seedlings. The bacterial strains were then inoculated into the citrus rhizosphere during transplanting. Tomato seeds were surface-sterilized with 2% NaOCl for 15 min, transferred to agar plates, covered with foil, and vernalized at 4 °C for 2 days with the plates inverted. After vernalization, the plates were incubated at 28 °C with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod for 7 days to obtain seedlings. Bacterial strains were subsequently inoculated into the tomato rhizosphere during transplanting. For bacterial inoculation, citrus seedlings were grown in a greenhouse, while tomato seedlings were cultured in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Bacterial strains were first cultured on LB agar plates at 28 °C for 3 days in a biochemical incubator, followed by resuspension in liquid LB medium for 12 h in a shaker at 28 °C and 180 rpm/min. A 5 mL bacterial suspension (OD 600 = 0.2, log 10 CFU/mL ≈ 8) was inoculated into the rhizosphere of citrus and tomato plants at two time points: immediately upon transplanting (0 days) and 7 days post-transplanting, to ensure successful bacterial colonization. Tomato plant height was measured 4 weeks after pot culture, and citrus plant height was recorded at 8 weeks. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS 29.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation, with no fewer than six biological replicates per experiment. Significant differences between groups were assessed using Student’s t -test for pairwise comparisons and Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons against the control group. A p -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Characteristics of citrus rhizosphere microbiome To investigate the citrus microbiome composition, rhizosphere soil samples were collected from citrus plants in five major citrus-producing regions of China (Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, and Shaanxi provinces) (Fig. S 1 ). High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to characterize the rhizosphere microbial communities. After data filtering, a total of 2,328,877 high-quality sequences were obtained, with 977,222 valid sequences generating 9,887 ASVs (Table S2). These 9,887 ASVs were taxonomically assigned to 28 bacterial phyla (Table S 3 ), with Proteobacteria being the most abundant, representing 55.53% of the sequences. Other predominant phyla included Actinobacteria (16.33%), Acidobacteria (9.78%), Bacteroidetes (5.02%), and Chloroflexi (4.67%) (Fig. 1 a). The relative abundance of these five bacterial phyla was consistently observed across the rhizospheres of citrus plants from the five citrus-producing regions (Fig. 1 b). These 9,887 ASVs were further classified into 362 bacterial genera (Table S4), with Pseudomonas (8.15%), Cupriavidus (5.75%), Burkholderia (4.50%), Candidatus (3.94%), and Sphingomonas (3.71%) being the five most abundant genera. Fig. 1 Rhizobacterial distribution at the phylum level across five citrus-producing regions. a Percentage representation of the top 10 rhizobacterial phyla. b Phylum-level distribution of rhizobacteria across five citrus-producing regions in China: Citrus_FJ (Fujian), Citrus_GX (Guangxi), Citrus_JX (Jiangxi), Citrus_HB (Hubei), and Citrus_SX (Shaanxi) Proteobacteria is a dominant bacterial phylum in citrus rhizosphere A notable feature of the taxonomic composition in the rhizosphere of citrus plants from five major citrus-producing regions of China was the high relative abundance of Proteobacteria, ranging from 32.39% to 55.59% (Fig. 1 b). To investigate whether the high relative abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum is a common feature across the plant kingdom, rhizosphere microbiome data from 16 plant species were analyzed, including 7 perennial woody plants—citrus (integrating data from this study and Xu et al. 52 ), apple (Abdelfattah et al. 1 ), blueberry (Zhang et al. 56 , 57 ), bayberry (Ren et al. 41 ), grapevine (Dries et al. 10 ), poplar (Zhu et al. 61 ), and willow (Yergeau et al. 54 )—and 9 annual herbaceous plants— Arabidopsis (Bulgarelli et al. 5 ), rice (Edwards et al. 13 ), foxtail millet (Jin et al. 24 ), maize (Walters et al. 47 ), potato (Hou et al. 19 ), tomato (Cheng et al. 8 ), cucumber (Wang et al. 49 ), sugar beet (Huang et al. 20 ), and Nicotiana tobacco (Yan et al. 53 ). The analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum in the rhizospheres of 15 out of 16 plant species, with the exception of Arabidopsis . The other predominant phyla included Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes (Fig. 2 a). Interestingly, a significant difference in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was observed between perennial woody plants and annual herbaceous plants. Proteobacteria was more abundant in the rhizospheres of perennial woody plants (Student’s t -test: p = 0.0162), while the relative abundance of Planctomycetes (top 7, Student’s t -test: p = 0.0006) and Nitrospirae (top 10, Student’s t -test: p = 0.0300) were higher in annual herbaceous plants (Fig. 2 a). Fig. 2 Composition of rhizobacterial phyla in 16 plant species, comprising 7 perennial woody plants and 9 annual herbaceous plants. a Relative abundance of the top 15 rhizobacterial phyla across 16 plant species, based on data from this study and previous studies: citrus-global, apple, blueberry, bayberry, grapevine, poplar, willow, Arabidopsis , rice, foxtail millet, maize, potato, tomato, cucumber, sugar beet, and tobacco. Blue represents perennial woody plants; red represents annual herbaceous plants. b Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of rhizobacterial phyla from perennial woody plants and annual herbaceous plants using the unweighted UniFrac distance metric. c Comparison of the mean relative abundance of the top 10 rhizobacterial phyla between perennial woody and annual herbaceous plants. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (Student’s t -test) Additionally, a comparison of rhizosphere microbiomes between the 7 perennial woody plant species and 9 annual herbaceous plant species was conducted at the phylum level using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). The results indicated a significant difference in the composition of rhizosphere microbiomes between these two categories ( p = 0.001, R 2 = 0.23) (Fig. 2 b). A comparison of the mean relative abundance of the top 10 bacterial phyla between the two plant categories revealed that Proteobacteria (ranked as the top phylum, Student’s t -test: p = 0.0162) was significantly more abundant in the rhizosphere of perennial woody plants than in that of annual herbaceous plants. In contrast, Planctomycetes (ranked 7th, Student’s t -test: p = 0.0006) and Nitrospirae (ranked 10th, Student’s t -test: p = 0.0300) showed higher relative abundances in annual herbaceous plants (Fig. 2 c). These findings suggest that Proteobacteria is a major contributor to the observed differences in rhizosphere microbiomes between perennial woody and annual herbaceous plants. A biobank of microbes isolated from citrus rhizosphere soils is established To explore the roles of potential dominant microbes in the rhizosphere of citrus plants, microbial strains were isolated using two methods: colony picking from agar plates and limiting dilution of soil suspensions in 96-well microtiter plates (Bai et al. 2 ). A total of 3,142 isolates were obtained, from which a microbial biobank was constructed. These isolates were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing, which revealed 435 bacterial taxa (with 100% sequence similarity as the threshold). These taxa were distributed across 5 phyla, 25 orders, and 117 genera (Fig. 3 a). Among the 117 genera, the top 5 most dominant were Bacillus (17.54%), Burkholderia (11.55%), Streptomyces (7.19%), Enterobacter (5.03%), and Staphylococcus (4.74%) (Fig. 3 b). Fig. 3 Phylogenetic analysis of isolated citrus rhizobacterial strains. a Phylogenetic classification of 435 bacterial taxa from 16S rRNA sequencing, with taxa from the same phylum indicated by the same color. b Sankey diagram illustrating the distribution of the 435 bacterial taxa across domain, phylum, order, and genus levels The coverage rate of the culture-independent microbiomes by the isolated strains was assessed against 977,222 valid sequences, 9,887 ASVs, and 362 genera. Results showed that the coverage rate of isolated strains in the constructed biobank ranged from 45.95% to 71.61% against valid sequences, with specific values of 71.05% for Citrus_GX, 58.83% for Citrus_JX, 71.61% for Citrus_HB, 64.01% for Citrus_FJ, and 45.95% for Citrus_SX. Coverage against the top 100 ASVs ranged from 44 to 78%, with values of 78% for Citrus_GX, 60% for Citrus_JX, 77% for Citrus_HB, 60% for Citrus_FJ, and 44% for Citrus_SX (Fig. 4 a–e). Against the top 100 genera, coverage ranged from 27 to 53%, specifically 45% for Citrus_GX, 45% for Citrus_JX, 53% for Citrus_HB, 44% for Citrus_FJ, and 27% for Citrus_SX (Fig. 4 f).

The inner ring represents the top 100 ASVs detected in the citrus rhizosphere from each region. The outer ring with red asterisks indicates ASVs successfully aligned to isolated strains in the citrus rhizobacteria biobank. ASVs from the same phylum are shown in matching colors. Venn diagram showing rhizobacterial genera shared between culture-independent citrus rhizobacteria and those represented in the biobank from Citrus_FJ, Citrus_GX, Citrus_HB, Citrus_JX, and Citrus_SX ( f ) Based on the established microbial biobank, the roles of 435 bacterial taxa were evaluated by assessing their IAA production, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, and promotion of Arabidopsis root development (Fig. 5 a). Results indicated that 47 bacterial taxa produced IAA, spanning 27 genera, with Burkholderia (14.81%), Enterobacter (11.11%), and Pseudomonas (11.11%) representing the top three. Phosphate solubilization was observed in 143 taxa across 51 genera, primarily Burkholderia (52.94%), Bacillus (25.49%), and Pseudomonas (17.65%). Siderophore production was detected in 82 taxa from 29 genera, with Burkholderia (65.52%), Bacillus (27.59%), and Enterobacter (17.24%) showing the highest occurrence. Additionally, 151 taxa from 60 genera promoted Arabidopsis root development, with Bacillus (41.67%), Burkholderia (36.67%), and Pseudomonas (13.53%) being the most effective (Fig. 5 b, Table S5). In total, 269 bacterial taxa exhibited one or more growth-promoting functions, qualifying them as potential PGPR: 155 taxa exhibited a single function, 67 demonstrated two, 39 showed three, and 8 exhibited all four functions (Fig. 5 b, Table S5). Taxonomic annotation revealed that most of the 269 potential PGPR were affiliated with the phyla Proteobacteria (41.63%), Firmicutes (33.48%), Actinomycota (21.72%), and Bacteroidetes (3.17%); the orders Bacillales (33.33%), Mycobacteriales (15.77%), and Burkholderiales (10.36%); and the genera Bacillus (16.43%), Nocardia (9.86%), and Burkholderia (8.45%) (Table S5). Notably, 69.57% of strains exhibiting three or four functions belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria (Fig. 5 b, Table S5), indicating its prominence among potential PGPR in citrus.

This figure is based on the standard map with the censor code: GS (2016) 2962. d Proportion of potential PGPR with varying growth-promoting functions across different habitats. Each circle denotes a rhizobacterial strain; the x-axis shows the number of tested functions, while the y-axis represents the percentage of strains in citrus habitats Given the consistent rhizosphere microbiome composition across citrus habitats (Fig. 1 b), the distribution of potential PGPR was examined across 28 citrus habitats, including the five regions from this study and 23 habitats from a global citrus microbiome dataset (Xu et al. 52 ), using a 98% sequence similarity threshold (Fig. 5 c). The analysis showed that bacterial strains with no, one, two, three, and four growth-promoting functions occupied 35.23%, 52.27%, 47.38%, 59.89%, and 65.63% of these habitats, respectively (Fig. 5 d). These findings suggest that bacterial strains with multiple growth-promoting functions generally exhibit broader distribution across citrus habitats. Functional validation of the potential PGPR by pot-culture experiment To evaluate the functions of potential PGPR, pot culture experiments were conducted using Fortunella hindsii , a wild citrus variety with a short juvenile phase (Zhu et al. 60 ), and Solanum lycopersicum ‘Micro-tom’. Plant height and dry weight were measured in strain-inoculated plants and compared to control plants without inoculation. Given that bacterial strains exhibiting three or four tested functions were represented by 14 genera (Table S5), 22 representative strains covering these genera were selected for the pot culture experiments. Results indicated that among these 22 strains, 11 (belonging to 9 genera: 3D1, 3L5, 30D3, 2H3, 3K4, 30E7, 2G1, 2L2, 3D4, 3F7, and 14B3) significantly promoted citrus growth, as supported by plant height and dry weight data (Fig. 6 a–c), while 6 strains (belonging to 4 genera: 30D3, 1F1, 2H2, 2H3, 3K4, and 2L2) significantly enhanced tomato growth (Fig. S2a–c). Additionally, two strains (10E8 and 14E1) were observed to significantly inhibit tomato growth (Fig. S2a–c).

Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation from 8–12 independent biological replicates. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (Dunnett's test). The 22 representative PGPR strains tested were 3C6, 3D1, 3K7, 3L5, 10E8, 30D3, 1D3, 1F1, 2A1, 2H2, 2H3, 3K1, 2D7, 3K4, 14E1, 30E7, 2G1, 2L2, 3A5, 3D4, 3F7, and 14B3 Discussion Plant roots attract microorganisms to the rhizosphere by releasing a range of photosynthetic products, including sugars, amino acids, organic acids, polymer carbohydrates, and lipids (Ling et al. 30 ). This similarity in the composition of photosynthetic exudates often drives convergence in rhizosphere microbiotas (Perez-Jaramillo et al. 37 ; Jiang et al. 22 ; Wang et al. 48 ). Consistently, our analysis of 16 plant species revealed similar rhizosphere microbiota compositions, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes as the dominant phyla (Fig. 2 a). However, perennial woody plants displayed significantly greater enrichment of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere compared to annual herbaceous plants (Fig. 2 a, c). PCoA further underscored substantial differences in rhizosphere bacterial phyla composition between perennial and annual species (Fig. 2 b), likely attributable to the higher root density and increased organic carbon release by perennial woody plants (Ginnan et al. 17 ). Our findings showed that 69.57% of tested citrus rhizosphere strains with three or four growth-promoting functions belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum (Fig. 5 b, Table S5), suggesting a critical role for Proteobacteria in supporting citrus growth. The pronounced growth-promoting effects of Proteobacteria may be due to several factors. First, Proteobacteria has been associated with high levels of beta-glucosidase (betaG) enzyme activity, which aids in the utilization of glucose accumulated in the rhizosphere (Bertola et al. 3 ). Compared to annual herbaceous plants, perennial woody plants, with more developed root systems and higher carbohydrate accumulation, may favor the growth of such nutrient-rich microorganisms, such as the Proteobacteria bacteria (Johnston-Monje et al. 25 ; Fan et al. 15 ). Second, the Proteobacteria phylum includes numerous beneficial microorganisms, such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria like Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia (Wen et al. 51 ); disease-suppressing bacteria, including Stenotrophomonas (Liu et al. 32 ; Jiang et al. 23 ), Pseudomonas (Wen et al. 51 ), Sphingomonas (Li et al. 29 ), and Streptomyces (Lee et al. 28 ); and abiotic stress-resistant bacteria, including Streptomyces (Fitzpatrick et al. 16 ), Sphingomonas (Khan et al. 26 ), and Enterobacter (Synek et al. 44 ). Beyond the dominant Proteobacteria phylum, the citrus rhizosphere hosts a rich diversity of microbial species that are instrumental in enhancing plant growth, health, and resilience. For instance, Riera et al. ( 42 ) isolated 342 bacterial strains from the rhizosphere of healthy citrus plants and identified 6 strains potentially involved in tolerance to Huanglongbing (Riera et al. 42 ). In the current study, 3,142 bacterial strains across 117 genera were isolated from the citrus rhizosphere (Fig. 3 a, b), establishing the most extensive rhizosphere microbial biobank reported for perennial woody plants to date. Among these, 269 strains were identified as potential PGPR (Fig. 5 b, Table S5), and their distribution was assessed across 28 distinct citrus habitats. Findings revealed that bacterial strains with zero, one, two, three, and four growth-promoting functions were represented in 34.05%, 52.27%, 47.38%, 59.89%, and 65.63% of citrus habitats, respectively (Fig. 5 d). These results suggest that strains with multiple growth-promoting functions tend to have broader distributions across citrus habitats. Further analysis showed that the coverage rate of strains isolated from the five citrus-producing regions in the biobank ranged from 44 to 78% when aligned with the top 100 ASVs (78% for Citrus_GX, 77% for Citrus_HB, 60% for Citrus_JX, 60% for Citrus_FJ, and 44% for Citrus_SX) (Fig. 4 a–e). This range is comparable to previously reported coverage in Arabidopsis (54–65%) (Bai et al. 2 ). Notably, the coverage rate for Citrus_SX was the lowest (44%), significantly lower than the other regions. This discrepancy may be attributed to the significantly higher soil pH in Citrus_SX (7.809) compared to the other four citrus-producing regions (4.580–5.806) (Rousk et al. 43 ) (Table S1), or to the challenges of isolating bacterial strains from alkaline soils using standard acidic media (approximately pH 5.8) (Fitzpatrick et al. 16 ). The plant growth-promoting effects of 22 representative potential PGPR strains isolated from the citrus rhizosphere were evaluated on citrus seedlings and the model plant tomato. Results indicated that 11 of these 22 strains significantly enhanced citrus growth (Fig. 6 a–c), while a smaller subset (6/22) promoted growth in tomatoes (Fig. S2). Only four strains (30D3, 2H3, 2L2, and 3K4) demonstrated growth-promoting effects in both citrus and tomato species (Fig. 6 , Fig. S2). This dual efficacy could be attributed to their capacity to enhance plant nutrient utilization efficiency (Wang et al. 50 ) or to produce phytohormones, such as auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins (Bhattacharyya and Jha 4 ). The observed species-specific growth-promoting effects (Fig. 6 , Fig. S2) suggest that rhizosphere microbial functions may vary depending on the host plant, highlighting the importance of identifying crop-specific beneficial microbes. Notably, the citrus rhizosphere microbial biobank contains a substantial representation of Burkholderia strains (within the Proteobacteria phylum), which are absent in the rhizosphere microbial biobanks of Arabidopsis (Bai et al. 2 ) and rice (Zhang et al. 58 ). Given the recognized role of Burkholderia in enhancing plant growth, development, and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses (Pal et al. 35 ), these strains may hold particular significance for citrus cultivation, offering promising avenues for crop-specific microbial applications. Conclusions This study successfully identified 269 potential PGPR strains from the citrus rhizosphere through strain isolation and pot culture-based inoculation. Proteobacteria emerged as the predominant bacterial phylum in citrus and other perennial woody plants. The discovery of these potential PGPR strains enriches the current pool of beneficial microorganisms and offers valuable resources for developing microbial fertilizers and growth regulators to support citrus and other crop cultivation."
