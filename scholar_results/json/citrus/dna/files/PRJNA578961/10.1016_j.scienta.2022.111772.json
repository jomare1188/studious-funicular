    "full_text": "Geotrichum citri-aurantii is a postharvest fungi disease of citrus which can significantly affect the economy. In this work, two pairs of RPB1 genes primers, 2996-R&F and 4989-R&F, targeting G. citri-aurantii , were successfully developed to distinguish G. citri-aurantii from other Geotrichum species and 27 postharvest pathogens of various horticultural species. In addition, G. citri-aurantii (AY-1, isolated in 2012) used as the positive control, we further isolated 24 G. citri-aurantii isolates (4 from Wuhan, 9 from Guilin and 11 from Ganzhou) in China and investigated the median effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of all isolates to guazatine using a colony diameter approach. The results showed that the EC 50 values of 22 isolates from the three cities generally increased compared to AY-1. The isolate SF-9 from Ganzhou showed the highest EC 50 value to guazatine (EC 50 = 32.3578 mg/L) among all the isolates and the average EC 50 of isolates from Ganzhou (EC 50 = 10.3313 mg/L) was 182 times higher than that of the control. However, the average EC 50 values of the G. citri-aurantii isolates from Guilin (EC 50 = 0.0826 mg/L) and Wuhan (EC 50 = 0.1295 mg/L) were 2.2 times and 1.4 times higher than that of AY-1, respectively. What's important, 13 isolates (AY-5, G12, SF-1, 2 from Guilin city; SF-3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 16 from Ganzhou city) of all still gave rise to disease with 1 mg/L of guazatine treatment in vivo . Above all, an efficient method to afford a rapid identification of G. citri-aurantii was developed and it provided theoretical basis to control guazatine use."

          "Citrus are one of the most produced fruits in the world, thus growing in more than 100 countries ( Ismail and Zhang, 2004 ; Victoria et al., 2020 ). According to the production statistics of The United States Department of Agriculture in 2020, the global orange production was 49.4 million metric tons. However, postharvest diseases of citrus cause serious economic losses. One of the most serious fungal postharvest diseases of citrus is sour rot, which is caused by Geotrichum citri-aurantii ( Duan et al., 2016 ).",
          "It has been demonstrated that many commercially available fungicides, such as imazalil and prochloraz, do not control sour rot, although they are effective against green mold and blue mold ( Droby et al., 2002 ; Ismail and Zhang, 2004 ; Klein and Kupper, 2018 ). The demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) triazole fungicides propiconazole and cyproconazole were found to be highly effective in reducing postharvest sour rot of citrus and more efficacious than other DMIs evaluated, such as metconazole and tebuconazole ( McKay et al., 2012 ). But guazatine is the only chemical fungicide widely used in citrus-producing areas of China ( Gerez et al., 2010 ). Guazatine is a bis-guazatine fungicide with multiple active sites that was synthesized by the Nippon Soda Co. Ltd. Japan. As a broad-spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal preservative, guazatine could inhibit spore germination as well as the elongation of the germ tube and the formation of adherent cells and hyphae ( Zhou et al., 2016 ). To the best of our knowledge, guazatine has been registered to combat leaf spots caused by various pathogens on some horticultural and field crops in Japan, Korea, Philippines, and some Middle Eastern countries, but has not been registered in Europe or NA ( Dreassi et al., 2007 ). Along with this, it has also been registered to control sour rot in citrus post-harvest in China ( http://www.icama.org.cn/hysj/index.jhtml ).",
          "Additionally, the use of chemical fungicides has become increasingly restricted due to the increased resistance of fungal pathogens to fungicides. The guazatine instructions reported that fruit growers should soak citrus with 0.2 mg/L guazatine before bagging fruits. However, the survey showed that the concentration of using guazatine was reached to 0.4–0.6 mg/L in Ganzhou according to the fruit growers said. Therefore, we suspected that the widespread use of guazatine may have caused the proliferation of resistant isolates of G. citri-aurantii , reducing the effectiveness of this fungicide. Since there are few options available for controlling G. citri-aurantii , this problem requires serious attention to solve it.",
          "To date, the next big issue is the identification of G. citri-aurantii in citrus. It is intuitively investigated by determining its macro- and microscopic features such as colony morphology, size and shape of conidia, and infection symptoms ( Diguta et al., 2011 ). However, morphological identification is not reliable due to the overlapping morphological features between the closely related taxa of Geotrichum spp. ( McKay et al., 2012 ) and the instability of fungal morphology, which is significantly influenced by environmental factors and the culture media ( Rubila et al., 2008 ). Fortunately, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers (ITS1 and ITS4) together with the sequence analysis have greatly improved the accuracy of fungal identification ( Nakamura et al., 2008 ; Schoch et al., 2012 ; Abass, 2017 ), but some limitations were still existed. For instance, ITS primers were not suitable for identifying G. citri-aurantii due to high sequence homology among different Geotrichum species ( Kaouther et al., 2007 ). So far, the genome sequence of G. candidum, G. fermentans and G. citri-aurantii have been published, we try to identify the G. citri-aurantii according to conservative gene of RPB1 genes, which exhibited high stability and accuracy ( Islam et al., 2012 ; Kepler et al., 2014 ). Thus, this method may be a new technology for G. citri-aurantii identification.",
          "In summary, there are key questions to be addressed. Has the sensitivity to guazatine of G. citri-aurantii isolates in this area decreased because of the frequent use of guazatine in China? And how can we identify G. citri-aurantii faster and easier? To solve these problems, the present study aimed to investigate the median effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of isolates to guazatine during postharvest storage in three major citrus-producing areas of China. The specific RPB1 molecular marker of G. citri-aurantii genome was developed for the identification of G. citri-aurantii . The work of the manuscript is important and the results provides a basis for G. citri-aurantii identification. Meanwhile, the increased resistance of G. citri-aurantii to guazatine reminds us that control the concentration of guazatine used and find more reasonable method to inhibit sour rot occurrence."

It was rinsed three times with sterile water, plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 28 °C for 3–5 d The mycelium of the single colony edge was picked up by the inoculating loop, and a new PDA plate was streaked and cultured at 28 °C. The above procedure was repeated and multiple purifications were performed to obtain a single spore culture.",
          "G. citri-aurantii (AY-1) was isolated in 2012 and stored previously in our laboratory. The two isolates (W2, W3) were isolated from the surface of decaying citrus fruit in Huazhong Agricultural University citrus orchard in Wuhan city in 2021. The six isolates (G6, G7, G9, G10, G12, G13) and seventeen isolates (AY-1, AY-2, AY-5, JY-1, SF-1∼SF-9, SF-13∼SF-16) were also isolated from Guangxi Academy of Specialty Crops in Guilin city and Ganzhou Institute of Citrus Science in Ganzhou city respectively ( Table 3 ) in 2021. The infected citrus fruit from Guilin and Ganzhou were soaked with 0.2 mg/L guazatine for 30 s postharvest and they were stored for 2–3 months in room temperature storehouses (packinghouse staff told us).",
          "In addition, 27 postharvest pathogens ( Table 1 , 2-28) from different horticultural products (citrus, tomato, banana, mango, apple, among other crops) were collected as described above and were identified by ITS primers. Finally, we confirmed the potential pathogen by means of Koch postulates. Therefore, these isolates were used subsequently to test the specificity of the two molecular markers."

Then, the in vitro antifungal activities were tested against G. citri-aurantii using the mycelia growth inhibition method. Guazatine was dissolved in acetone to prepare the 2 g/L stock solution before mixing it with molten PDA below 50 °C, adding the same volume acetone used as negative control. The initial concentration used for antifungal activity screening was set at 2 mg/L ( Xiao et al., 2013 ). The percentage inhibition (%) was calculated as (B-A) / (B-5) × 100% (A being the mycelial diameter (mm) in Petri dishes with guazatine and B being the diameter (mm) of the negative control and 5 being the diameter (mm) of the fungi blocks made by a cork borer). Acetone by itself served as the negative control. Each measurement consisted of three 90 mm petri dishes. We used the logarithm of the concentration of 10 as the abscissa and the probability value corresponding to the inhibition rate as the ordinate to find the regression equation and the correlation coefficient R 2 for each test concentration. The EC 50 value and its 95% confidence interval were calculated based on the probability value corresponding to 50% inhibition ( Jiang and Kopp-Schneider, 2014 ; Jurick et al., 2019 )."

In addition, the amplicons were sequenced for comparison with the prospective products of the corresponding genes. The sequences of the obtained PCR products of AY-1 showed high identity (>99%) with the sequences of Gci002996 gene and Gci004989 gene. Therefore, the two primers were specific enough to distinguish G. citri-aurantii from other Geotrichum spp. and the postharvest pathogens of different horticultural products.

          "In recent years, citrus sour rot causing economic losses was more and more serious and seriously affect the healthy progress of the citrus industry ( Soto-Muoz et al., 2020 ), but a rapid identification method of G. citri-aurantii has not been reported. Comparison of RPB1 conserved genes in the same genera will be a more accepted molecular identification technology by rapidly sequencing technologies, which exhibited high stability and accuracy ( Islam et al., 2012 ; Kepler et al., 2014 ). Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel molecular technique to rapidly identify G. citri-aurantii using a conserved fungal gene ( RPB1 ) ( Houbraken et al., 2012 ; Chen et al., 2017 ). And the specific primers were designed based on the sequences of the homologous regions in G. citri-aurantii, G. candidum and G. fermentans genomes ( Jarman et al., 2004 ). So far, only these three Geotrichum species genomes have been published. Taking into account that the published genus Geotrichum genomes were so few, we explored the use of Gci004989 primers. From the results, there required the need to sequence the PCR products, making the results more accurate. In this case, there was a small amount of amplification from other organisms which was overcome by using both primer sets. Therefore, we suggest that the use the two pairs of primers at the same time is the best method for the accurate identification of G. citri-aurantii .",
          "In addition, fungicide resistance monitoring and characterization is generally conducted by means of in vitro growth studies ( Russell, 2004 ). In our study, the EC 50 values to guazatine of 22 G. citri-aurantii strains had increased when compared with that of the AY-1 strain. Eight of thirteen isolates from Ganzhou City caused sour rot in citrus with the 1 mg/L guazatine treatment, it was suggested that resistance to guazatine widely exists in G. citri-aurantii from Ganzhou. The remaining isolates from Wuhan and Guilin seemed to demonstrate a shift in sensitivity. Guazatine was introduced in the 1970s for the control of G. citri-aurantii and used intensively over the last 30 years. So it is possible to induce resistance in G. citri-aurantii strains ( Dreassi et al., 2007 ) by using high concentrations of guazatine for a long time ( Raposo et al., 1996 ). To monitor the resistance of strains, more isolates from main citrus producing areas (such as Ganzhou, Guilin and Wuhan) in China should be collected to determine the possible reasons of reduced sensitivity to guazatine. In our study, the highest EC 50 value of all G.citri-aurantii isolates was up to 32.3578 mg/L, which was 568 times higher than that of AY-1. If isolates with this level of resistance prevail in an environment where fruit are stored in a long term protocol and repacked; failure of control can be expected ( Erasmus et al., 2015 ). Therefore, our laboratory will continuously test G. citri-aurantii EC 50 values to guazatine in citrus producing areas. Meanwhile, one should carefully control guazatine dosage, or use other method instead for the foreseeable future.",
          "The higher EC 50 value strains can cause decayed fruit with a generally used concentration of the guazatine treatment. Growth of sensitive strains were inhibited after high concentration guazatine treatment, leading to the resistance strains becoming more and more prevalent. This in turn could lead to high amounts of sour rot on citrus. Meanwhile, the above results remind us that the identification of commercially viable, effective, and alternative control methods have become an important challenge. On the other hand, to prevent sour rot of citrus from emerging during fruit storage, the resistance to guazatine needs to be monitored.",
          "The study showed that the average EC 50 value of the Ganzhou strains (10.3313 mg/L) was 125 times and 80 times higher than that of Guilin and Wuhan strains, respectively. These results indicated that there is a large difference in the resistance of the G. citri-aurantii isolates in different citrus production areas with a reference to wild-type strain. This may be related to the amount of guazatine used during storage. Ganzhou was one of the most important citrus production areas in China. The result may implies that the resistance G.citri-aurantii strains was increased in the case of the use of high concentration guazatine every year in Ganzhou. Our data suggests that guazatine use needs to be controlled. Firstly, fungicide guidance must be carried out based on actual guazatine resistance detected in different citrus producing areas. Secondly, a more effective and safer alternative needs to be developed to inhibit infection by citrus sour rot as soon as possible. For example ( Soto-Muoz et al., 2020 ), it is feasible project to look at using that a small amount guazatine mixed with GRAS salt are used to soak citrus postharvest.",
          "In summary, this work showed the importance of controlling high concentration guazatine use in citrus production areas. Meanwhile, it was said that further increasing some fungicides residue levels will not be effective in improving control of resistance isolates, such as imazalil treatment Penicillium digitatum ( Erasmus et al., 2015 ). At the same time, the sporulation inhibition effect of IMZ is better expressed when it is applied in wax coatings than when applied in an aqueous solution ( Erasmus et al., 2013 ; Njombolwana et al., 2013 ). Therefore, we try to search for other environmentally friendly fungicides to control citrus sour rot on the one hand; and on the other, fungicides with alternative modes of action could be applied to reach the ideal effect."

According to the production statistics of The United States Department of Agriculture in 2020, the global orange production was 49.4 million metric tons. However, postharvest diseases of citrus cause serious economic losses. One of the most serious fungal postharvest diseases of citrus is sour rot, which is caused by Geotrichum citri-aurantii ( Duan et al., 2016 ). It has been demonstrated that many commercially available fungicides, such as imazalil and prochloraz, do not control sour rot, although they are effective against green mold and blue mold ( Droby et al., 2002 ; Ismail and Zhang, 2004 ; Klein and Kupper, 2018 ). The demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) triazole fungicides propiconazole and cyproconazole were found to be highly effective in reducing postharvest sour rot of citrus and more efficacious than other DMIs evaluated, such as metconazole and tebuconazole ( McKay et al., 2012 ). But guazatine is the only chemical fungicide widely used in citrus-producing areas of China ( Gerez et al., 2010 ). Guazatine is a bis-guazatine fungicide with multiple active sites that was synthesized by the Nippon Soda Co. Ltd. Japan. As a broad-spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal preservative, guazatine could inhibit spore germination as well as the elongation of the germ tube and the formation of adherent cells and hyphae ( Zhou et al., 2016 ). To the best of our knowledge, guazatine has been registered to combat leaf spots caused by various pathogens on some horticultural and field crops in Japan, Korea, Philippines, and some Middle Eastern countries, but has not been registered in Europe or NA ( Dreassi et al., 2007 ). Along with this, it has also been registered to control sour rot in citrus post-harvest in China ( http://www.icama.org.cn/hysj/index.jhtml ). Additionally, the use of chemical fungicides has become increasingly restricted due to the increased resistance of fungal pathogens to fungicides. The guazatine instructions reported that fruit growers should soak citrus with 0.2 mg/L guazatine before bagging fruits. However, the survey showed that the concentration of using guazatine was reached to 0.4–0.6 mg/L in Ganzhou according to the fruit growers said. Therefore, we suspected that the widespread use of guazatine may have caused the proliferation of resistant isolates of G. citri-aurantii , reducing the effectiveness of this fungicide. Since there are few options available for controlling G. citri-aurantii , this problem requires serious attention to solve it. To date, the next big issue is the identification of G. citri-aurantii in citrus. It is intuitively investigated by determining its macro- and microscopic features such as colony morphology, size and shape of conidia, and infection symptoms ( Diguta et al., 2011 ). However, morphological identification is not reliable due to the overlapping morphological features between the closely related taxa of Geotrichum spp. ( McKay et al., 2012 ) and the instability of fungal morphology, which is significantly influenced by environmental factors and the culture media ( Rubila et al., 2008 ). Fortunately, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers (ITS1 and ITS4) together with the sequence analysis have greatly improved the accuracy of fungal identification ( Nakamura et al., 2008 ; Schoch et al., 2012 ; Abass, 2017 ), but some limitations were still existed. For instance, ITS primers were not suitable for identifying G. citri-aurantii due to high sequence homology among different Geotrichum species ( Kaouther et al., 2007 ). So far, the genome sequence of G. candidum, G. fermentans and G. citri-aurantii have been published, we try to identify the G. citri-aurantii according to conservative gene of RPB1 genes, which exhibited high stability and accuracy ( Islam et al., 2012 ; Kepler et al., 2014 ). Thus, this method may be a new technology for G. citri-aurantii identification. In summary, there are key questions to be addressed. Has the sensitivity to guazatine of G. citri-aurantii isolates in this area decreased because of the frequent use of guazatine in China? And how can we identify G. citri-aurantii faster and easier? To solve these problems, the present study aimed to investigate the median effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of isolates to guazatine during postharvest storage in three major citrus-producing areas of China. The specific RPB1 molecular marker of G. citri-aurantii genome was developed for the identification of G. citri-aurantii . The work of the manuscript is important and the results provides a basis for G. citri-aurantii identification. Meanwhile, the increased resistance of G. citri-aurantii to guazatine reminds us that control the concentration of guazatine used and find more reasonable method to inhibit sour rot occurrence. 2 Materials and methods All isolates were isolated and purified in our laboratory. Pericarp tissue was cut (5 mm × 5 mm) at the junction of the disease and the healthy tissue. It was rinsed three times with sterile water, plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 28 °C for 3–5 d The mycelium of the single colony edge was picked up by the inoculating loop, and a new PDA plate was streaked and cultured at 28 °C. The above procedure was repeated and multiple purifications were performed to obtain a single spore culture. G. citri-aurantii (AY-1) was isolated in 2012 and stored previously in our laboratory. The two isolates (W2, W3) were isolated from the surface of decaying citrus fruit in Huazhong Agricultural University citrus orchard in Wuhan city in 2021. The six isolates (G6, G7, G9, G10, G12, G13) and seventeen isolates (AY-1, AY-2, AY-5, JY-1, SF-1∼SF-9, SF-13∼SF-16) were also isolated from Guangxi Academy of Specialty Crops in Guilin city and Ganzhou Institute of Citrus Science in Ganzhou city respectively ( Table 3 ) in 2021. The infected citrus fruit from Guilin and Ganzhou were soaked with 0.2 mg/L guazatine for 30 s postharvest and they were stored for 2–3 months in room temperature storehouses (packinghouse staff told us). In addition, 27 postharvest pathogens ( Table 1 , 2-28) from different horticultural products (citrus, tomato, banana, mango, apple, among other crops) were collected as described above and were identified by ITS primers. Finally, we confirmed the potential pathogen by means of Koch postulates. Therefore, these isolates were used subsequently to test the specificity of the two molecular markers. 2.1 Development of specific molecular markers targeting G. citri-aurantii The genome sequences of G. citri-aurantii (AY-1) (PRJNA578961), G. candidum (PRJNA587010) and G. fermentans (PRJNA287202) were downloaded from the NCBI database, which were used to develop the G. citri-aurantii specific RPB1 gene primers (2996-R&F and 4989-R&F). Six Geotrichum spp. isolates of G. penicillatum (AY 95,002), Geotrichum sp. (AF 2,012,006), G. ludwigii (AY 93,035), G. suaveolens (AY 93,036), G. candidum Link & person (AY 93,040) and G. candidum (AY 93,042) ( Table 1 ), were purchased from the China Center for Type Culture Collection. The RPB1 gene sequences (Supplementary Table 1) from G. citri-aurantii (Gci002996 and Gci004989) ( Zhao et al., 2020 ) , G. candidum (BN980_GECA15s00890g and BN980_GECA15s00901g) and G. fermentans (LFTX01002520.1 and LFTX01003583.1) were searched and downloaded from the NCBI website ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). The RPB1 gene sequences of G. citri-aurantii were subjected to BLAST analysis against the G. candidum RPB1 gene sequences and the G. fermentans RPB1 gene sequences respectively. The homologous regions were revealed after the alignments. The mutational sites in homologous regions were chosen in the homologous regions as positions for the primer pairs. Then, the primer pair 2996-R&F was designed with the Premier 5 tool ( Wallinger et al., 2012 ; Chuang et al., 2013 ). Firstly, 25 G. citri-aurantii isolates and 27 postharvest pathogens were cultured in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 28 ℃ for 4 d Mycelia and spores were collected and ground into powder in liquid nitrogen for DNA extraction. The genomic DNA of all pathogens were extracted by using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method ( Chin et al., 2013 ). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific amplification was performed using 2× Es Taq MasterMix from Beijing ComWin Biotech Co. Ltd., and the reaction system and reaction conditions were set according to the protocol. The PCR reactions contained 1 μL DNA template, 1 μL 10 μM of each primer, 9.5 μL ddH 2 O and 12.5 μL 2× Es Taq MasterMix (CWbiotech, China) in a total volume of 25 μL. The PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 45 s and a final elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. We investigated whether the size of the isolates sequence was the same as AY-1 by gel electrophoresis method and then we extracted the amplified bands from all isolates and sequenced them. The molecular markers were inapplicable to identify G. citri-aurantii if the size and the sequences from other isolates were same as that of AY-1. 2.2 Investigation of the EC 50 values of the 25 isolates of G. citri-aurantii to guazatine Firstly, the 25 isolates were isolated and purified from citrus fruit with natural decay (from Ganzhou, Guilin and Wuhan City in China). Then, the in vitro antifungal activities were tested against G. citri-aurantii using the mycelia growth inhibition method. Guazatine was dissolved in acetone to prepare the 2 g/L stock solution before mixing it with molten PDA below 50 °C, adding the same volume acetone used as negative control. The initial concentration used for antifungal activity screening was set at 2 mg/L ( Xiao et al., 2013 ). The percentage inhibition (%) was calculated as (B-A) / (B-5) × 100% (A being the mycelial diameter (mm) in Petri dishes with guazatine and B being the diameter (mm) of the negative control and 5 being the diameter (mm) of the fungi blocks made by a cork borer). Acetone by itself served as the negative control. Each measurement consisted of three 90 mm petri dishes. We used the logarithm of the concentration of 10 as the abscissa and the probability value corresponding to the inhibition rate as the ordinate to find the regression equation and the correlation coefficient R 2 for each test concentration. The EC 50 value and its 95% confidence interval were calculated based on the probability value corresponding to 50% inhibition ( Jiang and Kopp-Schneider, 2014 ; Jurick et al., 2019 ). 2.3 Resistance screening of the 25 wild type isolates of G. citri-aurantii to guazatine in vivo For the in vivo experiment, 72 citrus fruit ( Citrus unshiu cv. Guoqing No. 1, HZAU), which were the same size and without mechanical damage, were rinsed with clean water and were soaked in 2% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min. They were all rinsed twice with distilled water. Each citrus fruit was stabbed to generate three wounds around the equator. All purified G. citri-aurantii isolates were held in a −80 ℃ refrigerator freezer and were activated on PDA at 28 ℃ for 3 d These spores from these isolates were isolated and purified for 3–4 times according to picking a single colony. Then purified lawn was cultured on PDA medium at 28℃ for 3d Finally, the fresh spores from the edge of the colony were diluted to 1.0 × 10 6 CFU/mL with sterile water. A 20 μL spore suspension at 1.0 × 10 6 CFU/mL of each strain was inoculated in one wound on the citrus fruit as positive control group. The second wound was inoculated with 20 μL sterile water as negative control group. The third wound was inoculated with 20 μL spore suspension at 1.0 × 10 6 CFU/mL and 1 mg/L (fruit farmers told us) of guazatine mixture. The treated fruit wounds were observed after 7 d Each experiment employed three fruits and the experiment was replicated three times. 2.4 Statistical analysis All experiments were conducted for three times, then the experiments were performed with a completely randomized design. The data of the three repeats were analyzed by SPSS 26. 0 statistical software. The significant differences were calculated with one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan's Multiple Range test ( p < 0.05). 3 Results 3.1 Design and validation of specific molecular markers The primers 2996-R&F and 4989-R&F ( Table 2 were designed with primer 5 at the appropriate positions after the BLAST alignment of the RPB1 genes Gci002996 and Gci004989 (Supplemental Table S1) with the genomes of the fungi G. candidum and G. fermentans (Supplemental Fig. S1). We performed the PCR amplification of 6 Geotrichum spp., 24 G. citri-aurantii isolates and 27 postharvest pathogens with the primers 2996-R&F and 4989-R&F. Both pairs of primers showed G. citri-aurantii specificity and the expected DNA bands or amplification signals were obtained in the PCR ( Figs. 1 A, 1 B, 2 A and 2 B). The size of the amplification band for 6 Geotrichum spp. and 24 G. citri-aurantii isolates was same as that of AY-1, but there was not the same size band in the PCR of the 27 postharvest pathogens ( Figs. 1 C and 2 C). In addition, the amplicons were sequenced for comparison with the prospective products of the corresponding genes. The sequences of the obtained PCR products of AY-1 showed high identity (>99%) with the sequences of Gci002996 gene and Gci004989 gene. Therefore, the two primers were specific enough to distinguish G. citri-aurantii from other Geotrichum spp. and the postharvest pathogens of different horticultural products. The primer 2996-R&F and 4989-R&F may be considered as a candidate marker of G. citri-aurantii . Previously, we identified G. citri-aurantii by using morphological features combined with use of ITS primers. Two pairs of the primers were specific for the amplification of the corresponding genes in G. citri-aurantii . 3.2 Analysis of the EC 50 values of the 25 G. citri-aurantii wild type isolates to guazatine G. citri-aurantii (AY-1) was isolated and stored in our laboratory in 2012. The EC 50 values of it was 0.0569 mg/L ( Table 3 ) and it was used to compare with other 15 isolates from Ganzhou City. The results showed that guazatine could effectively inhibit the growth of G. citri-aurantii and that the hyphae harely grew at a concentration of 0.135 mg/L. The sensitivity to guazatine of G. citri-aurantii isolates W2 and W3, from Wuhan city, was reduced. The EC 50 values of 0.1156 mg/L and 0.1433 mg/L, respectively, were nearly twice that of the sensitive control AY-1. To explore the antifungal activity of guazatine, 6 G. citri-aurantii strains from Guilin city and 16 G. citri-aurantii strains from five postharvest citrus storages in Ganzhou city were examined further. The results revealed that G6, G7, and G9 from Guilin City all developed higher EC 50 values to guazatine than the positive control ( Table 3 ). The EC 50 value of G6 was the highest of the four strains from Guilin, which was 0.1272 mg/L. Average EC 50 values of three cities strains were calculated, the isolates from Ganzhou city displayed the highest average EC 50 value (average EC 50 = 10.3313 mg/L), which was 182 times higher than that of positive control and 125 times higher than that of Guilin G. citri-aurantii (0.0826 mg/L) ( Table 3 ). It was worth noting that the G. citri-aurantii strain of SF-9 from Ganzhou city showed the highest EC 50 value to guazatine (32.3578 mg/L) of all the Ganzhou strains. In addition, the EC 50 values of half of the strains were greater than 10 mg/L, while the EC 50 values of the other half was less than 10 mg/L ( Table 3 ). 3.3 Analysis of the sensitivity of the 25 wild type isolates to guazatine in vivo According to the EC 50 values of all 25 isolates, 33% of the EC 50 values were larger than the sensitive control AY-1. When citrus is infected, the reduced sensitivity to guazatine is a principal concern. The results showed that the AY-1 could not cause citrus disease with the 1 mg/L guazatine treatment. Similarly, it was found that the EC 50 values of 11 strains (W2, W3, G6, G7, G9, G10, G13, AY-2, JY-1, SF-8 and SF-14) had not shifted substantially and citrus infected by the strains with similar EC 50 values did not show symptoms. However, the 13 strains (AY-5, G12, SF-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 16) still gave rise to disease with the 1 mg/L guazatine treatment ( Fig. 3 ). The EC 50 values of these strains was shown to be greatly increased ( Table 3 ) and this assay showed that this increase was biologically relevant. One isolate did not follow the pattern mentioned above. The EC 50 value of AY-5 was 0.1272 mg/L and was 2 times higher than that of the positive control, but symptoms still formed after guazatine treatment. 4 Discussion In recent years, citrus sour rot causing economic losses was more and more serious and seriously affect the healthy progress of the citrus industry ( Soto-Muoz et al., 2020 ), but a rapid identification method of G. citri-aurantii has not been reported. Comparison of RPB1 conserved genes in the same genera will be a more accepted molecular identification technology by rapidly sequencing technologies, which exhibited high stability and accuracy ( Islam et al., 2012 ; Kepler et al., 2014 ). Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel molecular technique to rapidly identify G. citri-aurantii using a conserved fungal gene ( RPB1 ) ( Houbraken et al., 2012 ; Chen et al., 2017 ). And the specific primers were designed based on the sequences of the homologous regions in G. citri-aurantii, G. candidum and G. fermentans genomes ( Jarman et al., 2004 ). So far, only these three Geotrichum species genomes have been published. Taking into account that the published genus Geotrichum genomes were so few, we explored the use of Gci004989 primers. From the results, there required the need to sequence the PCR products, making the results more accurate. In this case, there was a small amount of amplification from other organisms which was overcome by using both primer sets. Therefore, we suggest that the use the two pairs of primers at the same time is the best method for the accurate identification of G. citri-aurantii . In addition, fungicide resistance monitoring and characterization is generally conducted by means of in vitro growth studies ( Russell, 2004 ). In our study, the EC 50 values to guazatine of 22 G. citri-aurantii strains had increased when compared with that of the AY-1 strain. Eight of thirteen isolates from Ganzhou City caused sour rot in citrus with the 1 mg/L guazatine treatment, it was suggested that resistance to guazatine widely exists in G. citri-aurantii from Ganzhou. The remaining isolates from Wuhan and Guilin seemed to demonstrate a shift in sensitivity. Guazatine was introduced in the 1970s for the control of G. citri-aurantii and used intensively over the last 30 years. So it is possible to induce resistance in G. citri-aurantii strains ( Dreassi et al., 2007 ) by using high concentrations of guazatine for a long time ( Raposo et al., 1996 ). To monitor the resistance of strains, more isolates from main citrus producing areas (such as Ganzhou, Guilin and Wuhan) in China should be collected to determine the possible reasons of reduced sensitivity to guazatine. In our study, the highest EC 50 value of all G.citri-aurantii isolates was up to 32.3578 mg/L, which was 568 times higher than that of AY-1. If isolates with this level of resistance prevail in an environment where fruit are stored in a long term protocol and repacked; failure of control can be expected ( Erasmus et al., 2015 ). Therefore, our laboratory will continuously test G. citri-aurantii EC 50 values to guazatine in citrus producing areas. Meanwhile, one should carefully control guazatine dosage, or use other method instead for the foreseeable future. The higher EC 50 value strains can cause decayed fruit with a generally used concentration of the guazatine treatment. Growth of sensitive strains were inhibited after high concentration guazatine treatment, leading to the resistance strains becoming more and more prevalent. This in turn could lead to high amounts of sour rot on citrus. Meanwhile, the above results remind us that the identification of commercially viable, effective, and alternative control methods have become an important challenge. On the other hand, to prevent sour rot of citrus from emerging during fruit storage, the resistance to guazatine needs to be monitored. The study showed that the average EC 50 value of the Ganzhou strains (10.3313 mg/L) was 125 times and 80 times higher than that of Guilin and Wuhan strains, respectively. These results indicated that there is a large difference in the resistance of the G. citri-aurantii isolates in different citrus production areas with a reference to wild-type strain. This may be related to the amount of guazatine used during storage. Ganzhou was one of the most important citrus production areas in China. The result may implies that the resistance G.citri-aurantii strains was increased in the case of the use of high concentration guazatine every year in Ganzhou. Our data suggests that guazatine use needs to be controlled. Firstly, fungicide guidance must be carried out based on actual guazatine resistance detected in different citrus producing areas. Secondly, a more effective and safer alternative needs to be developed to inhibit infection by citrus sour rot as soon as possible. For example ( Soto-Muoz et al., 2020 ), it is feasible project to look at using that a small amount guazatine mixed with GRAS salt are used to soak citrus postharvest. In summary, this work showed the importance of controlling high concentration guazatine use in citrus production areas. Meanwhile, it was said that further increasing some fungicides residue levels will not be effective in improving control of resistance isolates, such as imazalil treatment Penicillium digitatum ( Erasmus et al., 2015 ). At the same time, the sporulation inhibition effect of IMZ is better expressed when it is applied in wax coatings than when applied in an aqueous solution ( Erasmus et al., 2013 ; Njombolwana et al., 2013 ). Therefore, we try to search for other environmentally friendly fungicides to control citrus sour rot on the one hand; and on the other, fungicides with alternative modes of action could be applied to reach the ideal effect. 5 Conclusion In the present study, two pairs of specific primers 2996-R&F and 4989-R&F were developed for distinguishing G. citri-aurantii from the other two Geotrichum species. In parallel, we identified 25 G.citri-aurantii isolates from three major citrus producing areas (Wuhan, Guilin and Ganzhou city) in China and determined the resistance to guazatine. Our analysis identified the isolate SF-9 from Ganzhou showed the highest resistance to guazatine (32.3578 mg/L). And the average EC 50 of the G.citri-aurantii from Ganzhou city (average EC 50 = 10.3313 mg/L) was 182 times than that of positive control AY-1. However, the average EC 50 of the G.citri-aurantii from Guilin (average EC 50 = 0.0826 mg/L) and Wuhan (average EC 50 = 0.1295 mg/L) were 2.2 times and 1.4 times. And all wild-type strains could cause disease in citrus, but ten wild-type strains (SF-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15) still give rise to disease with 1 mg/L guazatine treatment in vivo . In conclusion, our findings may be helpful to provide targets and references for identifing G. citri-aurantii and controling guazatine use.
