    "full_text": "Uneven coloration is a common phenomenon in citrus fruit during the ripening stage, as affects the appearance and economic value of the fruit. The elevated expression of CsERF003 during the degreening process of both lemon and satsuma mandarin peels was reported. In this research, a similar performance of CsERF003 in the pericarp coloration process was also identified by transcriptome analysis of 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange and Lane Late navel orange. However, the regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 is not clear yet. Overexpression of CsERF003 could deepen the color of citrus callus and promote peel degreening of Newhall navel orange, which was attributed to the upregulation of genes involved in chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid synthesis. Furthermore, CsERF003 acted as an activator to promote the expression of CsLCYE , but couldn’t activate the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 ; CsERF003 could also bind to the promoter of CsSGR to activate its expression. Together, our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 in chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation, particularly in the α-branch of carotenoid metabolism. These insights offer valuable perspectives for the genetic enhancement of peel coloration in citrus."

          "Citrus is one of the world's most important fruit crops and the third most traded agricultural product globally. Color is a critical factor in determining the quality and commercial value of citrus fruit ( Zheng et al., 2019 ). As the citrus ripens, a dynamic color change from green to orange is observed in the peel due to the degradation of chlorophyll and the accumulation of carotenoids ( Lado et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2021b ). However, uneven degreening often occurs, affecting the outer-appearance quality and reducing commercial potential ( Zhou et al., 2010 ). A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying fruit coloration during ripening will favor citrus genetic improvement and promotion of fruit coloration.",
          "In previous studies, the molecular mechanism of the coloration has been elucidated to some extent. For example, SGR (STAY-GREEN), PPH (pheophytin pheophorbide hydrolase), and RCCR (red chlorophyll catabolite reductase) are involved in the breakdown of chlorophyll ( Kuai et al., 2018 ). Transcription factors, including CsMADS3 , VvERF17 , MdERF17 , and LcNAC002 , play important roles in chlorophyll degradation by activating the transcription of related enzymes ( Lu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023 ). On the other hand, carotenoid synthesis involves the synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to phytoene, which is then converted to lycopene through the catalytic action of PDS, ZISO, ZDS, CRTISO ( Sun et al., 2018 ). Lycopene is cyclized by different enzymes to form different carotenoid compounds, which are known as the α-branch and β-branch ( Cunningham and Gantt, 2001; Pecker et al., 1996 ). In the α-branch, lycopene is catalyzed by LCYE to form δ-carotene. Subsequently, δ-carotene is cyclized by LCYB to α-carotene, which in turn forms lutein. In the β-branch, lycopene undergoes two steps of cyclization by LCYB to form γ-carotene and β-carotene, respectively ( Cunningham et al., 1996 ). Regulating the expression of genes related to carotenoid metabolism could control the metabolic flow of carotenoids, which affects fruit color. For example, SlGCR could directly bind to the SlLCYE promoter and activate the expression of the SlLCYE to enhance lutein synthesis in tomato ( Ren et al., 2022 ). CsMADS6 promotes an increase in β, β-xanthophyll by activating the expression of CsLCYB1 in citrus ( Lu et al., 2018 ). MaERF124 , a transcriptional repressor, directly targets the carotenoid biosynthesis gene MaLCYB1.2 , resulting in the inhibition of carotenoid accumulation ( Cai et al., 2023 ).",
          "AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding factors) transcription factors play a significant role in regulating various biological processes, including growth, development, and response to environmental stimuli ( Feng et al., 2020 ). Recent studies have implicated them in the transcriptional regulation of chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation, e.g. SlERF6 , VvERF17 , MaERF124 , MdERF17 , MdAP2–34, and CsERF061 et al. ( Cai et al., 2023; Dang et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2021a ). CsERF003 , a member of the AP2/ERF family of transcription factors, increases in expression in the pericarp of lemon and satsuma mandarin as fruit development progresses ( Mitalo et al., 2022; Mitalo et al., 2020 ). These findings suggest that CsERF003 may play an important regulatory role in citrus peel coloration. However, further studies are needed to determine the specific function of CsERF003 in the process of coloration and its regulatory mechanism.",
          "In this study, CsERF003 was identified through transcriptome analysis of 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange and Lane Late navel orange ( Feng et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021b ). And the expression of CsERF003 was up-regulated during the development of Newhall navel orange peel. Overexpression of CsERF003 promoted the degreening of Newhall navel orange peel and deepened the color of citrus callus, further demonstrating the function of CsERF003 in citrus fruit coloration. Further studies showed that CsERF003 could bind to the CsSGR promoter and promote chlorophyll degradation. Interestingly, CsERF003 could bind to the CsLCYE promoter to activate its expression, but couldn’t activate the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 , suggesting that CsERF003 regulated the carotenoid metabolism to shift to the α-branching pathway, which further promoted the increase of lutein and the accumulation of carotenoids. In conclusion, this study revealed the regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 on chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation during citrus fruit peel coloration, which provides a valuable theoretical basis for improving the color quality of citrus fruits in the future."

              "To identify the transcription factors involved in the regulation of citrus peel color, this study analyzed previously reported transcriptome data from two citrus cultivars during peel development ( Fig. 1 A, Fig. S1 ), including 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange ( Feng et al., 2021 ) and Lane Late navel orange ( Zhu et al., 2021b ). The differential expression analysis focused on the pericarp transcriptome during both the green and orange-yellow periods. In 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange, a total of 1606 DEGs (585 up-regulated and 1021 down-regulated) were identified at 180 DAF compared to 120 DAF ( Fig. S2A , B). Similarly, in Lane Late navel orange, at 230 DAF compared to 190 DAF, a total of 1860 DEGs (626 up-regulated and 1234 down-regulated) were identified ( Fig. S2A , C). A total of 655 common DEGs in both varieties were obtained, consisting of 179 up-regulated genes and 445 down-regulated genes ( Fig. 1 B). Transcription factors were also analyzed ( Table S4 ), and among the up-regulated expressed transcription factors were mainly ERF, bHLH, BBX family ( Fig. 1 C). Further, compared to other transcription factors, CsERF061 , CsERF003 , and CsRVE1 showed significantly higher expression ( Fig. 1 D), suggesting their potential role in regulating peel coloration. Previous studies have shown that the expression of CsERF003 in the rind of lemon and satsuma mandarin increases as fruit development progresses ( Mitalo et al., 2022; Mitalo et al., 2020 ). These findings suggest that C sERF003 might play a crucial regulatory role in regulating pericarp coloration. The gene expression of CsERF003 was investigated at four developmental stages of the pericarp of Newhall navel orange ( Fig. 1 E). The results showed that CsERF003 was significantly upregulated during fruit development at the later stages (120DAF, 150DAF, 180DAF) compared to the early one (90DAF) ( Fig. 1 F). Based on these findings, it could be inferred that CsERF003 potentially regulates the coloration of the peel."

              "To examine the conservation of CsERF003 homologs across species, a multiple sequence alignment was performed, including citrus, Arabidopsis, grape, tomato, and phalaenopsis. The alignment revealed a high conservation of the AP2 domain within these proteins ( Fig. 2 A). To determine the subcellular localization of CsERF003 , the ORF of CsERF003 was fused to EGFP (CsERF003-GFP) and transiently expressed in tobacco leaves, and CsERF003-GFP was only observed to fluoresce in the nucleus compared to PRI121-GFP and co-localized with the nuclear marker, suggesting that CsERF003 localized to the nucleus ( Fig. 2 B). Based on a yeast analysis with pGBKT7-CsERF003 expressed in AH109 yeast cells, the yeast cells harboring the pGBKT7-CsERF003 construct and the positive control (pGBKT7–53+pGADT7-RecT) grew successfully on SD/-Trp-His-Ade plates, while, the yeast with negative control (empty vector pGBKT7) didn’t grow ( Fig. 2 C). Transcriptional activity analysis in tobacco leaves showed that pBD-CsERF003 significantly activated reporter gene expression compared with the negative control pBD ( Fig. 2 D, E). Based on these findings, CsERF003 is a transcriptional activator and localized in the nucleus."

The color of three lines (OE-4, OE-7, and OE-9) were significantly darker than the wild type (Rm) ( Fig. 3 B), and quantitative results also showed significantly higher expression of CsERF003 ( Fig. 3 C). Meanwhile, overexpression of CsERF003 resulted in a substantial increase in carotenoid content in the callus. Further component analysis revealed a significant decrease in violaxanthin content, while the content of lutein was markedly increased in the transgenic callus lines ( Fig. 3 D). Together, these data indicated that CsERF003 induced a darker yellow color in the callus by increasing lutein levels suggesting a critical role in carotenoid metabolism."

              "Lycopene is the central branch point of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, which can form α-carotene by cyclization of LCYE and LCYB, or β-carotene by two-step cyclization of LCYB ( Zhao et al., 2022 ) ( Fig. 4 A). Therefore, we hypothesized that CsERF003 could promote the shift of carotenoid metabolism toward the α-branch by regulating the expression of LCYE and LCYB , leading to an increase in lutein content and a decrease in violaxanthin content. To test the hypothesis, the structural genes of the carotenoid metabolism pathway in transgenic callus lines using qRT-PCR. The expression of CsGGPPS , CsPDS , CsZISO , CsZDS , and CsCRTISO showed significantly higher in three independent transgenic callus lines ( Fig. 4 B, Fig. S3 ). Surprisingly, there was no difference in the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 , but the expression of CsLCYE was significantly increased ( Fig. 4 B). This suggested that CsERF003 had the potential to regulate lutein accumulation by modulating the expression of CsLCYE . To investigate whether CsERF003 could bind to the promoter of CsLCYE , the p CsLCYE -AbAi bait yeast was constructed, but it exhibited a strong self-activating ability, rendering AbA ineffective in inhibiting the strain's growth ( Fig. S4 ). Further, the promoter of CsLCYE was inserted into the upstream of the luciferase (LUC) gene in the reporter vector, respectively, and co-infiltrated with the overexpression vector containing CsERF003 in tobacco and callus ( Fig. 4 C). In vivo imaging, the fluorescence value was higher when the CsERF003 and the promoter of CsLCYE co-infected in tobacco leaves ( Fig. 4 D). Additionally, the relative luciferase expression driven by the promoter of CsLCYE was significantly higher in the presence of CsERF003 than the control (EV) by dual-luciferase assay in citrus callus ( Fig. 4 E), indicating that CsERF003 binds to the promoter of CsLCYE in the plant. In EMSA, CsERF003 specifically bound to the DRE motif in the CsLCYE promoter. Binding was weakened in the presence of cold probes, while the addition of mutant cold probes did not affect binding ( Fig. 4 F). These data suggested that CsERF003 could activate the transcription of CsLCYE . Not the same, CsERF003 could not activate the expression of CsPSY1 , CsPDS , CsLCYB1 , and CsLCYB2 , and even had a certain inhibitory effect on CsLCYB1 ( Fig. S5 ). These data demonstrate that CsERF003 activates the expression of the CsLCYE , shifts carotenoid metabolism toward the α-branch, and promotes lutein synthesis and accumulation."

              "Because the expression of CsERF003 was differentially expressed during fruit degreening, it was speculated that it might be involved in the chlorophyll degradation process. To investigate the underlying role of CsERF003 in mediating chlorophyll degradation, qRT-PCR analysis of genes involved in the chlorophyll degradation pathway was performed ( Fig. 5 A). Overexpression of CsERF003 resulted in significantly higher levels of CsNYC1 , CsNOL , CsSGR , CsPPH , CsPAO , and CsRCCR , but there was no difference in the expression of CsCLH ( Fig. 5 B). The yeast bait of p CsSGR -AbAi was constructed, and the results showed that the bait yeast cells containing the recombinant vector AD-CsERF003 could only be in the defective medium (SD/-Leu) with the addition of 200 ng/mL of AbA, indicating that the CsERF003 protein could interact with the CsSGR promoter in the yeast system ( Fig. 5 C). Notably, the fluorescence value was higher when CsERF003 and the promoter of CsSGR presented meantime in tobacco leaves ( Fig. 5 D, E). This was consistent with the observation that the relative luciferase expression driven by the CsSGR promoter was significantly higher in the presence of CsERF003 using a dual-luciferase assay in citrus callus ( Fig. 5 F). In EMSA, CsERF003 specifically bound to the DRE motif in the CsSGR promoter. Binding was weakened in the presence of cold probes, while the addition of mutant cold probes didn’t affect binding ( Fig. 5 G). These results suggested that CsERF003 could bind to the CsSGR promoter and activate its expression. Moreover, when CsERF003 was mixed with the promoters of CsNCY1 and CsRCCR to infect callus, there was no increase in relative luciferase expression compared to the control ( Fig. S6A , C). When CsERF003 was mixed with the promoter of CsPAO to infiltrate callus, relative luciferase expression increased but did not reach 1.5-fold ( Fig. S6B ). These results demonstrated that CsERF003 regulates the chlorophyll degradation pathway by activating the expression of CsSGR ."

            "paragraphs": [
              "The functional role of CsERF003 in peel coloration in citrus has not been fully understood. To uncover the role of CsERF003 in fruit coloration, we introduced the OE- CsERF003 and EV vectors into Agrobacterium and infiltrated into the peel of green Newhall navel orange. The peel of CsERF003 -OE in citrus was yellow-green after infiltration compared to the control, indicating that CsERF003 could promote coloration in the peel ( Fig. 6 A). Compared with the peel of an injected empty vector, the CCI value of the peel injected with CsERF003 -OE was significantly increased ( Fig. 6 C). Consistent with this, the expression of CsERF003 , CsLCYE , and CsSGR were significantly up-regulated in CsERF003 -OE citrus fruit peels relative to the control ( Fig. 6 B). The total chlorophyll content, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b content were also significantly reduced compared with the control ( Fig. 6 D). And the expression of CsPPH and CsPAO was not improved, while the expression of CsRCCR was significantly increased ( Fig. S7 ). The results of carotenoid content determination showed overexpression of CsERF003 decreased the content of lutein, α-carotene, and β-carotene in the pericarp, and there was no significant change in the content of violaxanthin ( Fig. 6 E). In addition, the expression of CsPSY1 and CsPDS were increased, but the expression of CsGGPPS , CsZISO , CsLCYB1 , and CsLCYB2 had no significant difference ( Fig. S8 ). Lutein is a co-pigment of the light-harvesting complex in photosynthesis, and dominates the green tissues of plants ( Holt et al., 2005 ). Chloroplast degradation that occurs before the onset of ripening impedes the synthesis and accumulation of lutein in the pericarp, and previous measurements have also shown that the lutein content of green fruits is higher than that of yellow and orange fruits in navel orange peel ( Zhu et al., 2021b ). This may explain the decrease in lutein levels in the pericarp and the increase in the callus after overexpression of CsERF003 . Meanwhile, the expression of CsLCYE was higher than that of 90 DAF at 120 DAF, 150 DAF, and 180 DAF, and the expression of CsSGR was higher than that of 90 DAF at 120 DAF and 150 DAF ( Fig. S9 ). Altogether, these data demonstrated that CsERF003 could activate the expression of CsLCYE and CsSGR to regulate chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation to promote coloration in citrus."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Uneven coloration negatively affects citrus quality and market value, so understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of peel coloration is essential to improve the appearance quality and market competitiveness of citrus. In this study, the CsERF003 was identified by transcriptome analysis of 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange and Lane Late navel orange ( Feng et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021b ), and its expression was up-regulated during the development of Newhall navel orange peel ( Fig. 1 ). This result is consistent with the previously reported increased expression of CsERF003 in lemon and satsuma mandarin fruits during peel degreening ( Mitalo et al., 2022; Mitalo et al., 2020 ). However, the function and regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 in the process of peel coloration remain unclear. This study found that overexpression of CsERF003 promotes degreening of Newhall navel orange peel and deepening of the color of the citrus callus, indicating that CsERF003 promotes citrus coloration ( Figs. 3 B, D, 6 A, C). Additionally, CsERF003 binds to the CsSGR promoter to activate its expression and promote chlorophyll degradation ( Fig. 5 ). Meanwhile, CsERF003 binds to the promoter of CsLCYE and activates its expression ( Fig. 4 ). However, it could not activate the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 ( Fig. S5 ). This suggests that CsERF003 regulates carotenoid metabolism to shift to the α-branching pathway, thereby increasing the accumulation of lutein. These results demonstrate the regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 in chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation during the coloration process in citrus fruits. This provides a scientific basis for improving the appearance quality and market value of citrus fruits.",
          "Lycopene cyclization is one of the key steps in the carotenoid metabolic pathway that determines the direction of carotenoid metabolism and the formation of metabolites ( Nisar et al., 2015 ). This process involves two branches: the α-branch and the β-branch. In the α-branch, LCYE and LCYB catalyze the conversion of lycopene to a-carotene, which is subsequently transformed into lutein. In the β-branch, LCYB catalyzes a two-step cyclization of lycopene to produce β-carotene ( Zhao et al., 2022 ). Previous studies on carotenoid metabolism regulation have primarily focused on the regulation of LCYB gene, for instance, transcription factors such as CsMADS6 , CsMADS5 , CsERF061 , CsPHL3 , and FcNAC22 , reported in citrus, promote carotenoid accumulation by regulating the expression of LCYB1 ( Gong et al., 2021a; Lu et al., 2021a, b; Zhu et al., 2021a; Zhu et al., 2023 ). Additionally, CsMADS3 and CrWRKY42 regulate carotenoid accumulation by controlling the expression of LCYB2 ( Chen et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023 ). However, there are few reports on LCYE regulation. SlGCR found in tomato regulates LCYE expression, promoting lutein accumulation ( Ren et al., 2022 ). Interestingly, in this study, CsERF003 was found to activate the expression of CsLCYE , but had no effect on the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 ( Fig. 4 , Fig. S5 ). This suggests that CsERF003 regulates carotenoid metabolism towards the α-branch by modulating the expression of CsLCYE , leading to increased lutein accumulation. In citrus, CsTT8 can directly bind the promoters of MEP pathway genes and CsLCYE to promote carotenoid synthesis and accumulation ( Sun et al., 2023a ). This study enriches the understanding of the regulation of the α-branching pathway of lycopene cyclization in citrus.",
          "During fruit development and coloration, both CsERF061 and CsERF003 were highly expressed ( Fig. 1 ), indicating their significant roles in regulating carotenoid metabolism. CsERF061 activated key genes of the β-branch of the carotenoid synthesis pathway (e.g., LCYb1 , BCH , ZEP ) to promote the accumulation of violaxanthin in peel ( Zhu et al., 2021a ). In contrast, CsERF003 increased the accumulation of α-branch lutein by activating the expression of LCYE ( Figs. 2, 4 ). As fruits ripen, an important transition occurs: the photosynthetically active chloroplasts differentiate into chromoplasts ( Lang et al., 2017 ). This degradation may disrupt or alter carotenoid homeostasis. However, maintaining carotenoid homeostasis is essential for normal plant growth and development ( Latari et al., 2015 ). Thus, increased expression of CsERF003 promotes the synthesis of α-branches, complements the regulatory network of carotenoid metabolism during fruit ripening, and contributes to the maintenance of carotenoid homeostasis.",
          "The study results offer significant insights into the function and regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 in peel coloration ( Fig. 1 ). However, further research is required to investigate its upstream regulatory signals. The previous postharvest treatment experiments showed that low temperature conditions induced the expression of ClERF3 and CuERF3 genes in lemon and satsuma mandarin ( Mitalo et al., 2022; Mitalo et al., 2020 ). Temperature may play a crucial role in regulating CsERF003 , as suggested by the available evidence. Low-temperature response elements are typically present in the promoters of genes induced by low temperature. However, when the promoter of CsERF003 was analyzed, no-low-temperature response elements were found ( Table S5 ). This suggests that temperature may regulate CsERF003 in other ways, such as by interacting with upstream regulatory genes or other proteins. Previous studies have shown that interactions among certain transcription factors play a crucial role in plant response to environmental stress and metabolic regulation ( Saibo et al., 2009 ). For instance, in Arabidopsis thaliana, ERF95 and ERF97 interact to regulate plant response to heat stress ( Hughes, 2021 ), while in Capsicum annuum, CaERF102 and CaERF111 interact with CaMYC2 to regulate capsaicin biosynthesis ( Song et al., 2023 ). Additionally, in Citrus, CsHB5 interacts with CsbZIP44 to promote carotenoid synthesis ( Sun et al., 2023b ). In this study, some differentially expressed transcription factors, such as CsRVE1 and CsERF061 ( Fig. 1 C, D), were also screened by transcriptome analysis, but whether they interact with CsERF003 needs to be further investigated.",
          "In addition, analysis revealed cis-acting regulatory elements associated with MeJA response in the promoter of CsERF003 , indicating its potential involvement in regulating the MeJA signaling pathway ( Table S5 ). Previous studies have shown that overexpression of CsERF003 in callus and fruits increases JA content and up-regulates the expression of JA biosynthetic genes ( Wan et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2022 ). MeJA is a crucial phytohormone that promotes chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation( Fang et al., 2020 ; Yue et al., 2022 ), may be responsible for the increased expression of CsPSY1 , CsZISO , CsGGPPS , CsPPH , CsPAO , CsRCCR and other genes ( Figs. 4, 5 , S3). This also suggests that CsERF003 may regulate the response to MeJA signaling and participate in the regulation of the expression of related genes during fruit coloration. Meanwhile, the promoter of CsERF003 contains multiple light-responsive elements ( Table S5 ), suggesting that it may be regulated by light. High-intensity light has been found to enhance the expression of carotenoid synthesis genes, leading to increased lutein production in Chlamydomonas ( Ma et al., 2019 ). Both red and blue light can promote the degradation of chlorophyll and the accumulation of carotenoids in tomato ( Xu et al., 2024 ). Red light could accelerate the transformation of kumquat fruits from green to orange-yellow color ( Gong et al., 2021a ). This may imply that CsERF003 is involved in the fruit coloring process under light regulation. Thus, the regulation of CsERF003 may be affected by temperature, light, and MeJA signaling, and it may interact with other transcription factors or proteins to perform its function. Further research could investigate the upstream regulatory genes and proteins associated with CsERF003 and the mechanism of their interactions during pericarp coloration. This will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of CsERF003 in regulating fruit coloration."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Citrus is one of the world's most important fruit crops and the third most traded agricultural product globally. Color is a critical factor in determining the quality and commercial value of citrus fruit ( Zheng et al., 2019 ). As the citrus ripens, a dynamic color change from green to orange is observed in the peel due to the degradation of chlorophyll and the accumulation of carotenoids ( Lado et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2021b ). However, uneven degreening often occurs, affecting the outer-appearance quality and reducing commercial potential ( Zhou et al., 2010 ). A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying fruit coloration during ripening will favor citrus genetic improvement and promotion of fruit coloration. In previous studies, the molecular mechanism of the coloration has been elucidated to some extent. For example, SGR (STAY-GREEN), PPH (pheophytin pheophorbide hydrolase), and RCCR (red chlorophyll catabolite reductase) are involved in the breakdown of chlorophyll ( Kuai et al., 2018 ). Transcription factors, including CsMADS3 , VvERF17 , MdERF17 , and LcNAC002 , play important roles in chlorophyll degradation by activating the transcription of related enzymes ( Lu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023 ). On the other hand, carotenoid synthesis involves the synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to phytoene, which is then converted to lycopene through the catalytic action of PDS, ZISO, ZDS, CRTISO ( Sun et al., 2018 ). Lycopene is cyclized by different enzymes to form different carotenoid compounds, which are known as the α-branch and β-branch ( Cunningham and Gantt, 2001; Pecker et al., 1996 ). In the α-branch, lycopene is catalyzed by LCYE to form δ-carotene. Subsequently, δ-carotene is cyclized by LCYB to α-carotene, which in turn forms lutein. In the β-branch, lycopene undergoes two steps of cyclization by LCYB to form γ-carotene and β-carotene, respectively ( Cunningham et al., 1996 ). Regulating the expression of genes related to carotenoid metabolism could control the metabolic flow of carotenoids, which affects fruit color. For example, SlGCR could directly bind to the SlLCYE promoter and activate the expression of the SlLCYE to enhance lutein synthesis in tomato ( Ren et al., 2022 ). CsMADS6 promotes an increase in β, β-xanthophyll by activating the expression of CsLCYB1 in citrus ( Lu et al., 2018 ). MaERF124 , a transcriptional repressor, directly targets the carotenoid biosynthesis gene MaLCYB1.2 , resulting in the inhibition of carotenoid accumulation ( Cai et al., 2023 ). AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding factors) transcription factors play a significant role in regulating various biological processes, including growth, development, and response to environmental stimuli ( Feng et al., 2020 ). Recent studies have implicated them in the transcriptional regulation of chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation, e.g. SlERF6 , VvERF17 , MaERF124 , MdERF17 , MdAP2–34, and CsERF061 et al. ( Cai et al., 2023; Dang et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2021a ). CsERF003 , a member of the AP2/ERF family of transcription factors, increases in expression in the pericarp of lemon and satsuma mandarin as fruit development progresses ( Mitalo et al., 2022; Mitalo et al., 2020 ). These findings suggest that CsERF003 may play an important regulatory role in citrus peel coloration. However, further studies are needed to determine the specific function of CsERF003 in the process of coloration and its regulatory mechanism. In this study, CsERF003 was identified through transcriptome analysis of 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange and Lane Late navel orange ( Feng et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021b ). And the expression of CsERF003 was up-regulated during the development of Newhall navel orange peel. Overexpression of CsERF003 promoted the degreening of Newhall navel orange peel and deepened the color of citrus callus, further demonstrating the function of CsERF003 in citrus fruit coloration. Further studies showed that CsERF003 could bind to the CsSGR promoter and promote chlorophyll degradation. Interestingly, CsERF003 could bind to the CsLCYE promoter to activate its expression, but couldn’t activate the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 , suggesting that CsERF003 regulated the carotenoid metabolism to shift to the α-branching pathway, which further promoted the increase of lutein and the accumulation of carotenoids. In conclusion, this study revealed the regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 on chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation during citrus fruit peel coloration, which provides a valuable theoretical basis for improving the color quality of citrus fruits in the future. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant material Fruits of Newhall navel orange ( C. sinensis Osbeck cv. ‘Newhall’) were collected from the orchard of the National Citrus Breeding Center, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. The citrus callus, derived from Marsh grapefruit ( C. paradise Macf., ‘Rm’), was sub-cultured on solid MT basal medium in darkness at 25 °C every 20 days. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until used. 2.2 Transcriptome analysis Transcriptome data from two varieties, 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange ( Feng et al., 2021 ) (PRJNA517400) and Lane Late navel orange ( Zhu et al., 2021b ) (PRJNA573296), were downloaded from public RNA-Seq depositions in the NCBI database. Expression levels were quantified as transcripts per kilobase per million mapped reads (TPM). Differential expression analysis was performed using the R package DEseq2 ( Love et al., 2014 ) with a threshold of log2 Fold Change > 1 and an adjusted P -value < 0.01. 2.3 Gene cloning and sequence analysis The reference sequence of CsERF003 (Cs4g_pb022130) was obtained from the Citrus Pan-genome to Breeding Database ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/ ). Primers listed in Table S1 were used for amplification. The full-length coding sequence (CDS) of CsERF003 was isolated from the peel of Newhall navel orange. Multiple sequence alignment of amino acid sequences was performed using the DNAMAN. 2.4 Subcellular localization The full coding sequence of CsERF003 without the stop codon was amplified and inserted into the PRI121 vector. The plasmids of the fusion recombinant vector CsERF003-GFP were extracted and purified using a Plasmid Midi Kit (QIAGEN) and then transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 for later use. The CsERF003-GFP bacterial solution was mixed with nuclear localization maker vector H2B-mCherry bacterial solution and co-injected into tobacco leaves ( Lu et al., 2018 ). Fluorescence signals were observed and detected using laser confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2, Leica) after 2.5 days. 2.5 Transcriptional activation assay in yeast cells and tobacco leaves The coding sequence (CDS) of CsERF003 was cloned into the pGBKT7 vector to generate the recombinant vector pGBKT7-CsERF003. The yeast strain AH109 was transformed with the recombinant vector, positive control (pGBKT7–53 + pGADT7-RecT), and negative control (empty vector pGBKT7). Transformants were spotted and incubated on selective media. The assay was performed as described previously ( Zhu et al., 2021a ), and the primer sequences used are listed in Table S1 . The reporter vector contains a GAL4 protein binding 5× GAL4 cis-binding domain downstream of the LUC reporter gene; the effector vector is linked to the CsERF003 gene fused to a GAL4 binding domain upstream of the vector. The assay was performed as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2021 ). 2.6 Stable transformation of citrus callus The CDS of CsERF003 was cloned into the overexpression vector pH7GW2D using the Gateway Cloning System. Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 containing pH7GW2D- CsERF003 was used to infect citrus callus. Transgenic callus was screened as described by Zheng et al ( Zheng et al., 2019 ). Positive callus was selected, purified, and cultured for more than 10 generations to obtain stable inherited positive lines. Highly expressed positive lines were obtained through quantitative analysis after RNA extraction. 2.7 Fruit transient injection experiment The CDS of CsERF003 was cloned into the overexpression vector pK7GW2D via the Gateway Cloning System. Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 was used for overexpression. The method of transient injection of fruit was carried out according to previous reports ( Gong et al., 2021b ). Injection of CsERF003 or the empty vector PK7WG2D (negative control) was performed on the peel of Newhall navel oranges 90 days after flowering. Fluorescent signals were observed around the injection hole one week after injection, and the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. 2.8 Real-time quantitative PCR analysis RNA extraction from citrus callus and fruits was performed using Thermo Fisher's TRIzol™ reagent (Cat.No.:15596026). cDNA synthesis was carried out using the HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Cat.No.:R223). Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Roche LightCycler® 480 system. The qPCR reactions were prepared using the Hieff UNICON® Universal Blue qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Cat.No.:1184ES). The cycling conditions and parameters were as follows: 45 cycles. The data were analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔCt method, with the citrus Actin gene serving as an internal control. Primer sequences for RT-qPCR analysis of the carotenoid pathway are shown in Table S2 and primer sequences for RT-qPCR analysis of the chlorophyll pathway are shown in Table S3 . 2.9 Yeast one-hybrid assay The promoter sequences of CsLCYE and CsSGR were cloned into pAbAi vectors and used to transform the Y1HGold yeast strain. Then, the bait strains were transformed with the CsERF003-PGADT7 fusion plasmid. The cotransformed yeast cells were cultured on SD/-Leu agar plates with or without aureobasidin A (AbA) and incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 d. 2.10 Dual luciferase reporter assay The dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted with slight modifications based on previously reported methods ( Lu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021 ). For the DNA promoter interaction assay, the promoters of CsLCYE and Cs SGR , approximately 1.5 kb upstream of the translation start site, were amplified and cloned into the pGreenII 0800-LUC vector to generate reporter genes. The empty vector PK7WG2D (PK7) served as the negative control, and the PK7-CsERF003 structure was used as the effector. The effector and reporter were mixed in a 5:1 ratio for callus and tobacco. After 3 days of injection, luciferase (LUC) activity was visualized in vivo using the Plant Fluorescent Imaging System (NightShade LB 985) following the application of luciferin on tobacco leaves. The LUC and REN (internal control) values of the callus were measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Cat.No.:11402ES) according to the kit instructions. The relative luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of LUC/REN. 2.11 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The CDS of CsERF003 was subcloned into the pET-32a vector to generate CsERF003-His. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into the Rosetta strain (Novagen, USA) for induction by 0.2 mM IPTG at 16 °C for 20 h. The 3’biotin-labeled probes were synthesized by Sangon Company. The sequences are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . Primers were listed in Table S1 . The experimental procedure followed the instructions provided in the Biyuntian Chemiluminescence EMSA Kit (Cat. No.: GS009). 2.12 Determination of CCI, carotenoid and chlorophyll content Color measurement was carried out with a colorimeter (Konica Minolta CM-26dG, Japan) at near the injection hole in the fruit. The citrus color index (CCI) was calculated using the formula CCI = 1000 × a*/ (L* × b*). The carotenoid content was determined following a previous method ( Zheng et al., 2019 ) with slight modifications. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to separate the different carotenoid fractions in the healing callus and pericarp. To determine chlorophyll content in the pericarp, chlorophyll was extracted using a formulation of acetone and ethanol extracts. The extraction process was carried out for 16 hours at 4°C. The absorbance values at 645 nm and 663 nm were measured using a spectrophotometer, and these values were utilized to calculate the content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll. 2.13 Statistical analysis The data in the figure legends are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance tests were conducted using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA) and Microsoft Excel 2016. Normality tests were performed in the following order: the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test with Dallal-Wilkinson-Lilliefor P value and the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. For normally distributed data, one-way ANOVA was used for multiple-group comparisons, and unpaired t-tests (parametric tests) were used for two-group comparisons. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn's test was used for multiple group comparisons, and unpaired t-tests (nonparametric tests) were used for two group comparisons. All statistical tests were two-tailed and compared groups of biological replicates. After ANOVA analysis, Turkey's multiple comparison test was used to determine the p -value between the two conditions. The results of these tests are referred to as Anova post-test. Significance values were denoted as p values < 0.05(*), p < 0.01(**), and p < 0.001(***). 3 Results 3.1 CsERF003 is a potential candidate gene for regulating the coloration of citrus peel To identify the transcription factors involved in the regulation of citrus peel color, this study analyzed previously reported transcriptome data from two citrus cultivars during peel development ( Fig. 1 A, Fig. S1 ), including 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange ( Feng et al., 2021 ) and Lane Late navel orange ( Zhu et al., 2021b ). The differential expression analysis focused on the pericarp transcriptome during both the green and orange-yellow periods. In 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange, a total of 1606 DEGs (585 up-regulated and 1021 down-regulated) were identified at 180 DAF compared to 120 DAF ( Fig. S2A , B). Similarly, in Lane Late navel orange, at 230 DAF compared to 190 DAF, a total of 1860 DEGs (626 up-regulated and 1234 down-regulated) were identified ( Fig. S2A , C). A total of 655 common DEGs in both varieties were obtained, consisting of 179 up-regulated genes and 445 down-regulated genes ( Fig. 1 B). Transcription factors were also analyzed ( Table S4 ), and among the up-regulated expressed transcription factors were mainly ERF, bHLH, BBX family ( Fig. 1 C). Further, compared to other transcription factors, CsERF061 , CsERF003 , and CsRVE1 showed significantly higher expression ( Fig. 1 D), suggesting their potential role in regulating peel coloration. Previous studies have shown that the expression of CsERF003 in the rind of lemon and satsuma mandarin increases as fruit development progresses ( Mitalo et al., 2022; Mitalo et al., 2020 ). These findings suggest that C sERF003 might play a crucial regulatory role in regulating pericarp coloration. The gene expression of CsERF003 was investigated at four developmental stages of the pericarp of Newhall navel orange ( Fig. 1 E). The results showed that CsERF003 was significantly upregulated during fruit development at the later stages (120DAF, 150DAF, 180DAF) compared to the early one (90DAF) ( Fig. 1 F). Based on these findings, it could be inferred that CsERF003 potentially regulates the coloration of the peel. 3.2 The transcriptional activator of CsERF003 is localized on the nucleus To examine the conservation of CsERF003 homologs across species, a multiple sequence alignment was performed, including citrus, Arabidopsis, grape, tomato, and phalaenopsis. The alignment revealed a high conservation of the AP2 domain within these proteins ( Fig. 2 A). To determine the subcellular localization of CsERF003 , the ORF of CsERF003 was fused to EGFP (CsERF003-GFP) and transiently expressed in tobacco leaves, and CsERF003-GFP was only observed to fluoresce in the nucleus compared to PRI121-GFP and co-localized with the nuclear marker, suggesting that CsERF003 localized to the nucleus ( Fig. 2 B). Based on a yeast analysis with pGBKT7-CsERF003 expressed in AH109 yeast cells, the yeast cells harboring the pGBKT7-CsERF003 construct and the positive control (pGBKT7–53+pGADT7-RecT) grew successfully on SD/-Trp-His-Ade plates, while, the yeast with negative control (empty vector pGBKT7) didn’t grow ( Fig. 2 C). Transcriptional activity analysis in tobacco leaves showed that pBD-CsERF003 significantly activated reporter gene expression compared with the negative control pBD ( Fig. 2 D, E). Based on these findings, CsERF003 is a transcriptional activator and localized in the nucleus. 3.3 Overexpression of CsERF003 could deepen the coloration in transgenic citrus callus To investigate the role of CsERF003 in regulating coloration in citrus, the constructs of pH7WG2D-CsERF003 were applied to citrus callus that assessed the function of CsERF003 ( Fig. 3 A). The color of three lines (OE-4, OE-7, and OE-9) were significantly darker than the wild type (Rm) ( Fig. 3 B), and quantitative results also showed significantly higher expression of CsERF003 ( Fig. 3 C). Meanwhile, overexpression of CsERF003 resulted in a substantial increase in carotenoid content in the callus. Further component analysis revealed a significant decrease in violaxanthin content, while the content of lutein was markedly increased in the transgenic callus lines ( Fig. 3 D). Together, these data indicated that CsERF003 induced a darker yellow color in the callus by increasing lutein levels suggesting a critical role in carotenoid metabolism. 3.4 CsERF003 could activate the CsLCYE to promote carotenoid accumulation Lycopene is the central branch point of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, which can form α-carotene by cyclization of LCYE and LCYB, or β-carotene by two-step cyclization of LCYB ( Zhao et al., 2022 ) ( Fig. 4 A). Therefore, we hypothesized that CsERF003 could promote the shift of carotenoid metabolism toward the α-branch by regulating the expression of LCYE and LCYB , leading to an increase in lutein content and a decrease in violaxanthin content. To test the hypothesis, the structural genes of the carotenoid metabolism pathway in transgenic callus lines using qRT-PCR. The expression of CsGGPPS , CsPDS , CsZISO , CsZDS , and CsCRTISO showed significantly higher in three independent transgenic callus lines ( Fig. 4 B, Fig. S3 ). Surprisingly, there was no difference in the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 , but the expression of CsLCYE was significantly increased ( Fig. 4 B). This suggested that CsERF003 had the potential to regulate lutein accumulation by modulating the expression of CsLCYE . To investigate whether CsERF003 could bind to the promoter of CsLCYE , the p CsLCYE -AbAi bait yeast was constructed, but it exhibited a strong self-activating ability, rendering AbA ineffective in inhibiting the strain's growth ( Fig. S4 ). Further, the promoter of CsLCYE was inserted into the upstream of the luciferase (LUC) gene in the reporter vector, respectively, and co-infiltrated with the overexpression vector containing CsERF003 in tobacco and callus ( Fig. 4 C). In vivo imaging, the fluorescence value was higher when the CsERF003 and the promoter of CsLCYE co-infected in tobacco leaves ( Fig. 4 D). Additionally, the relative luciferase expression driven by the promoter of CsLCYE was significantly higher in the presence of CsERF003 than the control (EV) by dual-luciferase assay in citrus callus ( Fig. 4 E), indicating that CsERF003 binds to the promoter of CsLCYE in the plant. In EMSA, CsERF003 specifically bound to the DRE motif in the CsLCYE promoter. Binding was weakened in the presence of cold probes, while the addition of mutant cold probes did not affect binding ( Fig. 4 F). These data suggested that CsERF003 could activate the transcription of CsLCYE . Not the same, CsERF003 could not activate the expression of CsPSY1 , CsPDS , CsLCYB1 , and CsLCYB2 , and even had a certain inhibitory effect on CsLCYB1 ( Fig. S5 ). These data demonstrate that CsERF003 activates the expression of the CsLCYE , shifts carotenoid metabolism toward the α-branch, and promotes lutein synthesis and accumulation. 3.5 CsERF003 could activate the CsSGR to regulate chlorophyll degradation Because the expression of CsERF003 was differentially expressed during fruit degreening, it was speculated that it might be involved in the chlorophyll degradation process. To investigate the underlying role of CsERF003 in mediating chlorophyll degradation, qRT-PCR analysis of genes involved in the chlorophyll degradation pathway was performed ( Fig. 5 A). Overexpression of CsERF003 resulted in significantly higher levels of CsNYC1 , CsNOL , CsSGR , CsPPH , CsPAO , and CsRCCR , but there was no difference in the expression of CsCLH ( Fig. 5 B). The yeast bait of p CsSGR -AbAi was constructed, and the results showed that the bait yeast cells containing the recombinant vector AD-CsERF003 could only be in the defective medium (SD/-Leu) with the addition of 200 ng/mL of AbA, indicating that the CsERF003 protein could interact with the CsSGR promoter in the yeast system ( Fig. 5 C). Notably, the fluorescence value was higher when CsERF003 and the promoter of CsSGR presented meantime in tobacco leaves ( Fig. 5 D, E). This was consistent with the observation that the relative luciferase expression driven by the CsSGR promoter was significantly higher in the presence of CsERF003 using a dual-luciferase assay in citrus callus ( Fig. 5 F). In EMSA, CsERF003 specifically bound to the DRE motif in the CsSGR promoter. Binding was weakened in the presence of cold probes, while the addition of mutant cold probes didn’t affect binding ( Fig. 5 G). These results suggested that CsERF003 could bind to the CsSGR promoter and activate its expression. Moreover, when CsERF003 was mixed with the promoters of CsNCY1 and CsRCCR to infect callus, there was no increase in relative luciferase expression compared to the control ( Fig. S6A , C). When CsERF003 was mixed with the promoter of CsPAO to infiltrate callus, relative luciferase expression increased but did not reach 1.5-fold ( Fig. S6B ). These results demonstrated that CsERF003 regulates the chlorophyll degradation pathway by activating the expression of CsSGR . 3.6 Transient overexpression of CsERF003 could promote the coloration of citrus peel The functional role of CsERF003 in peel coloration in citrus has not been fully understood. To uncover the role of CsERF003 in fruit coloration, we introduced the OE- CsERF003 and EV vectors into Agrobacterium and infiltrated into the peel of green Newhall navel orange. The peel of CsERF003 -OE in citrus was yellow-green after infiltration compared to the control, indicating that CsERF003 could promote coloration in the peel ( Fig. 6 A). Compared with the peel of an injected empty vector, the CCI value of the peel injected with CsERF003 -OE was significantly increased ( Fig. 6 C). Consistent with this, the expression of CsERF003 , CsLCYE , and CsSGR were significantly up-regulated in CsERF003 -OE citrus fruit peels relative to the control ( Fig. 6 B). The total chlorophyll content, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b content were also significantly reduced compared with the control ( Fig. 6 D). And the expression of CsPPH and CsPAO was not improved, while the expression of CsRCCR was significantly increased ( Fig. S7 ). The results of carotenoid content determination showed overexpression of CsERF003 decreased the content of lutein, α-carotene, and β-carotene in the pericarp, and there was no significant change in the content of violaxanthin ( Fig. 6 E). In addition, the expression of CsPSY1 and CsPDS were increased, but the expression of CsGGPPS , CsZISO , CsLCYB1 , and CsLCYB2 had no significant difference ( Fig. S8 ). Lutein is a co-pigment of the light-harvesting complex in photosynthesis, and dominates the green tissues of plants ( Holt et al., 2005 ). Chloroplast degradation that occurs before the onset of ripening impedes the synthesis and accumulation of lutein in the pericarp, and previous measurements have also shown that the lutein content of green fruits is higher than that of yellow and orange fruits in navel orange peel ( Zhu et al., 2021b ). This may explain the decrease in lutein levels in the pericarp and the increase in the callus after overexpression of CsERF003 . Meanwhile, the expression of CsLCYE was higher than that of 90 DAF at 120 DAF, 150 DAF, and 180 DAF, and the expression of CsSGR was higher than that of 90 DAF at 120 DAF and 150 DAF ( Fig. S9 ). Altogether, these data demonstrated that CsERF003 could activate the expression of CsLCYE and CsSGR to regulate chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation to promote coloration in citrus. 4 Discussion Uneven coloration negatively affects citrus quality and market value, so understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of peel coloration is essential to improve the appearance quality and market competitiveness of citrus. In this study, the CsERF003 was identified by transcriptome analysis of 'Fengjie 72–1' navel orange and Lane Late navel orange ( Feng et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021b ), and its expression was up-regulated during the development of Newhall navel orange peel ( Fig. 1 ). This result is consistent with the previously reported increased expression of CsERF003 in lemon and satsuma mandarin fruits during peel degreening ( Mitalo et al., 2022; Mitalo et al., 2020 ). However, the function and regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 in the process of peel coloration remain unclear. This study found that overexpression of CsERF003 promotes degreening of Newhall navel orange peel and deepening of the color of the citrus callus, indicating that CsERF003 promotes citrus coloration ( Figs. 3 B, D, 6 A, C). Additionally, CsERF003 binds to the CsSGR promoter to activate its expression and promote chlorophyll degradation ( Fig. 5 ). Meanwhile, CsERF003 binds to the promoter of CsLCYE and activates its expression ( Fig. 4 ). However, it could not activate the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 ( Fig. S5 ). This suggests that CsERF003 regulates carotenoid metabolism to shift to the α-branching pathway, thereby increasing the accumulation of lutein. These results demonstrate the regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 in chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation during the coloration process in citrus fruits. This provides a scientific basis for improving the appearance quality and market value of citrus fruits. Lycopene cyclization is one of the key steps in the carotenoid metabolic pathway that determines the direction of carotenoid metabolism and the formation of metabolites ( Nisar et al., 2015 ). This process involves two branches: the α-branch and the β-branch. In the α-branch, LCYE and LCYB catalyze the conversion of lycopene to a-carotene, which is subsequently transformed into lutein. In the β-branch, LCYB catalyzes a two-step cyclization of lycopene to produce β-carotene ( Zhao et al., 2022 ). Previous studies on carotenoid metabolism regulation have primarily focused on the regulation of LCYB gene, for instance, transcription factors such as CsMADS6 , CsMADS5 , CsERF061 , CsPHL3 , and FcNAC22 , reported in citrus, promote carotenoid accumulation by regulating the expression of LCYB1 ( Gong et al., 2021a; Lu et al., 2021a, b; Zhu et al., 2021a; Zhu et al., 2023 ). Additionally, CsMADS3 and CrWRKY42 regulate carotenoid accumulation by controlling the expression of LCYB2 ( Chen et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023 ). However, there are few reports on LCYE regulation. SlGCR found in tomato regulates LCYE expression, promoting lutein accumulation ( Ren et al., 2022 ). Interestingly, in this study, CsERF003 was found to activate the expression of CsLCYE , but had no effect on the expression of CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2 ( Fig. 4 , Fig. S5 ). This suggests that CsERF003 regulates carotenoid metabolism towards the α-branch by modulating the expression of CsLCYE , leading to increased lutein accumulation. In citrus, CsTT8 can directly bind the promoters of MEP pathway genes and CsLCYE to promote carotenoid synthesis and accumulation ( Sun et al., 2023a ). This study enriches the understanding of the regulation of the α-branching pathway of lycopene cyclization in citrus. During fruit development and coloration, both CsERF061 and CsERF003 were highly expressed ( Fig. 1 ), indicating their significant roles in regulating carotenoid metabolism. CsERF061 activated key genes of the β-branch of the carotenoid synthesis pathway (e.g., LCYb1 , BCH , ZEP ) to promote the accumulation of violaxanthin in peel ( Zhu et al., 2021a ). In contrast, CsERF003 increased the accumulation of α-branch lutein by activating the expression of LCYE ( Figs. 2, 4 ). As fruits ripen, an important transition occurs: the photosynthetically active chloroplasts differentiate into chromoplasts ( Lang et al., 2017 ). This degradation may disrupt or alter carotenoid homeostasis. However, maintaining carotenoid homeostasis is essential for normal plant growth and development ( Latari et al., 2015 ). Thus, increased expression of CsERF003 promotes the synthesis of α-branches, complements the regulatory network of carotenoid metabolism during fruit ripening, and contributes to the maintenance of carotenoid homeostasis. The study results offer significant insights into the function and regulatory mechanism of CsERF003 in peel coloration ( Fig. 1 ). However, further research is required to investigate its upstream regulatory signals. The previous postharvest treatment experiments showed that low temperature conditions induced the expression of ClERF3 and CuERF3 genes in lemon and satsuma mandarin ( Mitalo et al., 2022; Mitalo et al., 2020 ). Temperature may play a crucial role in regulating CsERF003 , as suggested by the available evidence. Low-temperature response elements are typically present in the promoters of genes induced by low temperature. However, when the promoter of CsERF003 was analyzed, no-low-temperature response elements were found ( Table S5 ). This suggests that temperature may regulate CsERF003 in other ways, such as by interacting with upstream regulatory genes or other proteins. Previous studies have shown that interactions among certain transcription factors play a crucial role in plant response to environmental stress and metabolic regulation ( Saibo et al., 2009 ). For instance, in Arabidopsis thaliana, ERF95 and ERF97 interact to regulate plant response to heat stress ( Hughes, 2021 ), while in Capsicum annuum, CaERF102 and CaERF111 interact with CaMYC2 to regulate capsaicin biosynthesis ( Song et al., 2023 ). Additionally, in Citrus, CsHB5 interacts with CsbZIP44 to promote carotenoid synthesis ( Sun et al., 2023b ). In this study, some differentially expressed transcription factors, such as CsRVE1 and CsERF061 ( Fig. 1 C, D), were also screened by transcriptome analysis, but whether they interact with CsERF003 needs to be further investigated. In addition, analysis revealed cis-acting regulatory elements associated with MeJA response in the promoter of CsERF003 , indicating its potential involvement in regulating the MeJA signaling pathway ( Table S5 ). Previous studies have shown that overexpression of CsERF003 in callus and fruits increases JA content and up-regulates the expression of JA biosynthetic genes ( Wan et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2022 ). MeJA is a crucial phytohormone that promotes chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation( Fang et al., 2020 ; Yue et al., 2022 ), may be responsible for the increased expression of CsPSY1 , CsZISO , CsGGPPS , CsPPH , CsPAO , CsRCCR and other genes ( Figs. 4, 5 , S3). This also suggests that CsERF003 may regulate the response to MeJA signaling and participate in the regulation of the expression of related genes during fruit coloration. Meanwhile, the promoter of CsERF003 contains multiple light-responsive elements ( Table S5 ), suggesting that it may be regulated by light. High-intensity light has been found to enhance the expression of carotenoid synthesis genes, leading to increased lutein production in Chlamydomonas ( Ma et al., 2019 ). Both red and blue light can promote the degradation of chlorophyll and the accumulation of carotenoids in tomato ( Xu et al., 2024 ). Red light could accelerate the transformation of kumquat fruits from green to orange-yellow color ( Gong et al., 2021a ). This may imply that CsERF003 is involved in the fruit coloring process under light regulation. Thus, the regulation of CsERF003 may be affected by temperature, light, and MeJA signaling, and it may interact with other transcription factors or proteins to perform its function. Further research could investigate the upstream regulatory genes and proteins associated with CsERF003 and the mechanism of their interactions during pericarp coloration. This will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of CsERF003 in regulating fruit coloration. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, our results support the involvement of CsERF003 in the process of citrus peel coloration. CsERF003 directly activates the expression of CsSGR and CsLCYE , which regulate chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation in the α-branch. This result is a valuable addition to the regulatory network of carotenoid metabolism, and provides a scientific basis for improving fruit appearance and quality.
