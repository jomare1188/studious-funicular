    "full_text": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alpha chain gene of the teleost fish gilthead seabream ( Sparus aurata ), Spau-DAA , has been characterized. We cloned, sequenced and studied its polymorphism, before evaluating its expression in resting seabream leucocytes, tissues and tumor cells as well as in primed leucocytes. A complete allele was obtained by overlapping sequence fragments obtained by RT-PCR. The full-length Spau-DAA*101 comprises 1840 bp with a 5′-UTR region of 84 bp, an ORF of 729 bp and a 3′-UTR of 1027 bp. The putative protein of 242 residues shows homology with known MHC class II alpha genes, varying from 71 to 28% in other fish and humans, respectively. The protein sequence showed all the important features: leader peptide, α1, α2 and CP/TM/CYT regions, conserved cysteines and N -glycosylation site. The phylogenetic tree shows that it is included in the cluster containing the Percomorpha subclass and far from the human and shark genes. It is polymorphic, as seen when we sequenced the complete ORF of 11 alleles showing most of the amino acidic changes in the α1 domain, where the peptide-binding region (PBR) is found. Spau-DAA mRNA expression was mainly found in peritoneal exudate leucocytes, head-kidney, spleen, thymus and gill. Minor expression was detected in gut, brain, liver and PBLs. RT-PCR expression studies in isolated leucocyte subpopulations revealed, for the first time in the literature, that acidophilic granulocytes show high MHC class II gene expression. Apart from these granulocytes lymphocytes also express the Spau-DAA gene, although other cell types may also do the same. Finally, incubation of head-kidney leucocytes with yeast cells or pathogenic bacteria up-regulates Spau-DAA gene expression whilst incubation with ConA, ConA + LPS or PHA does not. The possible involvement of the seabream MHC class II alpha gene in the fish defence and antigen presentation are discussed."

          "Teleost fish are the first vertebrate group to show an immune system that exerts innate and adaptive responses. Research has shown that both fish and mammalian immune responses and mechanisms seem to be very conserved. Cloning strategies have identified the presence of immune-related genes encoding IgM, TCR, CD3, CD4, CD8, RAG, MHC class I, β2-microglobulin, MHC class II, MHC class I/II loading pathways, cytokines or chemokines (see Manning, 1998; Nakanishi et al., 2002; Dijkstra et al., in press ). Unfortunately, the scarcity of fish cell lines and proper antibodies still hampers progress in this field, especially as regards their functioning and interactions.",
          "Knowledge of the MHC genes is crucial for understanding the antigen presentation and, therefore, how the T-lymphocytes adaptive immune response starts. The MHC produces two kinds of membrane-bound glycoproteins, class I and class II, responsible for binding and presenting processed antigens to CD8 + and CD4 + T lymphocytes, respectively. Teleost fish MHC is equivalent to its mammalian counterpart (as regards exon–intron organization, polymorphism as well as protein structure and composition) but the MH genes appear in different linkage groups and are not clustered ( Sato et al., 2000; Dixon and Stet, 2001; Dixon et al., 1996; Fujiki et al., 2001 ). So far, the MHC genes have been fully length or partially cloned and sequenced in more than 30 teleost fish species demonstrating their polymorphism and the variability of gene number copies (up to 17 in some species) ( Persson et al., 1999; Dixon and Stet, 2001 ). However, whilst most efforts has been directed at studying MHC evolution and population genetics only few reports have looked at gene/protein expression patterns or their regulation in fish.",
          "MHC class II is a heterodimer, with alpha and beta chains, expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and responsible for the presentation of exogenous antigens to CD4 + T lymphocytes. Although the expression of both chains is equivalent, the β chain has been chosen in most studies because of its higher degree of polymorphism than the alpha chain, although this hypothesis has not been consistently demonstrated ( Kasahara et al., 1992; Dixon et al., 1996; Godwin et al., 2000; Grimholt et al., 2000; Roney et al., 2004 ). Both chains consist of two variable extracellular domains (α1α2 or β1β2) and a conserved connecting peptide/transmembrane/cytoplasmic (CP/TM/CYT) region. While the most membrane distal α1/β1 domains are highly polymorphic and contain the peptide-binding region (PBR), the α2/β2 domains are less variable and contain important residues for CD4 contact. MHC class II gene/protein expression is mainly found in lymphoid tissues although it is also present in other tissues, like gills or liver ( Rodrigues et al., 1995; Koppang et al., 1998, 2003; Hansen et al., 1999 ). Functional studies have also shown the up-regulation of MHC class II gene expression upon in vitro or in vivo stimulation. However, although few studies have attempted to identify the leucocyte types forming the APCs, differences in the cell types found in different fish species show the need for more research on this topic ( Vallejo et al., 1992; Rodrigues et al., 1995; Koppang et al., 2003 ). So far, studies have suggested that monocytes/macrophages, melanomacrophages, lymphocytes (T and B), epithelial cells and dendritic-like cells are APCs in fish, although further studies are needed to increase our knowledge of fish MHC and its role and functioning in the immune response. With this aim, we set out to characterize the MHC class II alpha chain in the Mediterranean teleost gilthead seabream ( Sparus aurata )."

              "Sequence fragments obtained with first degenerated primers were seen to be true gilthead seabream MHC class II alpha. Subsequent RACE reactions with specific primers gave us the 3′- and 5′-UTR of the gene. The overlapping of several sequences resulted in the first full-length cDNA sequence of a Spau-DAA allele, called Spau-DAA*101 ( Fig. 1 ) according to the proposed nomenclature ( Klein et al., 1990 ). This allele consists of 84 bp 5′-UTR, 1027 bp 3′-UTR and a coding sequence of 729 bp codifying for a putative protein of 242 amino acids. The 729 bp predicted ORF contains a putative 72 bp leader peptide, a 249 bp α1 domain, a 285 bp α2 domain and a 120 bp CP/TM/CYT region, which agrees in length with other published sequences for teleosts. In the 3′-UTR region, the sequence preceding the start codon (TGAAG) is well conserved with the initiation consensus sequence (TGAAC) for eucaryotic cells ( Kozak, 1984 ). The 3′-UTR region contains the canonical polyadenylation signal and is much longer than in the rest of teleosts.",
              "The predicted protein of the Spau-DAA*101 allele has 242 amino acids and a predicted mass of approximately 27 kDa. It contains all the expected features of teleost fish MHC class II alpha ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). That is, a leader peptide of 24 residues, two extracellular domains (α1 with 83 amino acids and α2 with 95 amino acids) and a 40-residue connective peptide/transmembrane/cytoplasmic (CP/TM/CYT) region. Protein sequence was aligned to other known MHC class II alpha proteins ( Fig. 2 ). Spau-DAA homology goes from 71% with the striped bass ( Mosa ) to 28% with human ( HLA-DRA ). The cysteines involved in the intra-domain disulphide bridge of α1 (C12 and C65) and α2 (C107 and C193) domains are very well conserved as regards their position in all teleost fish, while the α1 domain cysteines are lacking in shark and human proteins. The PBR is in the α1 domain where most of the differences were observed. In the α2 domain the presence of residues important for contacting with CD4 (some well conserved) and a potential N -glycosylation site (NVT, position 127–129), were observed. This site is found in almost all the sequences though some differences in the target sequence and position are observed. As regards the CP/TM/CYT region, the connecting peptide is quite divergent, while the transmembrane and cytoplasmatic regions have been well conserved during evolution."

Differences were observed in all the Spau-DAA regions, but the greatest number of amino acidic substitutions, mainly non-synonymous, was present in the α1 domain ( Hughes and Hughes, 1995 ). In the α2 domain there were very few substitutions. However, the potential N -glycosylation site is lost in some of the alleles. Finally, in the CP/TM/CYT region there was very little variation, as occurs in other fish.",

To do this, the nucleotide sequences of the α2 domain of the known MHC class II alpha sequences were used ( Fig. 4 ). The tree shows that all teleost fish, which cluster together, diverged from the elasmobranches a long time ago, according to the known evolution rates for fish. HLA-DRA was chosen as outgroup. All the species belonging to the groups Acanthopterygii, Osteriophysii or Protacanthopterygii cluster together in separate branches."

              "We first investigated Spau-DAA gene expression in resting seabream specimens ( Fig. 5 ). Gene transcript was mainly detected in peritoneal exudate leucocytes and spleen, followed by expression in HK, spleen, gill and thymus, with very faint bands in liver and gut. Whilst no expression in muscle, testis, PBLs or the fin tumor cell line (SAF-1) was found after 30 cycles of amplification, longer PCR reactions gave very weak Spau-DAA mRNA level in brain and PBLs. Deeper analysis led us to investigate Spau-DAA expression in some leucocyte types. For this, we purified, by means of MACS, a leucocyte fraction consisting of G7 + cells or purified acidophilic granulocytes. The negative fraction (G7 − , composed of lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages) was subjected to FACS, to give a fraction consisting of purified lymphocytes (Ly; both T and B cells together). These fractions (G7 + , G7 − and Ly) were analysed for purity by flow cytometry, and were seen to be more than 98% pure ( Cuesta et al., 2005 ). Surprisingly, all the fractions were positive for Spau-DAA expression ( Fig. 5 C), which demonstrates for the first time that fish acidophilic granulocytes are able to express MHC class II genes. Expression of the IgM light chain gene, found in the G7 − and Ly fractions but not in the G7 + , was also used as a measure of fraction purity (data not shown).",

For this, head-kidney leucocytes were incubated for 4 h with exogenous antigens or mitogens, looking for up-regulation of the Spau-DAA expression ( Fig. 5 D). Firstly, incubation with phagocytable particles, S. cerevisiae yeast cells or the seabream pathogenic bacterium V. anguillarum ( Esteban et al., 1998; Rodríguez et al., 2003 ) greatly increased the expression of the Spau-DAA gene (3.1- and 2.4-fold, respectively), indicating that leucocytes might be acting as functional antigen-presenting cells. On the other hand, incubation with the mitogens ConA, ConA + LPS and PHA failed to up-regulate Spau-DAA mRNA expression."

          "Functional data had already suggested the presence of the MHC and of different lymphocyte subsets in fish (see Manning, 1998; Nakanishi et al., 2002 ). In this sense, antibody production, acute allograft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity and mixed leucocyte reactions are present in fish, as in mammals, indicating great similarities in the immune systems. Gene cloning and generation of specific antibodies have more recently identified the presence of some key molecules involved in the immune response (MHC, β2-microglobulin, TCR, CD3, CD4, CD8, etc.) ( Dixon and Stet, 2001 ; Nakanishi et al., 2002; Dijkstra et al., in press ). Future studies in fish immunology will try to elucidate to which extent the fish and mammalian immune response mechanisms are conserved or diverge.",
          "We have been working for more than two decades on the innate immune response of gilthead seabream and recent investigations have enabled us to identify and characterize key molecules involved in the immune response. With this study, we proposed to identify the seabream MHC class II alpha gene, named Spau-DAA following the accepted nomenclature ( Klein et al., 1990 ). By means of RT-PCR we obtained fragments of the Spau-DAA mRNA. Overlapping of the fragments provided the first known full-length Spau-DAA allele, Spau-DAA*101 , with 1840 bp and great homology with published fish MHC class II alpha sequences. The sequence contains 84 bp 5′-UTR, 1027 bp 3′-UTR and has a coding sequence of 729 bp (72 bp leader peptide, 249 bp α1 domain, 285 bp α2 domain and 120 bp of CP/TM/CYT region). The length of the 3′-UTR is greater than in salmonids and channel catfish ( Godwin et al., 2000; Grimholt et al., 2000 ). In the putative protein, of 242 amino acids and approximately 27 kDa, the extracellular domains, α1 and α2, contain four cysteines, which are involved in forming two disulphide bridges, and additional cysteines in the CP/TM/CYT region in normal positions and very well conserved, while the α1 cysteines are absent in shark and humans ( Kasahara et al., 1992 ). A potential N -glycosylation site is present in the Spau-DAA*101 allele at position 127–129, which is present in all the known MHC class II alpha sequences although the exact position varies slightly. All these sequence characteristics identify the Spau-DAA*101 as a true MHC gene. This allele was used to make a phylogenetic tree. The tree was constructed with the α2 domain mRNA sequence of the known MHC class II alpha, based on p -distances as calculated by MEGA ( Kumar et al., 2001 ). Spau-DAA*101 clustered close to the Percomorpha fish ( Teni , Stvi , Gaac , Mosa , Paol , Auha and Orni ) and closer to the Protacanthopterygii ( Onmy and Sasa ) than to the Osteriophysii ( Cyca , Dare and Bain ) reflecting proposed evolutionary lineage for fish.",
          "After cloning the Spau-DAA*101 allele, we performed an analysis to identify the polymorphism of the gene. By means of PCR and with primers annealing in the 5′- and 3′-UTR regions, we obtained a product containing the full ORF. The protein sequences of the 11 different alleles obtained were compared. As usual and was expected, the α1 region, which corresponds to the PBR, showed great variability and the substitutions were mainly non-synonymous ( Hughes and Hughes, 1995 ). Interestingly, some of the alleles did not contain the N -glycosylation site, as occurs in the catfish MHC class II alpha gene ( Godwin et al., 2000 ). However, this site is always present in the rest of known vertebrates with the exception of the shark, where this site is present in α1 instead of in α2 ( Kasahara et al., 1992; Hardee et al., 1995; van Erp et al., 1996 ). Although the presence of a N -glycosylation site is needed by calnexin in the MHC assembly process the existence of another site in the β chain might be sufficient for MHC assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Godwin et al., 2000 ). Anyway, the lack or presence of these N -glycosylation sites in the α and/or β chains has never been related with functional status. As regards the CP/TM/CYT region, there were few variations in the different alleles, which is also concordant with other fish.",
          "One of the less studied aspects of the fish MHC concerns to its expression. While MHC class I alpha is widely expressed in virtually all the cells and tissues, MHC class II is only present in the antigen-presenting cells. Thus, as in mammals, fish MHC class II is mainly expressed in lympho-myeloid tissues, as determined by the expression of either α or β chains ( Juul-Madsen et al., 1992; Sultmann et al., 1993; Rodrigues et al., 1995; Hansen et al., 1999; Koppang et al., 1998, 2003 ). In this sense, major expression was observed in head-kidney (fish equivalent to the bone marrow), thymus, spleen and gut in several fish species. In gilthead seabream, the main expression was found in PE leucocytes, thymus, spleen, head-kidney and gills, whilst minor expression was detected in PBLs, liver, gut and brain. This tissue-distribution seems quite reasonable given the leucocyte-type proportions and activation status. Thus, PE leucocytes are probably the most active and mature cells (mainly composed of active granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages), which agree with the high MHC class II alpha mRNA expression. On the other hand, gills and gut should also show high MHC gene expression because of their continuous contact with exogenous antigens. In the seabream, expression in the gills is comparable to that observed in head-kidney, but is very low in the gut compared with data found in other fish. The transcript was very low in brain and absent in muscle and testis, as occurs in rainbow trout ( Hansen et al., 1999 ). Finally, few fish tumor cell lines have been used in studies concerning the MHC. The seabream epithelial-like fin tumor cells (SAF-1) do not express MHC class II but the SHK-1 (an Atlantic salmon macrophage-like cell line) and RTS11 (a rainbow trout macrophage-like cell line) do ( Koppang et al., 1999; Brubacher et al., 2000 ). However, although some correlations have been made between MHC class II beta chain expression and Ig + leucocytes, they do not seem to be consistent because, for example, Ig − cells such as macrophages are probably the main antigen-presenting cells ( Rodrigues et al., 1995 ). Based on these observations we decided to study the Spau-DAA in purified leucocytes. Using a house-produced mAb specific for acidophilic granulocytes (G7) ( Sepulcre et al., 2002 ), and by means of MACS and FACS, we obtained fractions consisting of pure acidophilic granulocytes (G7 + ), pure lymphocytes (Ly) and G7 − leucocytes (lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages) ( Cuesta et al., 2005 ). Surprisingly, all the fractions express the MHC class II alpha chain. The expression of MHC class II gene in teleost fish acidophilic granulocytes (never before observed) suggests that these cells present antigens to fish CD4 + T cells although more molecular and functional studies should be performed to demonstrate this hypothesis. However, indirect observations have already suggested that this may occur. For example, acidophilic granulocytes (functionally equivalent to the mammalian neutrophilic granulocytes) are the main phagocytic cells in the head-kidney of gilthead seabream ( Esteban et al., 1998; Rodríguez et al., 2003 ) and are also involved in the innate cytotoxicity of xenogenic tumor cells ( Cuesta et al., 1999 ). Furthermore, V. anguillarum injection into the peritoneal cavity induces mobilization and redistribution of seabream acidophilic granulocytes, which later appear in the spleen with bacteria inside and perhaps presenting bacterial antigens ( Chaves-Pozo et al., 2005 ). Mammalian APCs are dendritic cells, macrophages, activated T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and epithelial cells ( Glimcher and Kara, 1992 ). In teleosts, B and T lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages, melanomacrophages, epithelial cells and dendritic-like cells have been shown to present antigens so far ( Vallejo et al., 1992; Koppang et al., 2003 ). Our data suggest it is reasonable to include the acidophilic granulocytes in this list. Although available data are not definitive teleost fish cells expressing the MHC class II gene and presenting the antigens seem to be more diverse than in mammals, reflecting the less specialized immune system functioning. However, more studies should be carried out with different techniques and more fish species in order to provide more evidence for these preliminary findings.",
          "Recent investigations have focused on the expression profile of immune-related genes after fish vaccination or exposure to infection. Among these genes are the MHC class I and/or II. Thus, some authors have demonstrated that, after immunization or viral/parasitic infection, the expression of MHC class II increased ( Koppang et al., 1998; Sigh et al., 2004; Takano et al., 2004 ), whilst others failed to find such an effect ( Saeij et al., 2003; Lindestrøm et al., 2004; Tafalla et al., 2005 ). In vitro, moreover, the SHK-1 cell line incubated with virus (ISA or IPN viruses) increased the expression of MHC class I and II ( Koppang et al., 1999 ). Available data seem to confirm that in fish, as in mammals, the regulation of the MHC is at transcription level, while the cell surface of MHC protein closely resembles mRNA levels ( Glimcher and Kara, 1992; Koppang et al., 2003 ). We incubated head-kidney leucocytes with yeast cells or pathogenic bacteria, both actively phagocytosed by acidophilic granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages in the seabream ( Esteban et al., 1998; Rodríguez et al., 2003 ). Both particles were seen to increase the mRNA levels of Spau-DAA after 4 h of incubation, suggesting their involvement in the antigen presentation. Although we have not demonstrated the existence of CD4 + T lymphocytes in seabream, they have been found in other fish species firstly by functional studies ( Tatner et al., 1987; Blohm et al., 2003 ) and more recently by cloning the CD4 gene ( Pancer et al., 2004; Suetake et al., 2004; Dijkstra et al., in press ). These data suggest that seabream possess functional MHC class II alpha genes and exogenous antigen administration up-regulates their expression. On the other hand, leucocyte incubation with B cell mitogens (ConA and PHA) and/or T cells mitogens (LPS) failed to increase the Spau-DAA gene expression. So far, LPS has been found to increase the MHC class II expression in trout head-kidney macrophages and the SHK-1 cell line ( Knight et al., 1998; Koppang et al., 1999 ) but not in the trout RTS11 cell line ( Brubacher et al., 2000 ). Moreover, whilst TNFα administered alone increased the MHC gene expression in mammals ( Glimcher and Kara, 1992 ), it failed to do so in trout head-kidney macrophages but acted synergistically when combined with LPS ( Knight et al., 1998 ).",
          "To conclude, we have studied the MHC class II alpha gene of the gilthead seabream, which possesses all the characteristics and conserved residues to be considered a true MHC class II alpha gene. It is polymorphic and mainly expressed in peritoneal exudate leucocytes, thymus, head-kidney, spleen and gills. The expression of MHC class II alpha has been demonstrated for the first time in acidophilic granulocytes suggesting they may be part of the antigen-presenting cells. Finally, Spau-DAA expression in head-kidney leucocytes is up-regulated by yeast cells and bacteria but is unaffected by ConA, PHA or ConA + LPS."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Teleost fish are the first vertebrate group to show an immune system that exerts innate and adaptive responses. Research has shown that both fish and mammalian immune responses and mechanisms seem to be very conserved. Cloning strategies have identified the presence of immune-related genes encoding IgM, TCR, CD3, CD4, CD8, RAG, MHC class I, β2-microglobulin, MHC class II, MHC class I/II loading pathways, cytokines or chemokines (see Manning, 1998; Nakanishi et al., 2002; Dijkstra et al., in press ). Unfortunately, the scarcity of fish cell lines and proper antibodies still hampers progress in this field, especially as regards their functioning and interactions. Knowledge of the MHC genes is crucial for understanding the antigen presentation and, therefore, how the T-lymphocytes adaptive immune response starts. The MHC produces two kinds of membrane-bound glycoproteins, class I and class II, responsible for binding and presenting processed antigens to CD8 + and CD4 + T lymphocytes, respectively. Teleost fish MHC is equivalent to its mammalian counterpart (as regards exon–intron organization, polymorphism as well as protein structure and composition) but the MH genes appear in different linkage groups and are not clustered ( Sato et al., 2000; Dixon and Stet, 2001; Dixon et al., 1996; Fujiki et al., 2001 ). So far, the MHC genes have been fully length or partially cloned and sequenced in more than 30 teleost fish species demonstrating their polymorphism and the variability of gene number copies (up to 17 in some species) ( Persson et al., 1999; Dixon and Stet, 2001 ). However, whilst most efforts has been directed at studying MHC evolution and population genetics only few reports have looked at gene/protein expression patterns or their regulation in fish. MHC class II is a heterodimer, with alpha and beta chains, expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and responsible for the presentation of exogenous antigens to CD4 + T lymphocytes. Although the expression of both chains is equivalent, the β chain has been chosen in most studies because of its higher degree of polymorphism than the alpha chain, although this hypothesis has not been consistently demonstrated ( Kasahara et al., 1992; Dixon et al., 1996; Godwin et al., 2000; Grimholt et al., 2000; Roney et al., 2004 ). Both chains consist of two variable extracellular domains (α1α2 or β1β2) and a conserved connecting peptide/transmembrane/cytoplasmic (CP/TM/CYT) region. While the most membrane distal α1/β1 domains are highly polymorphic and contain the peptide-binding region (PBR), the α2/β2 domains are less variable and contain important residues for CD4 contact. MHC class II gene/protein expression is mainly found in lymphoid tissues although it is also present in other tissues, like gills or liver ( Rodrigues et al., 1995; Koppang et al., 1998, 2003; Hansen et al., 1999 ). Functional studies have also shown the up-regulation of MHC class II gene expression upon in vitro or in vivo stimulation. However, although few studies have attempted to identify the leucocyte types forming the APCs, differences in the cell types found in different fish species show the need for more research on this topic ( Vallejo et al., 1992; Rodrigues et al., 1995; Koppang et al., 2003 ). So far, studies have suggested that monocytes/macrophages, melanomacrophages, lymphocytes (T and B), epithelial cells and dendritic-like cells are APCs in fish, although further studies are needed to increase our knowledge of fish MHC and its role and functioning in the immune response. With this aim, we set out to characterize the MHC class II alpha chain in the Mediterranean teleost gilthead seabream ( Sparus aurata ). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Animals, tissues, leucocytes and tumor cells Specimens (125 g mean weight) of the hermaphroditic protandrous seawater teleost gilthead seabream ( S. aurata L.) (Culmarex S.A., Murcia, Spain) were kept in running seawater aquaria at 20 °C and fed daily (1% biomass). Brain, muscle, liver, gut, gills, head-kidney (HK), spleen, thymus and testis were obtained by dissection and immediately frozen in TRIzol Reagent (Gibco) for RNA isolation. Leucocytes from peripheral blood (PBLs), peritoneal exudate (PE) and HK were isolated and adjusted in sRPMI [RPMI-1640 (Gibco) culture medium containing 2% FCS (GibcoBRL) and 0.35% NaCl]. Isolated leucocytes and seabream fin tumor cells (SAF-1; ECACC-00122301; maintained at exponential growth in sRPMI culture medium) were pelleted and also resuspended in TRIzol for RNA isolation. Other HK leucocyte samples were sorted or stimulated in vitro (see below). 2.2 PCR cloning and sequencing Total RNA was isolated from TRIzol Reagent frozen samples following the manufacturer's instructions. First strand of cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 1–5 μg of total RNA using the ThermoScript™ RNAse H − Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo-dT 12–18 primer (Invitrogen). cDNA was used in a first PCR amplification with degenerated primers ( Table 1 ) designed against known fish MHC class II alpha sequences. PCR reactions were carried out using Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and the amplification performed in a MasterCycler Gradient PCR: 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s; and followed by 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Photographs were taken with the GL 100 Imaging system (Kodak) and band intensity measured by the 1D Image Analysis Software v3.6 (Kodak). PCR fragments were purified from the gel and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Following transfection into competent Escherichia coli DH-5α cells, recombinants were identified through blue-white color selection in ampicillin Luria Broth Base plates, containing 40 mg/ml of X-Gal. Isolated plasmid DNA was sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 sequencer. Based on the first partial seabream MHC class II alpha sequence, specific primers were now designed ( Table 1 ) and used to obtain the 3′ and 5′ ends by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). In 3′-RACE, spleen cDNA was used in a PCR reaction using the MHC-F4 and RACET primers followed by a second round of PCR using SpauCIIAF6 and RACE primers. In 5′-RACE, an oligo-dT-synthetized spleen cDNA was treated with E. coli RNAse H (Gibco), purified with the Concert Rapid PCR Purification System (Gibco) and then the cDNA tailed with poly(A) at the 5′ end using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT, Gibco). PCR reaction was performed with MHC-R4 and RACET primers followed by another PCR reaction using SpauCIIR6 and RACE primers. 2.3 Sequence analysis All sequences were analysed for similarity with other known sequences using the BLAST program ( Altschul et al., 1990 ) within the ExPASy Molecular Biology server ( http://us.expasy.org ), which was also used to predict the protein structure. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out using the CLUSTALW program ( Thompson et al., 1994 ), within the European Bioinformatics Institute. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA Version 2.1 ( Kumar et al., 2001 ). 2.4 Polymorphism study In order to obtain different alleles of the seabream MHC class II alpha, Spau-DAA , cDNA from two different specimens was used in PCR reactions using specific primers SpauCIIAF8 and SpauCIIR7 whose amplicon contains the coding sequence. PCR products were cloned and sequenced as above. 2.5 HK leucocytes sorting HK leucocyte subpopulations were obtained by means of MACS (magnetic activated cell sorting) and FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) as previously described ( Cuesta et al., 2005 ). Briefly, 10 8 HK leucocytes were washed in MACS buffer (PBS with 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA), incubated with a house-produced G7 mAb (50 μl supernatant in 20 ml MACS buffer) specific for gilthead seabream acidophilic granulocytes ( Sepulcre et al., 2002 ) for 30 min, washed twice and resuspended in MACS buffer. Cells were then incubated with 100 μl of paramagnetically labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 min and washed again. Cells were separated using a MACS LS + /VS + column according to the protocol. Both the cells passing through (G7 − ; lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages) and remaining in the column (G7 + ; acidophilic granulocytes) were collected. The G7 − fraction was then applied to an EPICS ALTRA FACS (Becton Dickinson) in order to purify a third subpopulation consisting of lymphocytes (Ly) according to cell size. The purity of each fraction was checked by flow cytometry ( Cuesta et al., 2005 ). 2.6 HK leucocyte treatment in vitro Isolated HK leucocytes were incubated in vitro for 4 h with medium (control), heat-killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C (two yeast cells per leucocyte), heat-killed Vibrio anguillarum R-82 (5 bacterial cells per leucocyte) (pathogenic for seabream), ConA (5 μg/ml), LPS + ConA (10 and 5 μg/ml, respectively) or PHA (10 μg/ml). Leucocytes were washed and resuspended in TRIzol Reagent for total RNA isolation as above. 2.7 Spau-DAA gene expression cDNA obtained from brain, muscle, liver, gut, gills, HK, spleen, thymus and testis as well as from PBLs, PE leucocytes and SAF-1 was tested for Spau-DAA mRNA expression. Samples of the HK leucocyte fractions obtained by sorting or the in vitro treated HK leucocytes (see above) were also assayed. PCR reactions were carried out with SpauCIIAF10 and SpauCIIAR6 primers. As controls, cDNA of the constitutively expressed β-actin gene was amplified using specific primers ( Table 1 ). The expression of the IgM light chain gene was also used to check the fractions purity. The cycling reaction was performed as follows: 95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s; and finally 72 °C for 10 min. Those samples without amplification were also cycled for 60 cycles. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Band intensity was measured and normalized to that of β-actin . 3 Results 3.1 Cloning and sequence of the Spau-DAA Sequence fragments obtained with first degenerated primers were seen to be true gilthead seabream MHC class II alpha. Subsequent RACE reactions with specific primers gave us the 3′- and 5′-UTR of the gene. The overlapping of several sequences resulted in the first full-length cDNA sequence of a Spau-DAA allele, called Spau-DAA*101 ( Fig. 1 ) according to the proposed nomenclature ( Klein et al., 1990 ). This allele consists of 84 bp 5′-UTR, 1027 bp 3′-UTR and a coding sequence of 729 bp codifying for a putative protein of 242 amino acids. The 729 bp predicted ORF contains a putative 72 bp leader peptide, a 249 bp α1 domain, a 285 bp α2 domain and a 120 bp CP/TM/CYT region, which agrees in length with other published sequences for teleosts. In the 3′-UTR region, the sequence preceding the start codon (TGAAG) is well conserved with the initiation consensus sequence (TGAAC) for eucaryotic cells ( Kozak, 1984 ). The 3′-UTR region contains the canonical polyadenylation signal and is much longer than in the rest of teleosts. The predicted protein of the Spau-DAA*101 allele has 242 amino acids and a predicted mass of approximately 27 kDa. It contains all the expected features of teleost fish MHC class II alpha ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). That is, a leader peptide of 24 residues, two extracellular domains (α1 with 83 amino acids and α2 with 95 amino acids) and a 40-residue connective peptide/transmembrane/cytoplasmic (CP/TM/CYT) region. Protein sequence was aligned to other known MHC class II alpha proteins ( Fig. 2 ). Spau-DAA homology goes from 71% with the striped bass ( Mosa ) to 28% with human ( HLA-DRA ). The cysteines involved in the intra-domain disulphide bridge of α1 (C12 and C65) and α2 (C107 and C193) domains are very well conserved as regards their position in all teleost fish, while the α1 domain cysteines are lacking in shark and human proteins. The PBR is in the α1 domain where most of the differences were observed. In the α2 domain the presence of residues important for contacting with CD4 (some well conserved) and a potential N -glycosylation site (NVT, position 127–129), were observed. This site is found in almost all the sequences though some differences in the target sequence and position are observed. As regards the CP/TM/CYT region, the connecting peptide is quite divergent, while the transmembrane and cytoplasmatic regions have been well conserved during evolution. 3.2 Polymorphism and evolutionary analysis Up to 11 different alleles of the MHC class II alpha of the gilthead seabream, called Spau-DAA followed by the allele number, were found in two specimens ( Fig. 3 ). Differences were observed in all the Spau-DAA regions, but the greatest number of amino acidic substitutions, mainly non-synonymous, was present in the α1 domain ( Hughes and Hughes, 1995 ). In the α2 domain there were very few substitutions. However, the potential N -glycosylation site is lost in some of the alleles. Finally, in the CP/TM/CYT region there was very little variation, as occurs in other fish. Evolutionary relations were studied by constructing a phylogenetical tree. To do this, the nucleotide sequences of the α2 domain of the known MHC class II alpha sequences were used ( Fig. 4 ). The tree shows that all teleost fish, which cluster together, diverged from the elasmobranches a long time ago, according to the known evolution rates for fish. HLA-DRA was chosen as outgroup. All the species belonging to the groups Acanthopterygii, Osteriophysii or Protacanthopterygii cluster together in separate branches. 3.3 Expression of MHC class II alpha gene in seabream We first investigated Spau-DAA gene expression in resting seabream specimens ( Fig. 5 ). Gene transcript was mainly detected in peritoneal exudate leucocytes and spleen, followed by expression in HK, spleen, gill and thymus, with very faint bands in liver and gut. Whilst no expression in muscle, testis, PBLs or the fin tumor cell line (SAF-1) was found after 30 cycles of amplification, longer PCR reactions gave very weak Spau-DAA mRNA level in brain and PBLs. Deeper analysis led us to investigate Spau-DAA expression in some leucocyte types. For this, we purified, by means of MACS, a leucocyte fraction consisting of G7 + cells or purified acidophilic granulocytes. The negative fraction (G7 − , composed of lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages) was subjected to FACS, to give a fraction consisting of purified lymphocytes (Ly; both T and B cells together). These fractions (G7 + , G7 − and Ly) were analysed for purity by flow cytometry, and were seen to be more than 98% pure ( Cuesta et al., 2005 ). Surprisingly, all the fractions were positive for Spau-DAA expression ( Fig. 5 C), which demonstrates for the first time that fish acidophilic granulocytes are able to express MHC class II genes. Expression of the IgM light chain gene, found in the G7 − and Ly fractions but not in the G7 + , was also used as a measure of fraction purity (data not shown). Finally, we evaluated the modulation of Spau-DAA gene expression in vitro. For this, head-kidney leucocytes were incubated for 4 h with exogenous antigens or mitogens, looking for up-regulation of the Spau-DAA expression ( Fig. 5 D). Firstly, incubation with phagocytable particles, S. cerevisiae yeast cells or the seabream pathogenic bacterium V. anguillarum ( Esteban et al., 1998; Rodríguez et al., 2003 ) greatly increased the expression of the Spau-DAA gene (3.1- and 2.4-fold, respectively), indicating that leucocytes might be acting as functional antigen-presenting cells. On the other hand, incubation with the mitogens ConA, ConA + LPS and PHA failed to up-regulate Spau-DAA mRNA expression. 4 Discussion Functional data had already suggested the presence of the MHC and of different lymphocyte subsets in fish (see Manning, 1998; Nakanishi et al., 2002 ). In this sense, antibody production, acute allograft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity and mixed leucocyte reactions are present in fish, as in mammals, indicating great similarities in the immune systems. Gene cloning and generation of specific antibodies have more recently identified the presence of some key molecules involved in the immune response (MHC, β2-microglobulin, TCR, CD3, CD4, CD8, etc.) ( Dixon and Stet, 2001 ; Nakanishi et al., 2002; Dijkstra et al., in press ). Future studies in fish immunology will try to elucidate to which extent the fish and mammalian immune response mechanisms are conserved or diverge. We have been working for more than two decades on the innate immune response of gilthead seabream and recent investigations have enabled us to identify and characterize key molecules involved in the immune response. With this study, we proposed to identify the seabream MHC class II alpha gene, named Spau-DAA following the accepted nomenclature ( Klein et al., 1990 ). By means of RT-PCR we obtained fragments of the Spau-DAA mRNA. Overlapping of the fragments provided the first known full-length Spau-DAA allele, Spau-DAA*101 , with 1840 bp and great homology with published fish MHC class II alpha sequences. The sequence contains 84 bp 5′-UTR, 1027 bp 3′-UTR and has a coding sequence of 729 bp (72 bp leader peptide, 249 bp α1 domain, 285 bp α2 domain and 120 bp of CP/TM/CYT region). The length of the 3′-UTR is greater than in salmonids and channel catfish ( Godwin et al., 2000; Grimholt et al., 2000 ). In the putative protein, of 242 amino acids and approximately 27 kDa, the extracellular domains, α1 and α2, contain four cysteines, which are involved in forming two disulphide bridges, and additional cysteines in the CP/TM/CYT region in normal positions and very well conserved, while the α1 cysteines are absent in shark and humans ( Kasahara et al., 1992 ). A potential N -glycosylation site is present in the Spau-DAA*101 allele at position 127–129, which is present in all the known MHC class II alpha sequences although the exact position varies slightly. All these sequence characteristics identify the Spau-DAA*101 as a true MHC gene. This allele was used to make a phylogenetic tree. The tree was constructed with the α2 domain mRNA sequence of the known MHC class II alpha, based on p -distances as calculated by MEGA ( Kumar et al., 2001 ). Spau-DAA*101 clustered close to the Percomorpha fish ( Teni , Stvi , Gaac , Mosa , Paol , Auha and Orni ) and closer to the Protacanthopterygii ( Onmy and Sasa ) than to the Osteriophysii ( Cyca , Dare and Bain ) reflecting proposed evolutionary lineage for fish. After cloning the Spau-DAA*101 allele, we performed an analysis to identify the polymorphism of the gene. By means of PCR and with primers annealing in the 5′- and 3′-UTR regions, we obtained a product containing the full ORF. The protein sequences of the 11 different alleles obtained were compared. As usual and was expected, the α1 region, which corresponds to the PBR, showed great variability and the substitutions were mainly non-synonymous ( Hughes and Hughes, 1995 ). Interestingly, some of the alleles did not contain the N -glycosylation site, as occurs in the catfish MHC class II alpha gene ( Godwin et al., 2000 ). However, this site is always present in the rest of known vertebrates with the exception of the shark, where this site is present in α1 instead of in α2 ( Kasahara et al., 1992; Hardee et al., 1995; van Erp et al., 1996 ). Although the presence of a N -glycosylation site is needed by calnexin in the MHC assembly process the existence of another site in the β chain might be sufficient for MHC assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Godwin et al., 2000 ). Anyway, the lack or presence of these N -glycosylation sites in the α and/or β chains has never been related with functional status. As regards the CP/TM/CYT region, there were few variations in the different alleles, which is also concordant with other fish. One of the less studied aspects of the fish MHC concerns to its expression. While MHC class I alpha is widely expressed in virtually all the cells and tissues, MHC class II is only present in the antigen-presenting cells. Thus, as in mammals, fish MHC class II is mainly expressed in lympho-myeloid tissues, as determined by the expression of either α or β chains ( Juul-Madsen et al., 1992; Sultmann et al., 1993; Rodrigues et al., 1995; Hansen et al., 1999; Koppang et al., 1998, 2003 ). In this sense, major expression was observed in head-kidney (fish equivalent to the bone marrow), thymus, spleen and gut in several fish species. In gilthead seabream, the main expression was found in PE leucocytes, thymus, spleen, head-kidney and gills, whilst minor expression was detected in PBLs, liver, gut and brain. This tissue-distribution seems quite reasonable given the leucocyte-type proportions and activation status. Thus, PE leucocytes are probably the most active and mature cells (mainly composed of active granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages), which agree with the high MHC class II alpha mRNA expression. On the other hand, gills and gut should also show high MHC gene expression because of their continuous contact with exogenous antigens. In the seabream, expression in the gills is comparable to that observed in head-kidney, but is very low in the gut compared with data found in other fish. The transcript was very low in brain and absent in muscle and testis, as occurs in rainbow trout ( Hansen et al., 1999 ). Finally, few fish tumor cell lines have been used in studies concerning the MHC. The seabream epithelial-like fin tumor cells (SAF-1) do not express MHC class II but the SHK-1 (an Atlantic salmon macrophage-like cell line) and RTS11 (a rainbow trout macrophage-like cell line) do ( Koppang et al., 1999; Brubacher et al., 2000 ). However, although some correlations have been made between MHC class II beta chain expression and Ig + leucocytes, they do not seem to be consistent because, for example, Ig − cells such as macrophages are probably the main antigen-presenting cells ( Rodrigues et al., 1995 ). Based on these observations we decided to study the Spau-DAA in purified leucocytes. Using a house-produced mAb specific for acidophilic granulocytes (G7) ( Sepulcre et al., 2002 ), and by means of MACS and FACS, we obtained fractions consisting of pure acidophilic granulocytes (G7 + ), pure lymphocytes (Ly) and G7 − leucocytes (lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages) ( Cuesta et al., 2005 ). Surprisingly, all the fractions express the MHC class II alpha chain. The expression of MHC class II gene in teleost fish acidophilic granulocytes (never before observed) suggests that these cells present antigens to fish CD4 + T cells although more molecular and functional studies should be performed to demonstrate this hypothesis. However, indirect observations have already suggested that this may occur. For example, acidophilic granulocytes (functionally equivalent to the mammalian neutrophilic granulocytes) are the main phagocytic cells in the head-kidney of gilthead seabream ( Esteban et al., 1998; Rodríguez et al., 2003 ) and are also involved in the innate cytotoxicity of xenogenic tumor cells ( Cuesta et al., 1999 ). Furthermore, V. anguillarum injection into the peritoneal cavity induces mobilization and redistribution of seabream acidophilic granulocytes, which later appear in the spleen with bacteria inside and perhaps presenting bacterial antigens ( Chaves-Pozo et al., 2005 ). Mammalian APCs are dendritic cells, macrophages, activated T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and epithelial cells ( Glimcher and Kara, 1992 ). In teleosts, B and T lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages, melanomacrophages, epithelial cells and dendritic-like cells have been shown to present antigens so far ( Vallejo et al., 1992; Koppang et al., 2003 ). Our data suggest it is reasonable to include the acidophilic granulocytes in this list. Although available data are not definitive teleost fish cells expressing the MHC class II gene and presenting the antigens seem to be more diverse than in mammals, reflecting the less specialized immune system functioning. However, more studies should be carried out with different techniques and more fish species in order to provide more evidence for these preliminary findings. Recent investigations have focused on the expression profile of immune-related genes after fish vaccination or exposure to infection. Among these genes are the MHC class I and/or II. Thus, some authors have demonstrated that, after immunization or viral/parasitic infection, the expression of MHC class II increased ( Koppang et al., 1998; Sigh et al., 2004; Takano et al., 2004 ), whilst others failed to find such an effect ( Saeij et al., 2003; Lindestrøm et al., 2004; Tafalla et al., 2005 ). In vitro, moreover, the SHK-1 cell line incubated with virus (ISA or IPN viruses) increased the expression of MHC class I and II ( Koppang et al., 1999 ). Available data seem to confirm that in fish, as in mammals, the regulation of the MHC is at transcription level, while the cell surface of MHC protein closely resembles mRNA levels ( Glimcher and Kara, 1992; Koppang et al., 2003 ). We incubated head-kidney leucocytes with yeast cells or pathogenic bacteria, both actively phagocytosed by acidophilic granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages in the seabream ( Esteban et al., 1998; Rodríguez et al., 2003 ). Both particles were seen to increase the mRNA levels of Spau-DAA after 4 h of incubation, suggesting their involvement in the antigen presentation. Although we have not demonstrated the existence of CD4 + T lymphocytes in seabream, they have been found in other fish species firstly by functional studies ( Tatner et al., 1987; Blohm et al., 2003 ) and more recently by cloning the CD4 gene ( Pancer et al., 2004; Suetake et al., 2004; Dijkstra et al., in press ). These data suggest that seabream possess functional MHC class II alpha genes and exogenous antigen administration up-regulates their expression. On the other hand, leucocyte incubation with B cell mitogens (ConA and PHA) and/or T cells mitogens (LPS) failed to increase the Spau-DAA gene expression. So far, LPS has been found to increase the MHC class II expression in trout head-kidney macrophages and the SHK-1 cell line ( Knight et al., 1998; Koppang et al., 1999 ) but not in the trout RTS11 cell line ( Brubacher et al., 2000 ). Moreover, whilst TNFα administered alone increased the MHC gene expression in mammals ( Glimcher and Kara, 1992 ), it failed to do so in trout head-kidney macrophages but acted synergistically when combined with LPS ( Knight et al., 1998 ). To conclude, we have studied the MHC class II alpha gene of the gilthead seabream, which possesses all the characteristics and conserved residues to be considered a true MHC class II alpha gene. It is polymorphic and mainly expressed in peritoneal exudate leucocytes, thymus, head-kidney, spleen and gills. The expression of MHC class II alpha has been demonstrated for the first time in acidophilic granulocytes suggesting they may be part of the antigen-presenting cells. Finally, Spau-DAA expression in head-kidney leucocytes is up-regulated by yeast cells and bacteria but is unaffected by ConA, PHA or ConA + LPS.
