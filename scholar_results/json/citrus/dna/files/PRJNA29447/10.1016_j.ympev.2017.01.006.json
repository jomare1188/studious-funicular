          "The well-known avian order Galliformes (chickens, turkey, quail, and allies) comprises 299 extant species ( Gill and Donsker, 2016 ) that exhibit extraordinary diversity in morphology, ecology, and behavior. Previous large-scale studies on galliform phylogeny recovered identical family-level affinities [i.e., (Megapodiidae, (Cracidae, (Numididae, (Odontophoridae, Phasianidae))))] with high bootstrap support (e.g., Crowe et al., 2006; Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ). The most species-rich family, Phasianidae (with 183 species; Gill and Donsker, 2016 ) underwent numerous rapid radiations, and has been the focus of the majority of phylogenetic studies (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball et al., 2011; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Shen et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ). Although substantial progress has been made in resolving phylogenetic history of the Phasianidae, with next-generation sequencing approaches helping to resolve conflicts among previous studies (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Persons et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2014 ; but see Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ), the relationships among several phasianid genera; e.g., the monotypic Ithaginis cruentus (blood pheasant), Lerwa lerwa (snow partridge) and Rhizothera longirostris (long-billed partridge; this is sometimes considered two species; Gill and Donsker, 2016 ), are still not clear. These enigmatic taxa have been sampled for little data and/or they have not been analyzed with an appropriate set of taxa to fully resolve their phylogenetic position.",
          "Ithaginis cruentus is widely distributed in the southern Himalayas, the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau, and the Qinling Mountains of China ( Yang et al., 1994; Zhan et al., 2011 ), where it inhabits high-altitude coniferous or mixed forests and scrub up to 4600 m ( Johnsgard, 1999 ). This sexually dimorphic species is also highly polymorphic, particularly considering male plumage, with nine to fourteen subspecies recognized by various authorities ( Cheng, 1978; Delacour, 1951; Howard and Moore, 1980; Johnsgard, 1999; Madge and McGowan, 2002; Yang et al., 1994 ). Zhan et al. (2011) sampled Ithaginis within China (including 10 subspecies) and identified four major populations, including support for two distinct plumage groups (the red-winged and green-winged blood pheasants; Cheng, 1978; Johnsgard, 1999 ), suggesting deep divergences within this species.",
          "Traditionally, Ithaginis is included in the “Tragopan and allies” group ( Johnsgard, 1986 ) that also includes Tragopan spp. (horned pheasants), Lophophorus spp. (monal pheasants), and Pucrasia macrolopha (koklass pheasant), although many recent studies have found that these taxa do not form a monophyletic group (reviewed by Wang et al., 2013 ). Due to the shared small bill and lanceolate-shaped feathers, Pucrasia macrolopha has been suggested to be its closest relative ( Madge and McGowan, 2002 ). Morphological analyses ( Dyke et al., 2003 ) suggest an alternative placement of the blood pheasant at the base of the major “partridges” and the Odontophoridae, although this result differs from all molecular studies which clearly separate the Odontophoridae from various partridge taxa.",
          "Studies using molecular data have resulted in several different phylogenetic hypotheses for Ithaginis . Crowe et al. (2006) identified it as sister to Gallopheasants (the typical pheasants). Complete mitochondrial sequences ( Meiklejohn et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014 ) suggest Ithaginis is instead basal to the “erectile” clade (a clade including typical pheasants, turkeys, Pucrasia and allies; Kimball and Braun, 2008 ). The basal position of Ithaginis to the erectile clade is also strongly supported by Wang et al. (2013) , which included two mitochondrial regions as well as six nuclear introns. However, a conflicting position occurs with the nuclear data of Shen et al. (2014) that strongly supports Ithaginis as sister to Pucrasia (a position also suggested by Madge and McGowan, 2002 ). The seven nuclear loci used by Shen et al. (2014) included five protein coding genes, and differences between intron and coding data have been observed in birds (e.g., Jarvis et al., 2014 ) which may explain the conflict.",
          "Like Ithaginis , Lerwa also exhibits a high altitude distribution in the Himalayas (from 3000 m to 5500 m, Cheng, 1978 ). As a large-bodied and heavily barred alpine partridge, it has been suggested that this monomorphic species might be an aberrant francolin ( Madge and McGowan, 2002 ). However, its downy chick is remarkably similar to Ithaginis ( Madge and McGowan, 2002; Potapov, 2000 ), whereas its whistling calls and eggs suggest a relationship to another large-bodied, Asian alpine genus, Tetraogallus (snowcocks). However, these attributes may be merely convergent and indicative of a similar lifestyle ( Johnsgard, 1988 ). In the absence of DNA sequence data, Stein et al. (2015) considered Lerwa related to Meleagris (turkey), in part due to their shared species of chewing lice ( Ischnocera ) ( Mey, 2006 ) and the same number of tarsal spurs on adult males ( Davison, 1985 ), which is consistent with the suggestion of Potapov (2000) that Lerwa has no clear systematic affinities within Asia. Only one molecular phylogeny has included Lerwa , which places Lerwa at the base of the erectile clade using 4817 UCE (ultra-conserved element) loci ( Hosner et al., 2016a ). However, that study lacked Ithaginis , and because no previous study has included both Ithaginis and Lerwa , the relationship between them has not been inferred with molecular data (assuming Ithaginis is at or near the base of the erectile clade, as it is in Meiklejohn et al., 2014 and Wang et al., 2013 ).",
          "Rhizothera longirostris , is an elusive, large and sexually dimorphic partridge of tropical forest in the Malayan Peninsula and Greater Sundas. It is typically separated into either two subspecies (e.g., Clements et al., 2015 ) or else two species (e.g., Gill and Donsker, 2016 ): the widespread R. longirostris , and R. dulitensis that is restricted to mountains of central Borneo. The original description of Rhizothera (Temminck 1815, cited in Davison, 1999 ) placed it in the genus Perdix (true partridges). Johnsgard (1988) suggested that it might have evolved from an early Arborophila -like stock (hill partridges), while Crowe and Crowe (1985) suggest possible affinities with Francolinus (francolins). With limited molecular data [∼700 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome b (CYB) sequence], some recent supermatrix analyses have placed Rhizothera sister to Pucrasia macrolopha ( Burleigh et al., 2015; Jetz et al., 2012; Stein et al., 2015 ), though the position of the Rhizothera - Pucrasia clade varies among these studies.",
          "More generally, the position of Pucrasia has varied among previous studies, regardless of the relationship between Pucrasia and Rhizothera . Several studies using nuclear intron or UCE data have supported that Pucrasia is sister to Meleagris and the Tetraoninae (grouse) (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ). However, using complete mitogenomes, Meiklejohn et al. (2014) placed Pucrasia sister to a Perdix -Gallopheasant clade; the mitochondrial data of Wang et al. (2013) also support this position. Given that the phylogenetic position of Pucrasia appears to differ between mitochondrial and nuclear data, it is unclear if the putative relationship between Pucrasia and Rhizothera is also specific to mitochondrial data (since the only data currently available for Rhizothera are mitochondrial), or if it will hold true in nuclear datasets as well.",
          "Having well-resolved phylogenies, that are sampled for major groups, can be important in analyses aimed at understanding trait evolution and biogeographic patterns (e.g., Wang et al., 2017 ), making it important to place unresolved taxa. Therefore, in order to test alternative hypotheses about the position of Ithaginis , Lerwa and Rhizothera , we used 3692 UCE loci (about 1.59 million bp aligned) and mitogenomes from 19 representative galliform species. We selected these taxa to represent hypothesized Ithaginis , Lerwa and Rhizothera sister taxa, as well as all major phasianid clades and outgroups. UCEs are widely distributed throughout genomes, exhibit limited saturation, and are easy to align ( McCormack et al., 2012; Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). Although UCEs are highly conserved across distantly related taxa, their flanking regions contain abundant variations that are capable of resolving shallow-level relationships ( Smith et al., 2014 ) and over short internodes ( Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). Thus they are suitable for a wide variety of questions at varying evolutionary depths (e.g., McCormack et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014; Hosner et al., 2016b ).",
          "Mitochondrial regions often yield conflicting topologies when compared to nuclear data. However, because several previous studies have relied heavily on mitochondrial markers, we also included complete or near-complete mitogenomes for each species. Whole mitogenomes often yield much stronger phylogenetic signal than one or a few mitochondrial genes (e.g., Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ), which may help determine if differing mitochondrial topologies are due to lack of phylogenetic signal or cyto-nuclear discordance. In some cases, we obtained a mitogenome for a species that already had a published mitogenome. Since mitochondrial data are often used to identify deep divergences that may represent distinct species (e.g., Rach et al., 2008 ), we also included these for some analyses to assess whether there may be deep divergences that may warrant further study.",
          "We address the following questions: (1) what is the phylogenetic position of Ithaginis , Lerwa and Rhizothera within the Phasianidae; (2) does increased taxon sampling (inclusion of Rhizothera ) remove the conflict between nuclear and mitochondrial data in the placement of Pucrasia (compare Meiklejohn et al., 2014 to Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ); and (3) for cases when two intraspecific mitogenomes are present, what were the levels of mitogenomic divergence among different individuals within species and are possible cryptic species present?"

In addition to the focal taxa Ithaginis , Lerwa , and Rhizothera (for which we included two samples collected from Myanmar and Borneo), we selected nine species representing the major lineages of the erectile clade. We also included six species from major phasianid lineages outside the erectile clade, and one odontophorid as an outgroup ( Supplementary Material Table A.1 ). The resulting dataset included 20 taxa from 19 species.",
                  "DNA was extracted from toepads of museum specimens for Ithaginis and Rhizothera using the Gentra Puregene® DNA purification kit (Quigen Inc., Valencia CA), following standard manufacturers protocols. The UCE data were prepared by RAPiD Genomics (Gainesville, FL) using a modified approach described by Faircloth et al. (2012) . Illumina TruSeq libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) as modified by Faircloth and Glenn (2012) . Libraries were enriched for 5060 UCE loci targeted by 5472 probes (Mycroarray, Ann Arbor, MI; http://www.mycroarray.com/mybaits/mybaits-UCEs.html ) and PE100 reads were generated using an Illumina (San Diego, CA) HiSeq 2500 lane. We applied Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 ) for reads quality control and used Trinity r20131110 ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ) to assemble the data. Newly collected data was combined with data from Gallus gallus (chicken) that was extracted from published genomes ( Hillier et al., 2004 ), and with data from Sun et al. (2014), Hosner et al. (2016a) and Persons et al. (2016) . We extracted UCE loci from resulting contigs with the PHYLUCE 1.5 pipeline ( Faircloth et al., 2012 ) and aligned them using MAFFT 7 ( Katoh et al., 2002; Katoh and Standley, 2013 ). Raw sequence reads are archived at GenBank under BioProject PRJNA358478.",
                  "Since large amounts of missing data can lead to erroneous phylogenetic estimation in multispecies coalescent frameworks (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Roure et al., 2013 ), only UCE loci sampled for >75% of focal taxa were retained for phylogenetic analysis ( Hosner et al., 2016a ). These alignments were examined by eye in Geneious 6.1.2 (Biomatters Ltd., 2013) and we removed likely assembly or alignment errors at the 5′ or 3′ ends prior to subsequent analyses ( Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). The resulting matrix included 3692 UCE loci with an average length of ∼432 bp and <25% missing data."

Using sequence data collected for this study (or in our previously published studies; Sun et al., 2014; Hosner et al., 2016a; Persons et al., 2016 ), we used read-mapping in Geneious 6.1.2 ( Kearse et al., 2012 ) and the complete chicken mitochondria ( Desjardins and Morais, 1990 ) to assemble mitogenomes that generated 11 new mitogenomic sequences ( Supplementary Material Table A.1 ). Sequences are available at GenBank KY411590-KY411600.",
                  "We combined this with published mitochondrial sequences to either provide a second mitochondrion for some species (six species were represented by two individuals), or for species in which our sequencing efforts resulted in too few mitochondrial reads to assemble a high quality mitochondrial genome ( Supplementary Material Table A.1 ). We used Mesquite 3.04 ( Maddison and Maddison, 2015 ) to check individual protein-coding gene alignments for insertion–deletion events and premature stop codons to ensure the absence of numt sequences. We excluded stop codons and the programmed frameshift in ND3 ( Mindell et al., 1998; Russell and Beckenbach, 2008 ) to generate a final data matrix containing two rRNAs and 13 protein-coding genes with 14,086 bp (20 taxon dataset) or 14,088 bp (25 taxon dataset)."

The partitioning scheme was generated using the rclusterf searching algorithm and AICc criterion for model selection in PartitionFinder 2.0.0-pre11 ( Lanfear et al., 2012 ). We also estimated a multispecies coalescent tree with the UCE data. Due to the problems of gene trees estimated from sequences with few informative sites ( Hosner et al., 2016a; Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ), for this analysis we used the 25% most informative loci ( Hosner et al., 2016a ) resulting in 961 loci (each locus had at least 15 parsimony informative sites). For each locus, we produced one optimal tree and 500 ML bootstrap trees using Garli 2.0 ( Zwickl, 2006 ), implementing the best-fit model for each locus based on the AICc (MrAIC, Nylander, 2004 ). Branches with near zero lengths were treated as polytomies in Garli to accommodate the influence of random resolution of such branch lengths on the construction of species tree ( Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). The bootstrap gene trees as well as the optimal trees were then used as input for reconciliation with ASTRAL 4.10.2 ( Mirarab et al., 2014; Mirarab and Warnow, 2015; Sayyari and Mirarab, 2016 ), which performs well when using the most variable UCEs ( Hosner et al., 2016a; Meiklejohn et al., 2016 )."

The partitioning scheme was generated using the greedy search algorithm and AICc criterion for model selection in PartitionFinder 2.0.0-pre11 ( Lanfear et al., 2012 ). 500 replicate bootstraps were used to assess clade support. Since the use of better-fitting models for mitochondrial data may facilitate the phylogenetic estimation (e.g., Braun and Kimball, 2002; Powell et al., 2013 ), unpartitioned and partitioned ML analyses [the latter with both a DNA model (assigning each partition with the optimal DNA substitution model provided by PartitionFinder) and a DNA + Codon model (DNA model for rRNAs and codon model for the combined 13 protein coding genes, hereafter mixed model)] were also estimated in IQtree 1.4.1 ( Chernomor et al., in press; Minh et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2015 ) for both datasets.

The species tree from ASTRAL also recovered the same topology as the ML tree, although bootstrap support was lower for some nodes ( Fig. 1 ). In particular, Lerwa and Ithaginis formed a grade at the base of the erectile clade; Rhizothera was sister to a large group that includes Pucrasia - Meleagris -Grouse and Perdix -Gallopheasants. Additionally, the non-erectile clade (i.e., chickens and allies, Wang et al., 2013 ) was recovered with 100% support; the position of Haematortyx as sister to Pavo - Argusianus was consistent with other species tree analyses of this clade ( Hosner et al., 2016a; Sun et al., 2014 )."

              "Phylogenetic trees estimated using the mitogenome data differed from the UCE trees in several aspects ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). First, all mitogenomic ML analyses supported a sister relationship between Ithaginis and Lerwa ( Figs. 2 and 3 ); this Ithaginis - Lerwa sister clade was basal to the erectile clade. This was in contrast to the UCE tree where Ithaginis and Lerwa formed a grade at the base of the erectile clade ( Fig. 1 ). Second, Pucrasia was sister to the Perdix -Gallopheasants clade with high support in the mitogenomic trees, in conflict with the UCE tree ( Fig. 1 ). Third, placement of Rhizothera was sensitive to mitogenomic partitioning strategy. In analyses with unpartitioned DNA and using both partitioned DNA and mixed models in IQtree, Rhizothera was sister to the Tetraophasis - Tragopan clade ( Fig. 2 A). However, in partitioned RAxML analyses, Rhizothera was sister to a larger clade including Meleagris , Perdix , Pucrasia and others ( Fig. 2 B), consistent with the UCE data, albeit with lower support ( Fig. 1 ). Finally, there were several differences outside of the erectile clade. For example, the unpartitioned mitogenomic ML tree in RAxML (20-taxa dataset) and IQtree (both 20 and 25-taxa dataset) marginally supported a non-erectile clade ( Fig. 2 A and Supplementary Material tree file ), consistent with the UCE data (and many other analyses of nuclear data; Bonilla et al., 2010; Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ), although species relationships within the non-erectile clade differed from that of the UCE data. However, all other mitogenomic analyses did not recover the non-erectile clade, instead forming a grade (Figs. 2 B and 3 , Supplementary Material tree file ). Regardless, the differences outside the erectile clade were poorly supported in the mitogenomic analyses and were often sensitive to specific analysis (e.g., Figs. 2 and 3 , Supplementary Material tree file ), suggesting that little confidence should be placed on these mitochondrial relationships."

The divergence was 0.01549 for the two individuals in Rhizothera , which is lower than most interspecific distances in birds ( Ward, 2009 ). Thus, it is likely that the individuals of Rhizothera from Myanmar and Borneo sampled for our study might not be sufficiently divergent given that they are ascribed to the same subspecies and do not differ in phenotype. However, the samples of Ithaginis , which is highly polytypic with 12 named subspecies ( Gill and Donsker, 2016 ), exhibited a large mitogenome divergence. Our Ithaginis sample was collected in Nepal, though the published mitogenome (i.e., NC_018033, Zeng et al., 2013 ) does not specify collecting locale. However, the published mitogenome is identical to published control region and cytochrome b sequences of an individual from Yunnan province ( Zhan et al., 2011 ), and thus this sample likely represents a different morphological and genetic group from our sample. These results suggest a more detailed exploration of whether at least some subspecies within Ithaginis should be treated as full species is warranted. Otherwise, other comparisons within species exhibited relatively low mitogenomic divergence, as was expected."

              "In the last decade, molecular phylogenetics, especially the analysis of multilocus datasets, have greatly improved understanding of phasianid relationships (reviewed in Wang et al., 2013 ). However, the phylogenetic positions of certain species have remained unclear. One potential reason for the limited information about relationships of certain taxa is due to the unavailability of fresh tissues from these species. A solution to this problem is the use of specimens from natural history collections in museums, which have been collected over a much longer period of time and cover much greater taxonomic diversity than tissue collections. However, it has been difficult to realize the promise of museums as storehouses of genetic material ( Houde and Braun, 1988; Payne and Sorenson, 2002; Wandeler et al., 2007 ) given the degradation of DNA in most historical samples. Historical samples are valuable and often unique, therefore destructive sampling for genetic analyses may be difficult to justify if DNA degradation makes the likelihood of successful data collection low ( Graves and Braun, 1992 ). However, sequence capture methods now allow for the reliable collection of thousands of loci from older specimens in natural history collections ( Hosner et al., 2016a; McCormack et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2014 ), so it is now much more justifiable to conduct limited destructive sampling of these specimens. Here we were able to place several enigmatic phasianids using thousands of nuclear loci and complete mitogenomes generated by sequence capture with DNA extracted from toepads of museum specimens.",
              "Our analyses of UCE data recovered similar relationship among phasianids as previous studies using multi-locus datasets. In general, all analyses (concatenated gene tree and species tree) based on UCE data recovered the same topology, and found the erectile and non-erectile clades with 100% support. However, within those clades the species tree showed low support for some relationships ( Fig. 1 ). Although multispecies coalescent methods represent a valuable paradigm in phylogenetics ( Edwards et al., 2016 ), it is also known that coalescent species trees based on gene tree summation may not always perform significantly better than concatenation methods ( Patel et al., 2013; Tonini et al., 2015 ), and lower support for many relationships in species trees is typical (e.g., Lambert et al., 2015 ).",
              "In contrast with the analyses of nuclear data by Shen et al. (2014) , our UCE data instead agree with the nuclear intron data of Wang et al. (2013) in placing Ithaginis at the base of the erectile clade, as also occurs when using complete mitochondrial genome sequences ( Figs. 2 and 3 ; Bao et al., 2010; Meiklejohn et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, we resolved the relative positions of Ithaginis and another poorly known taxa, Lerwa , which form a grade at the base of the erectile clade. These are both heavy bodied, alpine species, though Ithaginis is strongly sexually dimorphic, while Lerwa is monomorphic. The suggestion that Lerwa is not clearly related to other Asian taxa ( Potapov, 2000 ) might be interpreted as excluding a sister relationship with Ithaginis .",
              "Finally, in contrast with studies analyzing a small region of mitochondrial data (e.g., Burleigh et al., 2015; Jetz et al., 2012; Stein et al., 2015 ), our results confidently place Rhizothera at the base of a larger clade that includes Pucrasia as well as a number of other taxa, although this position was not universally supported in mitogenome analyses."

              "Cyto-nuclear discordance is common, though determining its causes can be difficult ( Toews and Brelsford, 2012 ). Among the differences between the topologies of the UCE and mitogenome data, many were outside the erectile clade. Whether the non-erectile group forms a clade or a grade has been difficult to establish, as have relationships within the non-erectile clade (e.g., Crowe et al., 2006; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ). This appears to be due to rapid radiation and short internodes among these problematic groups and the weak power to resolve their relationships based on smaller data sets. This may be why the mitogenomes, which have fewer variable sites and higher homoplasy than UCEs ( Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ), exhibited low bootstrap support and differences when compared with the UCEs outside of the erectile clade. Given the lower support for these relationships using the mitogenome (as well as the more limited taxon sampling outside of the erectile clade), congruence with the UCEs cannot be rejected for the non-erectile clade.",
              "However, there were two relationships in the erectile clade that did exhibit well-supported and consistent conflict between the UCEs and the mitogenome - the placement of Pucrasia and the relationship between Ithaginis and Lerwa . While no previous molecular study has included both Ithaginis and Lerwa , previous molecular studies have identified three major hypotheses for the position of Pucrasia : (1) within “ Tragopan and allies” ( Crowe et al., 2006; Eo et al., 2009; Lucchini and Randi, 1999 ), (2) sister to turkey-grouse ( Hosner et al., 2016a; Wang et al., 2013 ), and (3) sister to Perdix -Gallopheasant ( Bao et al., 2010; Kimball et al., 2011; Kimball and Braun, 2008; Meiklejohn et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2010 ). This last hypothesis appears to be driven by signal in the mitochondrial genome ( Wang et al., 2013 ) as we also found here.",
              "For discordance among deeply diverged taxa, such as observed here, there are several possible causes. First, phylogenetic mis-estimation of either the mitochondrial or nuclear phylogeny (or both) may have occurred, such that the discordance is in the estimate(s) of phylogeny not in the underlying data. To obtain the best estimate of the mitochondrial phylogeny it is important to use complete mitogenomes ( Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ) due to the existence of conflict among estimates of phylogeny from different mitochondrial regions ( Cox et al., 2007 ) and/or the low power of individual mitochondrial regions. However, analyses of mitochondrial data can be sensitive to model parameters (e.g., Braun and Kimball, 2002; Meiklejohn et al., 2014; Phillips et al., 2010; Powell et al., 2013 ). In the current study, we applied both DNA and codon models for protein coding regions in our mitogenome analyses, and also tried different programs (RAxML vs IQtree). Use of putatively better models (partitioning or codon models) did not resolve most conflicts between the mitochondrial and UCE data, although partitioning did result in agreement between the mitogenome and UCE data for Rhizothera . However, we note that the use of models that better accommodate the patterns of molecular evolution does not always result in the recovery of historical signal; this is certainly true for complete mitogenomes (e.g., Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ).",
              "Improved taxon sampling can also improve phylogenetic estimation. Since several large-scale studies ( Jetz et al., 2012; Burleigh et al., 2015; Stein et al., 2015 ) found a sister relationship between Rhizothera and Pucrasia , we hypothesized that the inclusion of Rhizothera might stabilize the position of Pucrasia given that even adding a single taxon that diverges close to an unresolved node of interest should facilitate phylogenetic resolution ( Townsend and Lopez-Giraldez, 2010 ). However, the current study does not support the previous molecular hypotheses regarding Rhizothera and the position of Pucrasia still depends upon data type. Thus, while including more taxa to break long branches may be necessary to resolve some uncertainties, our inclusion of more taxa likely to affect the relationship of Pucrasia did not resolve conflicts in this instance (see also Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ).",
              "Other causes of discordance can be due to incomplete lineage sorting or hybridization. We explored these two possibilities by reducing the UCE gene trees into rooted three taxon trees and examining the percentage of each topology. Under this condition, discordance due to the multispecies coalescent is expected to yield a majority topology and two equiprobable minority topologies, while hybridization would be expected to lead to a majority topology and asymmetric minority topologies. For Pucrasia , we trimmed branches of the gene trees to only include Pucrasia , Syrmaticus , Lagopus , and Rhynchortyx (the last of which was used as the root). The most common gene tree did match the UCE topology (sister to turkey and grouse; 29.6% of trees) and support for the other two alternative topologies was equal (17.7 and 17.6%); the remaining 35% of gene trees were unresolved. For Lerwa , the rooted three taxon trees contained Lerwa , Ithaginis , Syrmaticus and rooted to Rhynchortyx . Again, we also found the UCE topology was most common (45.5% of trees), while the two alternative topologies were found in roughly equal proportions (15.9 and 15.0%; the remaining 23.6% of gene trees were unresolved). Thus, in both of these cases we have results consistent with lineage sorting, and inconsistent with hybridization.",
              "One other explanation for discordance is due to selection that may drive convergence. Both Ithaginis and Lerwa are distributed at high altitudes, and it is possible that their mitogenomes have convergent adaptions to cold temperatures and lower partial pressures of oxygen. However, we did not identify any amino acid substitutions unique to both Ithaginis and Lerwa that would suggest convergence. Additionally, it is not clear what selective factor could drive the position of Pucrasia , and a simpler explanation for both cases may be that of incomplete lineage sorting.",
              "Even if incomplete lineage sorting does explain the differences between the UCE and mitogenome topologies, we feel the robust relationship given by UCE data should be considered as the likely species tree. This is in part due to the observation that analyses that incorporated the multispecies coalescent supported the UCE topology, suggesting neither conflicting relationship is in the anomaly zone ( Degnan and Rosenberg, 2006; Liu and Edwards, 2009 ). Since mitochondrial genomes typically do not undergo recombination (e.g., Berlin and Ellegren, 2001; Berlin et al., 2004 ; but see Sammler et al., 2011 ), the mitogenome represents only a single locus whereas the large number of UCE loci provided a genome-wide sample of many different genes. Moreover, modeling the rapidly evolving mitogenome data is more challenging than that of nuclear data (different models return different results as shown in the current study; see also Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ). Additionally, UCEs exhibit much less homoplasy than mitochondrial data ( McCormack et al., 2012; Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). Thus, while understanding factors that may drive nuclear-mitochondrial differences may be of continued interest, our UCE data has likely provided an answer to the phylogenetic position of the phasianid taxa examined here."

              "Of the six species where mitogenomes were available from two individuals, at least one of them demonstrated substantial divergence that could represent cryptic species ( Ithaginis ). With the exception of the two Rhizothera samples, no attempt was made to sample individuals from different populations (in those five cases, one mitogenome was published and one was collected through our sequence capture). Thus, there may be additional cases within species we examined where more strategic geographic sampling could have resulted in identification of deep divergences. The single case of deep divergence occurred in a highly polymorphic species, whereas in the other five species in which we examined the mitochondria showed little or no polymorphism across their species range. Deep mitogenomic divergence alone is insufficient to split a named species but the observation of this divergence in a polytypic species is suggestive. However, it is important to note that there are a number of highly polymorphic species that also have relatively large numbers of defined subspecies within the Phasianidae overall. If these other species are like Ithaginis and show deep divergences, there may be many more species in the Phasianidae than are currently recognized."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction The well-known avian order Galliformes (chickens, turkey, quail, and allies) comprises 299 extant species ( Gill and Donsker, 2016 ) that exhibit extraordinary diversity in morphology, ecology, and behavior. Previous large-scale studies on galliform phylogeny recovered identical family-level affinities [i.e., (Megapodiidae, (Cracidae, (Numididae, (Odontophoridae, Phasianidae))))] with high bootstrap support (e.g., Crowe et al., 2006; Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ). The most species-rich family, Phasianidae (with 183 species; Gill and Donsker, 2016 ) underwent numerous rapid radiations, and has been the focus of the majority of phylogenetic studies (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball et al., 2011; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Shen et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ). Although substantial progress has been made in resolving phylogenetic history of the Phasianidae, with next-generation sequencing approaches helping to resolve conflicts among previous studies (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Persons et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2014 ; but see Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ), the relationships among several phasianid genera; e.g., the monotypic Ithaginis cruentus (blood pheasant), Lerwa lerwa (snow partridge) and Rhizothera longirostris (long-billed partridge; this is sometimes considered two species; Gill and Donsker, 2016 ), are still not clear. These enigmatic taxa have been sampled for little data and/or they have not been analyzed with an appropriate set of taxa to fully resolve their phylogenetic position. Ithaginis cruentus is widely distributed in the southern Himalayas, the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau, and the Qinling Mountains of China ( Yang et al., 1994; Zhan et al., 2011 ), where it inhabits high-altitude coniferous or mixed forests and scrub up to 4600 m ( Johnsgard, 1999 ). This sexually dimorphic species is also highly polymorphic, particularly considering male plumage, with nine to fourteen subspecies recognized by various authorities ( Cheng, 1978; Delacour, 1951; Howard and Moore, 1980; Johnsgard, 1999; Madge and McGowan, 2002; Yang et al., 1994 ). Zhan et al. (2011) sampled Ithaginis within China (including 10 subspecies) and identified four major populations, including support for two distinct plumage groups (the red-winged and green-winged blood pheasants; Cheng, 1978; Johnsgard, 1999 ), suggesting deep divergences within this species. Traditionally, Ithaginis is included in the “Tragopan and allies” group ( Johnsgard, 1986 ) that also includes Tragopan spp. (horned pheasants), Lophophorus spp. (monal pheasants), and Pucrasia macrolopha (koklass pheasant), although many recent studies have found that these taxa do not form a monophyletic group (reviewed by Wang et al., 2013 ). Due to the shared small bill and lanceolate-shaped feathers, Pucrasia macrolopha has been suggested to be its closest relative ( Madge and McGowan, 2002 ). Morphological analyses ( Dyke et al., 2003 ) suggest an alternative placement of the blood pheasant at the base of the major “partridges” and the Odontophoridae, although this result differs from all molecular studies which clearly separate the Odontophoridae from various partridge taxa. Studies using molecular data have resulted in several different phylogenetic hypotheses for Ithaginis . Crowe et al. (2006) identified it as sister to Gallopheasants (the typical pheasants). Complete mitochondrial sequences ( Meiklejohn et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014 ) suggest Ithaginis is instead basal to the “erectile” clade (a clade including typical pheasants, turkeys, Pucrasia and allies; Kimball and Braun, 2008 ). The basal position of Ithaginis to the erectile clade is also strongly supported by Wang et al. (2013) , which included two mitochondrial regions as well as six nuclear introns. However, a conflicting position occurs with the nuclear data of Shen et al. (2014) that strongly supports Ithaginis as sister to Pucrasia (a position also suggested by Madge and McGowan, 2002 ). The seven nuclear loci used by Shen et al. (2014) included five protein coding genes, and differences between intron and coding data have been observed in birds (e.g., Jarvis et al., 2014 ) which may explain the conflict. Like Ithaginis , Lerwa also exhibits a high altitude distribution in the Himalayas (from 3000 m to 5500 m, Cheng, 1978 ). As a large-bodied and heavily barred alpine partridge, it has been suggested that this monomorphic species might be an aberrant francolin ( Madge and McGowan, 2002 ). However, its downy chick is remarkably similar to Ithaginis ( Madge and McGowan, 2002; Potapov, 2000 ), whereas its whistling calls and eggs suggest a relationship to another large-bodied, Asian alpine genus, Tetraogallus (snowcocks). However, these attributes may be merely convergent and indicative of a similar lifestyle ( Johnsgard, 1988 ). In the absence of DNA sequence data, Stein et al. (2015) considered Lerwa related to Meleagris (turkey), in part due to their shared species of chewing lice ( Ischnocera ) ( Mey, 2006 ) and the same number of tarsal spurs on adult males ( Davison, 1985 ), which is consistent with the suggestion of Potapov (2000) that Lerwa has no clear systematic affinities within Asia. Only one molecular phylogeny has included Lerwa , which places Lerwa at the base of the erectile clade using 4817 UCE (ultra-conserved element) loci ( Hosner et al., 2016a ). However, that study lacked Ithaginis , and because no previous study has included both Ithaginis and Lerwa , the relationship between them has not been inferred with molecular data (assuming Ithaginis is at or near the base of the erectile clade, as it is in Meiklejohn et al., 2014 and Wang et al., 2013 ). Rhizothera longirostris , is an elusive, large and sexually dimorphic partridge of tropical forest in the Malayan Peninsula and Greater Sundas. It is typically separated into either two subspecies (e.g., Clements et al., 2015 ) or else two species (e.g., Gill and Donsker, 2016 ): the widespread R. longirostris , and R. dulitensis that is restricted to mountains of central Borneo. The original description of Rhizothera (Temminck 1815, cited in Davison, 1999 ) placed it in the genus Perdix (true partridges). Johnsgard (1988) suggested that it might have evolved from an early Arborophila -like stock (hill partridges), while Crowe and Crowe (1985) suggest possible affinities with Francolinus (francolins). With limited molecular data [∼700 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome b (CYB) sequence], some recent supermatrix analyses have placed Rhizothera sister to Pucrasia macrolopha ( Burleigh et al., 2015; Jetz et al., 2012; Stein et al., 2015 ), though the position of the Rhizothera - Pucrasia clade varies among these studies. More generally, the position of Pucrasia has varied among previous studies, regardless of the relationship between Pucrasia and Rhizothera . Several studies using nuclear intron or UCE data have supported that Pucrasia is sister to Meleagris and the Tetraoninae (grouse) (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ). However, using complete mitogenomes, Meiklejohn et al. (2014) placed Pucrasia sister to a Perdix -Gallopheasant clade; the mitochondrial data of Wang et al. (2013) also support this position. Given that the phylogenetic position of Pucrasia appears to differ between mitochondrial and nuclear data, it is unclear if the putative relationship between Pucrasia and Rhizothera is also specific to mitochondrial data (since the only data currently available for Rhizothera are mitochondrial), or if it will hold true in nuclear datasets as well. Having well-resolved phylogenies, that are sampled for major groups, can be important in analyses aimed at understanding trait evolution and biogeographic patterns (e.g., Wang et al., 2017 ), making it important to place unresolved taxa. Therefore, in order to test alternative hypotheses about the position of Ithaginis , Lerwa and Rhizothera , we used 3692 UCE loci (about 1.59 million bp aligned) and mitogenomes from 19 representative galliform species. We selected these taxa to represent hypothesized Ithaginis , Lerwa and Rhizothera sister taxa, as well as all major phasianid clades and outgroups. UCEs are widely distributed throughout genomes, exhibit limited saturation, and are easy to align ( McCormack et al., 2012; Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). Although UCEs are highly conserved across distantly related taxa, their flanking regions contain abundant variations that are capable of resolving shallow-level relationships ( Smith et al., 2014 ) and over short internodes ( Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). Thus they are suitable for a wide variety of questions at varying evolutionary depths (e.g., McCormack et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014; Hosner et al., 2016b ). Mitochondrial regions often yield conflicting topologies when compared to nuclear data. However, because several previous studies have relied heavily on mitochondrial markers, we also included complete or near-complete mitogenomes for each species. Whole mitogenomes often yield much stronger phylogenetic signal than one or a few mitochondrial genes (e.g., Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ), which may help determine if differing mitochondrial topologies are due to lack of phylogenetic signal or cyto-nuclear discordance. In some cases, we obtained a mitogenome for a species that already had a published mitogenome. Since mitochondrial data are often used to identify deep divergences that may represent distinct species (e.g., Rach et al., 2008 ), we also included these for some analyses to assess whether there may be deep divergences that may warrant further study. We address the following questions: (1) what is the phylogenetic position of Ithaginis , Lerwa and Rhizothera within the Phasianidae; (2) does increased taxon sampling (inclusion of Rhizothera ) remove the conflict between nuclear and mitochondrial data in the placement of Pucrasia (compare Meiklejohn et al., 2014 to Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ); and (3) for cases when two intraspecific mitogenomes are present, what were the levels of mitogenomic divergence among different individuals within species and are possible cryptic species present? 2 Methods 2.1 Collection of sequence data 2.1.1 Ultra-conserved element data Previous studies suggest that Rhizothera is within the erectile clade, and that Lerwa and Ithaginis are at the base of the erectile clade or within the erectile clade (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Shen et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ), thus we focused taxon sampling within that group. In addition to the focal taxa Ithaginis , Lerwa , and Rhizothera (for which we included two samples collected from Myanmar and Borneo), we selected nine species representing the major lineages of the erectile clade. We also included six species from major phasianid lineages outside the erectile clade, and one odontophorid as an outgroup ( Supplementary Material Table A.1 ). The resulting dataset included 20 taxa from 19 species. DNA was extracted from toepads of museum specimens for Ithaginis and Rhizothera using the Gentra Puregene® DNA purification kit (Quigen Inc., Valencia CA), following standard manufacturers protocols. The UCE data were prepared by RAPiD Genomics (Gainesville, FL) using a modified approach described by Faircloth et al. (2012) . Illumina TruSeq libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) as modified by Faircloth and Glenn (2012) . Libraries were enriched for 5060 UCE loci targeted by 5472 probes (Mycroarray, Ann Arbor, MI; http://www.mycroarray.com/mybaits/mybaits-UCEs.html ) and PE100 reads were generated using an Illumina (San Diego, CA) HiSeq 2500 lane. We applied Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 ) for reads quality control and used Trinity r20131110 ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ) to assemble the data. Newly collected data was combined with data from Gallus gallus (chicken) that was extracted from published genomes ( Hillier et al., 2004 ), and with data from Sun et al. (2014), Hosner et al. (2016a) and Persons et al. (2016) . We extracted UCE loci from resulting contigs with the PHYLUCE 1.5 pipeline ( Faircloth et al., 2012 ) and aligned them using MAFFT 7 ( Katoh et al., 2002; Katoh and Standley, 2013 ). Raw sequence reads are archived at GenBank under BioProject PRJNA358478. Since large amounts of missing data can lead to erroneous phylogenetic estimation in multispecies coalescent frameworks (e.g., Hosner et al., 2016a; Roure et al., 2013 ), only UCE loci sampled for >75% of focal taxa were retained for phylogenetic analysis ( Hosner et al., 2016a ). These alignments were examined by eye in Geneious 6.1.2 (Biomatters Ltd., 2013) and we removed likely assembly or alignment errors at the 5′ or 3′ ends prior to subsequent analyses ( Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). The resulting matrix included 3692 UCE loci with an average length of ∼432 bp and <25% missing data. 2.1.2 Mitogenome data Although the libraries used for UCE sequencing were enriched for UCEs, in some cases substantial numbers of mitochondrial sequences were also obtained (particularly when DNA was extracted from mitochondrially-enriched tissues). Using sequence data collected for this study (or in our previously published studies; Sun et al., 2014; Hosner et al., 2016a; Persons et al., 2016 ), we used read-mapping in Geneious 6.1.2 ( Kearse et al., 2012 ) and the complete chicken mitochondria ( Desjardins and Morais, 1990 ) to assemble mitogenomes that generated 11 new mitogenomic sequences ( Supplementary Material Table A.1 ). Sequences are available at GenBank KY411590-KY411600. We combined this with published mitochondrial sequences to either provide a second mitochondrion for some species (six species were represented by two individuals), or for species in which our sequencing efforts resulted in too few mitochondrial reads to assemble a high quality mitochondrial genome ( Supplementary Material Table A.1 ). We used Mesquite 3.04 ( Maddison and Maddison, 2015 ) to check individual protein-coding gene alignments for insertion–deletion events and premature stop codons to ensure the absence of numt sequences. We excluded stop codons and the programmed frameshift in ND3 ( Mindell et al., 1998; Russell and Beckenbach, 2008 ) to generate a final data matrix containing two rRNAs and 13 protein-coding genes with 14,086 bp (20 taxon dataset) or 14,088 bp (25 taxon dataset). 2.2 Phylogenomic analyses 2.2.1 Ultra-conserved element data We conducted unpartitioned and partitioned ML analyses of the concatenated UCE alignment in RAxML 8.2.3 ( Stamatakis, 2014 ) with the GTRGAMMA model and assessed support using 500 ML bootstrap replicates. The partitioning scheme was generated using the rclusterf searching algorithm and AICc criterion for model selection in PartitionFinder 2.0.0-pre11 ( Lanfear et al., 2012 ). We also estimated a multispecies coalescent tree with the UCE data. Due to the problems of gene trees estimated from sequences with few informative sites ( Hosner et al., 2016a; Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ), for this analysis we used the 25% most informative loci ( Hosner et al., 2016a ) resulting in 961 loci (each locus had at least 15 parsimony informative sites). For each locus, we produced one optimal tree and 500 ML bootstrap trees using Garli 2.0 ( Zwickl, 2006 ), implementing the best-fit model for each locus based on the AICc (MrAIC, Nylander, 2004 ). Branches with near zero lengths were treated as polytomies in Garli to accommodate the influence of random resolution of such branch lengths on the construction of species tree ( Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). The bootstrap gene trees as well as the optimal trees were then used as input for reconciliation with ASTRAL 4.10.2 ( Mirarab et al., 2014; Mirarab and Warnow, 2015; Sayyari and Mirarab, 2016 ), which performs well when using the most variable UCEs ( Hosner et al., 2016a; Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). 2.2.2 Mitogenome data We conducted unpartitioned and partitioned ML analyses in RAxML 8.0.2 ( Stamatakis, 2014 ) under the GTRGAMMA model using a complete data matrix (25 taxa, with duplicate mitogenomes for some species) and a reduced data matrix (20 taxa, with one representative to match each of the taxa sampled for UCEs). The partitioning scheme was generated using the greedy search algorithm and AICc criterion for model selection in PartitionFinder 2.0.0-pre11 ( Lanfear et al., 2012 ). 500 replicate bootstraps were used to assess clade support. Since the use of better-fitting models for mitochondrial data may facilitate the phylogenetic estimation (e.g., Braun and Kimball, 2002; Powell et al., 2013 ), unpartitioned and partitioned ML analyses [the latter with both a DNA model (assigning each partition with the optimal DNA substitution model provided by PartitionFinder) and a DNA + Codon model (DNA model for rRNAs and codon model for the combined 13 protein coding genes, hereafter mixed model)] were also estimated in IQtree 1.4.1 ( Chernomor et al., in press; Minh et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2015 ) for both datasets. We assessed the divergence within species using uncorrected p -distances calculated in PAUP∗4.0b10 ( Swofford, 2003 ). 3 Results 3.1 Relationships of enigmatic taxa Our concatenated analyses of the UCE data resulted in a completely resolved phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 1 ). Both unpartitioned and partitioned maximum likelihood analyses recovered identical topologies, with all clades obtaining 100% bootstrap support. The species tree from ASTRAL also recovered the same topology as the ML tree, although bootstrap support was lower for some nodes ( Fig. 1 ). In particular, Lerwa and Ithaginis formed a grade at the base of the erectile clade; Rhizothera was sister to a large group that includes Pucrasia - Meleagris -Grouse and Perdix -Gallopheasants. Additionally, the non-erectile clade (i.e., chickens and allies, Wang et al., 2013 ) was recovered with 100% support; the position of Haematortyx as sister to Pavo - Argusianus was consistent with other species tree analyses of this clade ( Hosner et al., 2016a; Sun et al., 2014 ). 3.2 Mitochondrial-nuclear conflicts Phylogenetic trees estimated using the mitogenome data differed from the UCE trees in several aspects ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). First, all mitogenomic ML analyses supported a sister relationship between Ithaginis and Lerwa ( Figs. 2 and 3 ); this Ithaginis - Lerwa sister clade was basal to the erectile clade. This was in contrast to the UCE tree where Ithaginis and Lerwa formed a grade at the base of the erectile clade ( Fig. 1 ). Second, Pucrasia was sister to the Perdix -Gallopheasants clade with high support in the mitogenomic trees, in conflict with the UCE tree ( Fig. 1 ). Third, placement of Rhizothera was sensitive to mitogenomic partitioning strategy. In analyses with unpartitioned DNA and using both partitioned DNA and mixed models in IQtree, Rhizothera was sister to the Tetraophasis - Tragopan clade ( Fig. 2 A). However, in partitioned RAxML analyses, Rhizothera was sister to a larger clade including Meleagris , Perdix , Pucrasia and others ( Fig. 2 B), consistent with the UCE data, albeit with lower support ( Fig. 1 ). Finally, there were several differences outside of the erectile clade. For example, the unpartitioned mitogenomic ML tree in RAxML (20-taxa dataset) and IQtree (both 20 and 25-taxa dataset) marginally supported a non-erectile clade ( Fig. 2 A and Supplementary Material tree file ), consistent with the UCE data (and many other analyses of nuclear data; Bonilla et al., 2010; Hosner et al., 2016a; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ), although species relationships within the non-erectile clade differed from that of the UCE data. However, all other mitogenomic analyses did not recover the non-erectile clade, instead forming a grade (Figs. 2 B and 3 , Supplementary Material tree file ). Regardless, the differences outside the erectile clade were poorly supported in the mitogenomic analyses and were often sensitive to specific analysis (e.g., Figs. 2 and 3 , Supplementary Material tree file ), suggesting that little confidence should be placed on these mitochondrial relationships. 3.3 Levels of mitogenome divergence within different species Using five additional mitogenome sequences, the divergence (uncorrected p distances) between individuals within species ranged from 0.00086 ( Perdix ) to 0.03024 ( Ithaginis ) ( Table 1 ). The divergence was 0.01549 for the two individuals in Rhizothera , which is lower than most interspecific distances in birds ( Ward, 2009 ). Thus, it is likely that the individuals of Rhizothera from Myanmar and Borneo sampled for our study might not be sufficiently divergent given that they are ascribed to the same subspecies and do not differ in phenotype. However, the samples of Ithaginis , which is highly polytypic with 12 named subspecies ( Gill and Donsker, 2016 ), exhibited a large mitogenome divergence. Our Ithaginis sample was collected in Nepal, though the published mitogenome (i.e., NC_018033, Zeng et al., 2013 ) does not specify collecting locale. However, the published mitogenome is identical to published control region and cytochrome b sequences of an individual from Yunnan province ( Zhan et al., 2011 ), and thus this sample likely represents a different morphological and genetic group from our sample. These results suggest a more detailed exploration of whether at least some subspecies within Ithaginis should be treated as full species is warranted. Otherwise, other comparisons within species exhibited relatively low mitogenomic divergence, as was expected. 4 Discussion 4.1 Phylogenomics place three enigmatic phasianid genera In the last decade, molecular phylogenetics, especially the analysis of multilocus datasets, have greatly improved understanding of phasianid relationships (reviewed in Wang et al., 2013 ). However, the phylogenetic positions of certain species have remained unclear. One potential reason for the limited information about relationships of certain taxa is due to the unavailability of fresh tissues from these species. A solution to this problem is the use of specimens from natural history collections in museums, which have been collected over a much longer period of time and cover much greater taxonomic diversity than tissue collections. However, it has been difficult to realize the promise of museums as storehouses of genetic material ( Houde and Braun, 1988; Payne and Sorenson, 2002; Wandeler et al., 2007 ) given the degradation of DNA in most historical samples. Historical samples are valuable and often unique, therefore destructive sampling for genetic analyses may be difficult to justify if DNA degradation makes the likelihood of successful data collection low ( Graves and Braun, 1992 ). However, sequence capture methods now allow for the reliable collection of thousands of loci from older specimens in natural history collections ( Hosner et al., 2016a; McCormack et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2014 ), so it is now much more justifiable to conduct limited destructive sampling of these specimens. Here we were able to place several enigmatic phasianids using thousands of nuclear loci and complete mitogenomes generated by sequence capture with DNA extracted from toepads of museum specimens. Our analyses of UCE data recovered similar relationship among phasianids as previous studies using multi-locus datasets. In general, all analyses (concatenated gene tree and species tree) based on UCE data recovered the same topology, and found the erectile and non-erectile clades with 100% support. However, within those clades the species tree showed low support for some relationships ( Fig. 1 ). Although multispecies coalescent methods represent a valuable paradigm in phylogenetics ( Edwards et al., 2016 ), it is also known that coalescent species trees based on gene tree summation may not always perform significantly better than concatenation methods ( Patel et al., 2013; Tonini et al., 2015 ), and lower support for many relationships in species trees is typical (e.g., Lambert et al., 2015 ). In contrast with the analyses of nuclear data by Shen et al. (2014) , our UCE data instead agree with the nuclear intron data of Wang et al. (2013) in placing Ithaginis at the base of the erectile clade, as also occurs when using complete mitochondrial genome sequences ( Figs. 2 and 3 ; Bao et al., 2010; Meiklejohn et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, we resolved the relative positions of Ithaginis and another poorly known taxa, Lerwa , which form a grade at the base of the erectile clade. These are both heavy bodied, alpine species, though Ithaginis is strongly sexually dimorphic, while Lerwa is monomorphic. The suggestion that Lerwa is not clearly related to other Asian taxa ( Potapov, 2000 ) might be interpreted as excluding a sister relationship with Ithaginis . Finally, in contrast with studies analyzing a small region of mitochondrial data (e.g., Burleigh et al., 2015; Jetz et al., 2012; Stein et al., 2015 ), our results confidently place Rhizothera at the base of a larger clade that includes Pucrasia as well as a number of other taxa, although this position was not universally supported in mitogenome analyses. 4.2 Mitochondrial-nuclear conflicts Cyto-nuclear discordance is common, though determining its causes can be difficult ( Toews and Brelsford, 2012 ). Among the differences between the topologies of the UCE and mitogenome data, many were outside the erectile clade. Whether the non-erectile group forms a clade or a grade has been difficult to establish, as have relationships within the non-erectile clade (e.g., Crowe et al., 2006; Kimball and Braun, 2014; Wang et al., 2013 ). This appears to be due to rapid radiation and short internodes among these problematic groups and the weak power to resolve their relationships based on smaller data sets. This may be why the mitogenomes, which have fewer variable sites and higher homoplasy than UCEs ( Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ), exhibited low bootstrap support and differences when compared with the UCEs outside of the erectile clade. Given the lower support for these relationships using the mitogenome (as well as the more limited taxon sampling outside of the erectile clade), congruence with the UCEs cannot be rejected for the non-erectile clade. However, there were two relationships in the erectile clade that did exhibit well-supported and consistent conflict between the UCEs and the mitogenome - the placement of Pucrasia and the relationship between Ithaginis and Lerwa . While no previous molecular study has included both Ithaginis and Lerwa , previous molecular studies have identified three major hypotheses for the position of Pucrasia : (1) within “ Tragopan and allies” ( Crowe et al., 2006; Eo et al., 2009; Lucchini and Randi, 1999 ), (2) sister to turkey-grouse ( Hosner et al., 2016a; Wang et al., 2013 ), and (3) sister to Perdix -Gallopheasant ( Bao et al., 2010; Kimball et al., 2011; Kimball and Braun, 2008; Meiklejohn et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2010 ). This last hypothesis appears to be driven by signal in the mitochondrial genome ( Wang et al., 2013 ) as we also found here. For discordance among deeply diverged taxa, such as observed here, there are several possible causes. First, phylogenetic mis-estimation of either the mitochondrial or nuclear phylogeny (or both) may have occurred, such that the discordance is in the estimate(s) of phylogeny not in the underlying data. To obtain the best estimate of the mitochondrial phylogeny it is important to use complete mitogenomes ( Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ) due to the existence of conflict among estimates of phylogeny from different mitochondrial regions ( Cox et al., 2007 ) and/or the low power of individual mitochondrial regions. However, analyses of mitochondrial data can be sensitive to model parameters (e.g., Braun and Kimball, 2002; Meiklejohn et al., 2014; Phillips et al., 2010; Powell et al., 2013 ). In the current study, we applied both DNA and codon models for protein coding regions in our mitogenome analyses, and also tried different programs (RAxML vs IQtree). Use of putatively better models (partitioning or codon models) did not resolve most conflicts between the mitochondrial and UCE data, although partitioning did result in agreement between the mitogenome and UCE data for Rhizothera . However, we note that the use of models that better accommodate the patterns of molecular evolution does not always result in the recovery of historical signal; this is certainly true for complete mitogenomes (e.g., Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ). Improved taxon sampling can also improve phylogenetic estimation. Since several large-scale studies ( Jetz et al., 2012; Burleigh et al., 2015; Stein et al., 2015 ) found a sister relationship between Rhizothera and Pucrasia , we hypothesized that the inclusion of Rhizothera might stabilize the position of Pucrasia given that even adding a single taxon that diverges close to an unresolved node of interest should facilitate phylogenetic resolution ( Townsend and Lopez-Giraldez, 2010 ). However, the current study does not support the previous molecular hypotheses regarding Rhizothera and the position of Pucrasia still depends upon data type. Thus, while including more taxa to break long branches may be necessary to resolve some uncertainties, our inclusion of more taxa likely to affect the relationship of Pucrasia did not resolve conflicts in this instance (see also Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ). Other causes of discordance can be due to incomplete lineage sorting or hybridization. We explored these two possibilities by reducing the UCE gene trees into rooted three taxon trees and examining the percentage of each topology. Under this condition, discordance due to the multispecies coalescent is expected to yield a majority topology and two equiprobable minority topologies, while hybridization would be expected to lead to a majority topology and asymmetric minority topologies. For Pucrasia , we trimmed branches of the gene trees to only include Pucrasia , Syrmaticus , Lagopus , and Rhynchortyx (the last of which was used as the root). The most common gene tree did match the UCE topology (sister to turkey and grouse; 29.6% of trees) and support for the other two alternative topologies was equal (17.7 and 17.6%); the remaining 35% of gene trees were unresolved. For Lerwa , the rooted three taxon trees contained Lerwa , Ithaginis , Syrmaticus and rooted to Rhynchortyx . Again, we also found the UCE topology was most common (45.5% of trees), while the two alternative topologies were found in roughly equal proportions (15.9 and 15.0%; the remaining 23.6% of gene trees were unresolved). Thus, in both of these cases we have results consistent with lineage sorting, and inconsistent with hybridization. One other explanation for discordance is due to selection that may drive convergence. Both Ithaginis and Lerwa are distributed at high altitudes, and it is possible that their mitogenomes have convergent adaptions to cold temperatures and lower partial pressures of oxygen. However, we did not identify any amino acid substitutions unique to both Ithaginis and Lerwa that would suggest convergence. Additionally, it is not clear what selective factor could drive the position of Pucrasia , and a simpler explanation for both cases may be that of incomplete lineage sorting. Even if incomplete lineage sorting does explain the differences between the UCE and mitogenome topologies, we feel the robust relationship given by UCE data should be considered as the likely species tree. This is in part due to the observation that analyses that incorporated the multispecies coalescent supported the UCE topology, suggesting neither conflicting relationship is in the anomaly zone ( Degnan and Rosenberg, 2006; Liu and Edwards, 2009 ). Since mitochondrial genomes typically do not undergo recombination (e.g., Berlin and Ellegren, 2001; Berlin et al., 2004 ; but see Sammler et al., 2011 ), the mitogenome represents only a single locus whereas the large number of UCE loci provided a genome-wide sample of many different genes. Moreover, modeling the rapidly evolving mitogenome data is more challenging than that of nuclear data (different models return different results as shown in the current study; see also Meiklejohn et al., 2014 ). Additionally, UCEs exhibit much less homoplasy than mitochondrial data ( McCormack et al., 2012; Meiklejohn et al., 2016 ). Thus, while understanding factors that may drive nuclear-mitochondrial differences may be of continued interest, our UCE data has likely provided an answer to the phylogenetic position of the phasianid taxa examined here. 4.3 Deep mitogenomic divergences raise the possibility of cryptic species Of the six species where mitogenomes were available from two individuals, at least one of them demonstrated substantial divergence that could represent cryptic species ( Ithaginis ). With the exception of the two Rhizothera samples, no attempt was made to sample individuals from different populations (in those five cases, one mitogenome was published and one was collected through our sequence capture). Thus, there may be additional cases within species we examined where more strategic geographic sampling could have resulted in identification of deep divergences. The single case of deep divergence occurred in a highly polymorphic species, whereas in the other five species in which we examined the mitochondria showed little or no polymorphism across their species range. Deep mitogenomic divergence alone is insufficient to split a named species but the observation of this divergence in a polytypic species is suggestive. However, it is important to note that there are a number of highly polymorphic species that also have relatively large numbers of defined subspecies within the Phasianidae overall. If these other species are like Ithaginis and show deep divergences, there may be many more species in the Phasianidae than are currently recognized.
