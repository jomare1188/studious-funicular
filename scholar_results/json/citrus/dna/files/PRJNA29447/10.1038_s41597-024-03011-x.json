    "full_text": "Abstract Suncus etruscus is one of the world’s smallest mammals, with an average body mass of about 2 grams. The Etruscan shrew’s small body is accompanied by a very high energy demand and numerous metabolic adaptations. Here we report a chromosome-level genome assembly using PacBio long read sequencing, 10X Genomics linked short reads, optical mapping, and Hi-C linked reads. The assembly is partially phased, with the 2.472 Gbp primary pseudohaplotype and 1.515 Gbp alternate. We manually curated the primary assembly and identified 22 chromosomes, including X and Y sex chromosomes. The NCBI genome annotation pipeline identified 39,091 genes, 19,819 of them protein-coding. We also identified segmental duplications, inferred GO term annotations, and computed orthologs of human and mouse genes. This reference-quality genome will be an important resource for research on mammalian development, metabolism, and body size control."

With a body weight ranging from 1.2 to 2.7 grams and dimensions spanning 36 to 53 mm in length 1 , this organism exhibits a remarkably large body surface area to volume ratio. As a result, the shrew has an exceptionally high basal metabolic rate, which requires a daily food consumption approximating 1.5 to 2.0 times its body mass 1 . Due to these unique physiological characteristics, the Etruscan shrew has become a valuable species to the scientific community, significantly contributing to various fields of research, such as behavioral science and neuroscience 1 , 2 , 3 – 4 . A high-quality genome assembly is an essential reference to enable accurate high throughput data analysis. It will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of body size control and metabolic rate, as well as facilitate comparative biological investigations."

S. etruscus is a member of the family Soricidae (the shrews), which have classically been divided into subfamilies Crocidurinae (the white-toothed shrews) and Soricinae (the red-toothed shrews). An alternative partitioning scheme distinguishes three subfamilies of the Soricidae , namely Crocidurinae (the white-toothed shrews), Soricinae (the red-toothed shrews) and Myosoricinae (African shrews) 5 . S. etruscus is a member of the Crocidurinae , which total about 220 species, representing a substantial portion of mammalian diversity. At the time of writing, there were several other sequenced shrew genomes: Crocidura indochinensis 6 , Cryptotis parvus 7 , 8 , Sorex araneus 9 , 10 , Sorex fumeus 11 , 12 , and Sorex palustris 13 . As discussed in the Technical Validation section, these genome assemblies were based on Illumina short read data, sometimes in combination with long-range technologies such as Nanopore long reads or Hi-C, which enabled scaffolding but fell short of chromosome-level assembly. C. parvus is also a very small species – which makes it an interesting comparison with S. etruscus . C. parvus is a member of the subfamily Soricinae (the red-toothed shrews). The Soricinae are generally thought to have a higher metabolism than Crocidurinae . It is clear, however, that Suncus etruscus – as a collateral of its small size – has a particularly high metabolic rate and also shows neural specializations for metabolic control 14 ."

Briefly, we used a combination of PacBio Continuous Long Read (CLR) sequencing, 10X Genomics linked reads, Bionano Genomics optical maps, and Arima Genomics Hi-C linked reads. PacBio reads were used to build the contigs and generate a pseudo-haplotype assembly, with a 2.472 Gbp primary and 1.515 Gbp alternate. 10x linked reads, optical maps, and Hi-C were used for scaffolding, and 10x linked reads were used to simultaneously polish the primary and the alternate assemblies. The primary assembly was manually curated, correcting 212 missing or missed joins, removing 28 sequences representing false haplotypic duplication, and assigning 99.9% of the sequence to 22 chromosomes, including X and Y. This karyotype was consistent with prior cytological studies 16 , 17 – 18 . The resulting reference assembly was highly contiguous, with scaffold N50 of 132 Mbp and contig N50 of 5 Mbp. Upon deposition to NCBI, it was annotated by the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation and Ensembl Rapid Release pipelines. The NCBI annotation pipeline identified 39,091 genes, 19,819 of them protein-coding. Ensembl Genebuild identified 37,534 genes, 19,562 protein-coding genes, 17,147 non-coding genes, and 825 pseudogenes."

Consensus GO terms were assigned to 26,579 protein products. We also computed protein-coding gene annotations and human/mouse orthologs using the Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments (TOGA) 22 . We used TOGA annotations of a set of ancestral mammalian genes to compare the quality of our assembly to other Eulipotyphla genomes, as discussed in the Technical Validation section below. Finally, we annotated segmental duplications as previously described 23 , 24 . Briefly, we identified resolved duplications by a whole genome self-alignment and collapsed ones by mapping CLR reads to the assembly and determining read depth using a hidden Markov model. We then used NCBI RefSeq annotations to identify genes that mapped to duplicated segments of the genome. Etruscan shrew has significantly fewer duplicated genes compared to several previously annotated species of rodents and artiodactyls 23 , 24 . GO terms, TOGA, and segmental duplications add significant value to the standard annotations provided by NCBI and Ensembl."

Tissues were minced individually with a scalpel and digested for 30 minutes at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of a 0.125 mg/ml solution of Liberase TM (Roche). 5 ml of pre-warmed fibroblast medium composed of a 50:50 mix of Alpha-MEM (Corning), 10% fetal bovine serum (Millipore) with 1x Antibiotic-Antimitotic (Life Technologies) and FBM complete (LONZA) was added to each digested tissue sample and transferred to gelatin-coated T25 tissue culture flasks (Corning).

Prior to the assembly, Genomescope2.0 28 was used on the raw 10X reads, yielding, through statistical analyses of k -mer profiles, an estimated genome size of 2.65 Gbp, heterozygosity of 0.22%, and repeat content of 0.75 Gbp. Genomescope2.0 was run with K = 31 on the histogram generated with Meryl version 1.0.0 29 using the 10X linked reads with barcodes (i.e., the first 23 bp of the forward read) trimmed off. Full details are available on VGP GenomeArk ( https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=species/Suncus_etruscus/mSunEtr1/assembly_vgp_standard_1.7/evaluation/genomescope/union_meryl_gs/ ). The assembly was performed on the DNAnexus cloud-based informatics platform for genomic data analyses ( https://www.dnanexus.com ) using the VGP standard genome assembly pipeline version 1.7 ( https://github.com/VGP/vgp-assembly ) 15 . PacBio subreads were used in the first FALCON version 2.0.2 30 contigging step. Pre-assembled contigs underwent a phasing step with FALCON-unzip version 8.0.1 31 (smrtanalysis v3.0.0) and a first round of Arrow 30 (smrtanalysis version 5.1.0.26412) polishing. FALCON version 2.0.2 and FALCON-unzip version 8.0.1 were run with default parameters, with the exception of parameters related to the identification of read overlaps, which were adjusted as described in Secomandi et al . 27 . FALCON-unzip generated a set of primary contigs representing the primary pseudo-haplotype, and a set of alternate haplotigs, representing the secondary haplotypes. Purge_dups version 1.0.0 32 was run to identify and remove false duplications. This was confirmed by the removal of most 3- and 4-copy k -mers, as evidenced by k -mer spectra computed and visualized using KAT version 2.4.2 33 (Fig. 1 ).

Two scaffolding rounds with scaff10X version 2.0.3 ( https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/Scaff10X ) were performed with options -matrix 2000 -reads 12 -link 10 and then -matrix 2000 -reads 8 -link 10 . The resulting intermediate was then scaffolded with Bionano DLS optical maps 34 using Bionano Solve version 3.4.0 in non-haplotype assembly mode with a DLE-1 one enzyme non-nicking approach. Finally, Hi-C scaffolding was performed as described in Secomandi et al . 27 . Briefly, Hi-C reads from Arima were aligned with the Arima Genomics mapping pipeline ( https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline ) and scaffolded with Salsa version 2.2 35 with -m yes -i 5 -p yes parameters and -e GATC,GANTC,CTNAG,TTAA as restriction enzymes. In order to improve per-base accuracy (QV) 15 , the assembly was polished as previously described in Secomandi et al . 27 . To prevent haplotype switches and overpolishing of nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs) 15 , 36 , the scaffolded primary assembly was merged with alternate combined haplotigs. The combined intermediate was polished with gcpp version 2.0.2 (pacific Biosciences; smrtanalysis version 5.1.0.26412) with the command ‘ pbalign --minAccuracy = 0.75 --minLength = 50 --minAnchorSize = 12 --maxDivergence = 30 --concordant --algorithm = blasr --algorithmOptions = --useQuality --maxHits = 1 --hitPolicy = random --seed = 1 ’ for read alignment, and with ‘ variantCaller --skipUnrecognizedContigs haploid -x 5 -q 20 -X120 -v --algorithm = arrow ’ for consensus polishing, using PacBio CLR. Variant calls were filtered with merfin version 1.0 to reduce false positives. Two additional rounds of polishing with linked-reads were performed to generate the final polished assembly. In this step, raw-reads were aligned with Longranger align version 2.2.2 and variants were called with Freebayes version 1.3.1 37 with default parameters.

To assign GO terms to protein-coding genes, we used three sequence-based protein function prediction methods: PFP 19 , Phylo-PFP 20 , and ESG 21 . The PFP algorithm uses a scoring method based on E-values to combine GO terms associated with PSI-BLAST 44 sequence hits, and it then propagates scores to parental terms on the GO directed acyclic graph (DAG) according to the number of known sequences annotated with parent and child terms. Additionally, based on accuracy evaluations over a set of benchmark sequences, it assigns a confidence score to GO term predictions. Phylo-PFP is a modification of PFP that significantly improves the prediction performance by incorporating phylogenetic information in defining sequence similarity. The ESG method performs iterative sequence database searches and annotates a query sequence with GO terms. Each annotation is given a probability based on how similar it is to other sequences in the protein similarity graph."

Our workflow and the overview of duplicated genes are shown in Fig. 2a,b . Briefly, self-alignments enable identification of assembly segments that are highly similar to each other, constituting resolved duplications, while excessive read depth is indicative of collapsed duplications, where two or more copies of a genomic segment had not been resolved by the assembly process. In order to detect collapsed duplications, we mapped CLR reads to the assembly using minimap2 version 2.22 and determined read depth using a hidden Markov model 49 , 50 . We then used Etruscan shrew RefSeq annotations as gene models to identify duplicated genes also using minimap2 and Needleman Wunsch as implemented by edlib version 1.3.9 51 , 52 . We were able to identify 15 such genes, six of which had collapsed duplications in the assembly and 10 resolved, with one gene having both (Table 1 ). Read depths of the four out of six genes with collapsed duplications were inconsistent across the length of the gene, suggesting the presence of truncated copies (Fig. 2c ). We annotated such duplications as “partial”. Of the 189,717.5 collapsed kbps detected, 44.2 were in fully collapsed genes and 98,305.9 in partially collapsed genes. There were another 233.3 kbps in resolved duplications. Additionally, we found an 8 kbp segmental duplication to have an insertion in an intronic region of ADM2 . This duplication was found at 74 loci across 21 chromosomes and is composed of 48% ancient mobile elements (0.66–0.83 similarity to consensus), primarily endogenous retroviruses ERV2-2-I_BT and HERVK, as well as Gypsy elements according to CENSOR 53 . This segmental duplication did not have any BLAST hits in the NCBI nr/nt database. Fig. 2 Segmental duplications. ( a ) Segmental Duplication Annotation Pipeline flowchart.

The sum of the measured depth over assembly depth is in the ‘Num Expected Copies’ column. Generally, we expect the number of resolved plus collapsed copies to equal expected copies. However, the expected copy count is lower than this sum when read depth per resolved copy of a given gene is sufficiently low compared to the average read depth of the genome (Fig. 2b ). This can be caused by some of the resolved gene copies present in the assembly being spurious or, when the duplicated region is heterozygous, by some reads mapping to the alternate haplotype. *Genes with partial collapsed duplications."

The genome was assembled as previously described in Secomandi et al . 27 , with minor modifications. Prior to the assembly, Genomescope2.0 28 was used on the raw 10X reads, yielding, through statistical analyses of k -mer profiles, an estimated genome size of 2.65 Gbp, heterozygosity of 0.22%, and repeat content of 0.75 Gbp. Genomescope2.0 was run with K = 31 on the histogram generated with Meryl version 1.0.0 29 using the 10X linked reads with barcodes (i.e., the first 23 bp of the forward read) trimmed off.

PacBio subreads were used in the first FALCON version 2.0.2 30 contigging step. Pre-assembled contigs underwent a phasing step with FALCON-unzip version 8.0.1 31 (smrtanalysis v3.0.0) and a first round of Arrow 30 (smrtanalysis version 5.1.0.26412) polishing. FALCON version 2.0.2 and FALCON-unzip version 8.0.1 were run with default parameters, with the exception of parameters related to the identification of read overlaps, which were adjusted as described in Secomandi et al . 27 .

The resulting intermediate was then scaffolded with Bionano DLS optical maps 34 using Bionano Solve version 3.4.0 in non-haplotype assembly mode with a DLE-1 one enzyme non-nicking approach. Finally, Hi-C scaffolding was performed as described in Secomandi et al . 27 .

The PFP algorithm uses a scoring method based on E-values to combine GO terms associated with PSI-BLAST 44 sequence hits, and it then propagates scores to parental terms on the GO directed acyclic graph (DAG) according to the number of known sequences annotated with parent and child terms. Additionally, based on accuracy evaluations over a set of benchmark sequences, it assigns a confidence score to GO term predictions. Phylo-PFP is a modification of PFP that significantly improves the prediction performance by incorporating phylogenetic information in defining sequence similarity. The ESG method performs iterative sequence database searches and annotates a query sequence with GO terms. Each annotation is given a probability based on how similar it is to other sequences in the protein similarity graph."

Our workflow and the overview of duplicated genes are shown in Fig. 2a,b . Briefly, self-alignments enable identification of assembly segments that are highly similar to each other, constituting resolved duplications, while excessive read depth is indicative of collapsed duplications, where two or more copies of a genomic segment had not been resolved by the assembly process. In order to detect collapsed duplications, we mapped CLR reads to the assembly using minimap2 version 2.22 and determined read depth using a hidden Markov model 49 , 50 . We then used Etruscan shrew RefSeq annotations as gene models to identify duplicated genes also using minimap2 and Needleman Wunsch as implemented by edlib version 1.3.9 51 , 52 . We were able to identify 15 such genes, six of which had collapsed duplications in the assembly and 10 resolved, with one gene having both (Table 1 ). Read depths of the four out of six genes with collapsed duplications were inconsistent across the length of the gene, suggesting the presence of truncated copies (Fig. 2c ). We annotated such duplications as “partial”. Of the 189,717.5 collapsed kbps detected, 44.2 were in fully collapsed genes and 98,305.9 in partially collapsed genes. There were another 233.3 kbps in resolved duplications. Additionally, we found an 8 kbp segmental duplication to have an insertion in an intronic region of ADM2 . This duplication was found at 74 loci across 21 chromosomes and is composed of 48% ancient mobile elements (0.66–0.83 similarity to consensus), primarily endogenous retroviruses ERV2-2-I_BT and HERVK, as well as Gypsy elements according to CENSOR 53 .

The genome was assembled as previously described in Secomandi et al . 27 , with minor modifications. Prior to the assembly, Genomescope2.0 28 was used on the raw 10X reads, yielding, through statistical analyses of k -mer profiles, an estimated genome size of 2.65 Gbp, heterozygosity of 0.22%, and repeat content of 0.75 Gbp. Genomescope2.0 was run with K = 31 on the histogram generated with Meryl version 1.0.0 29 using the 10X linked reads with barcodes (i.e., the first 23 bp of the forward read) trimmed off. Full details are available on VGP GenomeArk ( https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=species/Suncus_etruscus/mSunEtr1/assembly_vgp_standard_1.7/evaluation/genomescope/union_meryl_gs/ ). The assembly was performed on the DNAnexus cloud-based informatics platform for genomic data analyses ( https://www.dnanexus.com ) using the VGP standard genome assembly pipeline version 1.7 ( https://github.com/VGP/vgp-assembly ) 15 . PacBio subreads were used in the first FALCON version 2.0.2 30 contigging step. Pre-assembled contigs underwent a phasing step with FALCON-unzip version 8.0.1 31 (smrtanalysis v3.0.0) and a first round of Arrow 30 (smrtanalysis version 5.1.0.26412) polishing. FALCON version 2.0.2 and FALCON-unzip version 8.0.1 were run with default parameters, with the exception of parameters related to the identification of read overlaps, which were adjusted as described in Secomandi et al . 27 . FALCON-unzip generated a set of primary contigs representing the primary pseudo-haplotype, and a set of alternate haplotigs, representing the secondary haplotypes. Purge_dups version 1.0.0 32 was run to identify and remove false duplications. This was confirmed by the removal of most 3- and 4-copy k -mers, as evidenced by k -mer spectra computed and visualized using KAT version 2.4.2 33 (Fig. 1 ).

The resulting intermediate was then scaffolded with Bionano DLS optical maps 34 using Bionano Solve version 3.4.0 in non-haplotype assembly mode with a DLE-1 one enzyme non-nicking approach. Finally, Hi-C scaffolding was performed as described in Secomandi et al . 27 . Briefly, Hi-C reads from Arima were aligned with the Arima Genomics mapping pipeline ( https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline ) and scaffolded with Salsa version 2.2 35 with -m yes -i 5 -p yes parameters and -e GATC,GANTC,CTNAG,TTAA as restriction enzymes. In order to improve per-base accuracy (QV) 15 , the assembly was polished as previously described in Secomandi et al . 27 . To prevent haplotype switches and overpolishing of nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs) 15 , 36 , the scaffolded primary assembly was merged with alternate combined haplotigs. The combined intermediate was polished with gcpp version 2.0.2 (pacific Biosciences; smrtanalysis version 5.1.0.26412) with the command ‘ pbalign --minAccuracy = 0.75 --minLength = 50 --minAnchorSize = 12 --maxDivergence = 30 --concordant --algorithm = blasr --algorithmOptions = --useQuality --maxHits = 1 --hitPolicy = random --seed = 1 ’ for read alignment, and with ‘ variantCaller --skipUnrecognizedContigs haploid -x 5 -q 20 -X120 -v --algorithm = arrow ’ for consensus polishing, using PacBio CLR. Variant calls were filtered with merfin version 1.0 to reduce false positives. Two additional rounds of polishing with linked-reads were performed to generate the final polished assembly. In this step, raw-reads were aligned with Longranger align version 2.2.2 and variants were called with Freebayes version 1.3.1 37 with default parameters. Finally, bcftools version 1.9 ( https://github.com/VGP/vgp-assembly/blob/master/dx_applets/bcftools_consensus/asset/Makefile ) consensus 38 , 39 with options -i 'QUAL > 1 && (GT = \"AA\" || GT = \"Aa\")' -Hla was used to generate the consensus."

To assign GO terms to protein-coding genes, we used three sequence-based protein function prediction methods: PFP 19 , Phylo-PFP 20 , and ESG 21 . The PFP algorithm uses a scoring method based on E-values to combine GO terms associated with PSI-BLAST 44 sequence hits, and it then propagates scores to parental terms on the GO directed acyclic graph (DAG) according to the number of known sequences annotated with parent and child terms. Additionally, based on accuracy evaluations over a set of benchmark sequences, it assigns a confidence score to GO term predictions. Phylo-PFP is a modification of PFP that significantly improves the prediction performance by incorporating phylogenetic information in defining sequence similarity. The ESG method performs iterative sequence database searches and annotates a query sequence with GO terms. Each annotation is given a probability based on how similar it is to other sequences in the protein similarity graph."

Our workflow and the overview of duplicated genes are shown in Fig. 2a,b . Briefly, self-alignments enable identification of assembly segments that are highly similar to each other, constituting resolved duplications, while excessive read depth is indicative of collapsed duplications, where two or more copies of a genomic segment had not been resolved by the assembly process. In order to detect collapsed duplications, we mapped CLR reads to the assembly using minimap2 version 2.22 and determined read depth using a hidden Markov model 49 , 50 . We then used Etruscan shrew RefSeq annotations as gene models to identify duplicated genes also using minimap2 and Needleman Wunsch as implemented by edlib version 1.3.9 51 , 52 . We were able to identify 15 such genes, six of which had collapsed duplications in the assembly and 10 resolved, with one gene having both (Table 1 ). Read depths of the four out of six genes with collapsed duplications were inconsistent across the length of the gene, suggesting the presence of truncated copies (Fig. 2c ). We annotated such duplications as “partial”. Of the 189,717.5 collapsed kbps detected, 44.2 were in fully collapsed genes and 98,305.9 in partially collapsed genes. There were another 233.3 kbps in resolved duplications. Additionally, we found an 8 kbp segmental duplication to have an insertion in an intronic region of ADM2 . This duplication was found at 74 loci across 21 chromosomes and is composed of 48% ancient mobile elements (0.66–0.83 similarity to consensus), primarily endogenous retroviruses ERV2-2-I_BT and HERVK, as well as Gypsy elements according to CENSOR 53 . This segmental duplication did not have any BLAST hits in the NCBI nr/nt database. Fig. 2 Segmental duplications. ( a ) Segmental Duplication Annotation Pipeline flowchart.

The sum of the measured depth over assembly depth is in the ‘Num Expected Copies’ column. Generally, we expect the number of resolved plus collapsed copies to equal expected copies. However, the expected copy count is lower than this sum when read depth per resolved copy of a given gene is sufficiently low compared to the average read depth of the genome (Fig. 2b ). This can be caused by some of the resolved gene copies present in the assembly being spurious or, when the duplicated region is heterozygous, by some reads mapping to the alternate haplotype. *Genes with partial collapsed duplications."

The spectra are clean, with many diploid regions shared between the two assemblies; however, there are still some homozygous areas missing from the alternate, which is to be expected. The plots do not indicate the presence of false duplicate k -mers in the primary assembly (Fig. 4 ). The primary spectra-cn (Fig. 4c ) shows that the primary assembly retains much of the heterozygous regions, but does not have any false duplicates. Accordingly, the alternate spectra-cn (Fig. 4d ) has a bump of read-only k -mers at haploid coverage, but these are the heterozygous regions that are present in the primary assembly, so they are not actually missing across the two pseudohaplotype assemblies. The primary assembly is the more complete of the two, containing both the homozygous regions as well as heterozygous variants (Fig. 4b ). Fig. 4 K-mer spectra generated using the Merqury software.

All of the other assemblies were based on short read technologies, with the exception of Talpa occidentalis (Iberian mole) 65 , which also used PacBio CLR, but not the VGP protocols for higher quality phasing, scaffolding, and curation. At the time of writing, our assembly was the most contiguous, having the highest contig N50 and scaffold N50 compared to the other assemblies. Contig N50 values of long-read-based assemblies tend to be orders of magnitude higher than those of short-read-based ones, as evidenced by Fig. 5a . For this study, this translated into having fewer fragmented genes as assessed by BUSCO 62 , 63 (Fig. 5b ). At the time of writing, BUSCO scores were only available for four Eulipotyphla genomes, of which ours had the highest % Complete and lowest % Fragmented score. The species and genome assembly versions included in this analysis are available on OSF 66 . Fig. 5 Quality metrics of Eulipotyphla genome assemblies reported by NCBI.

Our assembly performed about average in terms of the number of intact ancestral open reading frames (ORFs) (Table 3 ). We had relatively few genes that had missing sequence, reflecting the high contiguity and completeness of our assembly. However, a relatively high number of ancestral genes had inactivating mutations: 2,405, compared to between 940 and 1,483 in other high-quality Eulipotyphla genomes. It is likely that many of these apparent mutations are really sequencing errors caused by the lower base-level accuracy of the version of PacBio technology used in this project compared to short read technologies, which could not be fully compensated for by polishing. Despite this issue, our assembly is of sufficiently high quality to serve as a useful reference for transcriptomics and most other purposes. The high contiguity, completeness, and thorough annotation make it a valuable resource for future studies of metabolism and development of one of the world’s smallest mammals.

All of the other assemblies were based on short read technologies, with the exception of Talpa occidentalis (Iberian mole) 65 , which also used PacBio CLR, but not the VGP protocols for higher quality phasing, scaffolding, and curation. At the time of writing, our assembly was the most contiguous, having the highest contig N50 and scaffold N50 compared to the other assemblies. Contig N50 values of long-read-based assemblies tend to be orders of magnitude higher than those of short-read-based ones, as evidenced by Fig. 5a . For this study, this translated into having fewer fragmented genes as assessed by BUSCO 62 , 63 (Fig. 5b ). At the time of writing, BUSCO scores were only available for four Eulipotyphla genomes, of which ours had the highest % Complete and lowest % Fragmented score.

Our assembly performed about average in terms of the number of intact ancestral open reading frames (ORFs) (Table 3 ). We had relatively few genes that had missing sequence, reflecting the high contiguity and completeness of our assembly. However, a relatively high number of ancestral genes had inactivating mutations: 2,405, compared to between 940 and 1,483 in other high-quality Eulipotyphla genomes. It is likely that many of these apparent mutations are really sequencing errors caused by the lower base-level accuracy of the version of PacBio technology used in this project compared to short read technologies, which could not be fully compensated for by polishing. Despite this issue, our assembly is of sufficiently high quality to serve as a useful reference for transcriptomics and most other purposes. The high contiguity, completeness, and thorough annotation make it a valuable resource for future studies of metabolism and development of one of the world’s smallest mammals.

The spectra are clean, with many diploid regions shared between the two assemblies; however, there are still some homozygous areas missing from the alternate, which is to be expected. The plots do not indicate the presence of false duplicate k -mers in the primary assembly (Fig. 4 ). The primary spectra-cn (Fig. 4c ) shows that the primary assembly retains much of the heterozygous regions, but does not have any false duplicates. Accordingly, the alternate spectra-cn (Fig. 4d ) has a bump of read-only k -mers at haploid coverage, but these are the heterozygous regions that are present in the primary assembly, so they are not actually missing across the two pseudohaplotype assemblies. The primary assembly is the more complete of the two, containing both the homozygous regions as well as heterozygous variants (Fig. 4b ). Fig. 4 K-mer spectra generated using the Merqury software.

All of the other assemblies were based on short read technologies, with the exception of Talpa occidentalis (Iberian mole) 65 , which also used PacBio CLR, but not the VGP protocols for higher quality phasing, scaffolding, and curation. At the time of writing, our assembly was the most contiguous, having the highest contig N50 and scaffold N50 compared to the other assemblies. Contig N50 values of long-read-based assemblies tend to be orders of magnitude higher than those of short-read-based ones, as evidenced by Fig. 5a . For this study, this translated into having fewer fragmented genes as assessed by BUSCO 62 , 63 (Fig. 5b ). At the time of writing, BUSCO scores were only available for four Eulipotyphla genomes, of which ours had the highest % Complete and lowest % Fragmented score. The species and genome assembly versions included in this analysis are available on OSF 66 . Fig. 5 Quality metrics of Eulipotyphla genome assemblies reported by NCBI.

Our assembly performed about average in terms of the number of intact ancestral open reading frames (ORFs) (Table 3 ). We had relatively few genes that had missing sequence, reflecting the high contiguity and completeness of our assembly. However, a relatively high number of ancestral genes had inactivating mutations: 2,405, compared to between 940 and 1,483 in other high-quality Eulipotyphla genomes. It is likely that many of these apparent mutations are really sequencing errors caused by the lower base-level accuracy of the version of PacBio technology used in this project compared to short read technologies, which could not be fully compensated for by polishing. Despite this issue, our assembly is of sufficiently high quality to serve as a useful reference for transcriptomics and most other purposes. The high contiguity, completeness, and thorough annotation make it a valuable resource for future studies of metabolism and development of one of the world’s smallest mammals.

    "full_text": "Background & Summary The Etruscan shrew ( Suncus etruscus ), also known as the white-toothed pygmy shrew, is recognized as one of the smallest mammals living today. With a body weight ranging from 1.2 to 2.7 grams and dimensions spanning 36 to 53 mm in length 1 , this organism exhibits a remarkably large body surface area to volume ratio. As a result, the shrew has an exceptionally high basal metabolic rate, which requires a daily food consumption approximating 1.5 to 2.0 times its body mass 1 . Due to these unique physiological characteristics, the Etruscan shrew has become a valuable species to the scientific community, significantly contributing to various fields of research, such as behavioral science and neuroscience 1 , 2 , 3 – 4 . A high-quality genome assembly is an essential reference to enable accurate high throughput data analysis. It will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of body size control and metabolic rate, as well as facilitate comparative biological investigations. Our new Suncus etruscus genome is the first chromosome-level genome assembly of the order Eulipotyphla . S. etruscus is a member of the family Soricidae (the shrews), which have classically been divided into subfamilies Crocidurinae (the white-toothed shrews) and Soricinae (the red-toothed shrews). An alternative partitioning scheme distinguishes three subfamilies of the Soricidae , namely Crocidurinae (the white-toothed shrews), Soricinae (the red-toothed shrews) and Myosoricinae (African shrews) 5 . S. etruscus is a member of the Crocidurinae , which total about 220 species, representing a substantial portion of mammalian diversity. At the time of writing, there were several other sequenced shrew genomes: Crocidura indochinensis 6 , Cryptotis parvus 7 , 8 , Sorex araneus 9 , 10 , Sorex fumeus 11 , 12 , and Sorex palustris 13 . As discussed in the Technical Validation section, these genome assemblies were based on Illumina short read data, sometimes in combination with long-range technologies such as Nanopore long reads or Hi-C, which enabled scaffolding but fell short of chromosome-level assembly. C. parvus is also a very small species – which makes it an interesting comparison with S. etruscus . C. parvus is a member of the subfamily Soricinae (the red-toothed shrews). The Soricinae are generally thought to have a higher metabolism than Crocidurinae . It is clear, however, that Suncus etruscus – as a collateral of its small size – has a particularly high metabolic rate and also shows neural specializations for metabolic control 14 . We sequenced and assembled the Etruscan shrew genome, of a male, using protocols developed by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) to generate a reference-quality genome assembly 15 . Briefly, we used a combination of PacBio Continuous Long Read (CLR) sequencing, 10X Genomics linked reads, Bionano Genomics optical maps, and Arima Genomics Hi-C linked reads. PacBio reads were used to build the contigs and generate a pseudo-haplotype assembly, with a 2.472 Gbp primary and 1.515 Gbp alternate. 10x linked reads, optical maps, and Hi-C were used for scaffolding, and 10x linked reads were used to simultaneously polish the primary and the alternate assemblies. The primary assembly was manually curated, correcting 212 missing or missed joins, removing 28 sequences representing false haplotypic duplication, and assigning 99.9% of the sequence to 22 chromosomes, including X and Y. This karyotype was consistent with prior cytological studies 16 , 17 – 18 . The resulting reference assembly was highly contiguous, with scaffold N50 of 132 Mbp and contig N50 of 5 Mbp. Upon deposition to NCBI, it was annotated by the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation and Ensembl Rapid Release pipelines. The NCBI annotation pipeline identified 39,091 genes, 19,819 of them protein-coding. Ensembl Genebuild identified 37,534 genes, 19,562 protein-coding genes, 17,147 non-coding genes, and 825 pseudogenes. We next computationally inferred Gene Ontology (GO) terms for the protein-coding genes predicted by NCBI using software developed in the Kihara Lab, including Protein Function Prediction (PFP) 19 , Phylogenetic tree-based Protein Function Prediction (Phylo-PFP) 20 , and Extended Similarity Group (ESG) 21 . Consensus GO terms were assigned to 26,579 protein products. We also computed protein-coding gene annotations and human/mouse orthologs using the Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments (TOGA) 22 . We used TOGA annotations of a set of ancestral mammalian genes to compare the quality of our assembly to other Eulipotyphla genomes, as discussed in the Technical Validation section below. Finally, we annotated segmental duplications as previously described 23 , 24 . Briefly, we identified resolved duplications by a whole genome self-alignment and collapsed ones by mapping CLR reads to the assembly and determining read depth using a hidden Markov model. We then used NCBI RefSeq annotations to identify genes that mapped to duplicated segments of the genome. Etruscan shrew has significantly fewer duplicated genes compared to several previously annotated species of rodents and artiodactyls 23 , 24 . GO terms, TOGA, and segmental duplications add significant value to the standard annotations provided by NCBI and Ensembl. Methods Sample collection and ethics statement One adult male Etruscan shrew ( Suncus etruscus ) was provided by Dr. Michael Brecht, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany. The shrew was captive-born and housed in Dr. Brecht’s colony 25 . All procedures complied with German regulations on animal welfare and were approved by an ethics committee 26 . Etruscan shrew tissue was collected according to a permit T0078/16 given to the Brecht group. The Etruscan shrew was euthanized using an overdose of isoflurane and dissected under a microscope. Skin, heart, lung, and muscle tissue were collected for primary fibroblast culture, which would provide an unlimited source of cellular material for genomic and developmental studies. The shrew tissues were transferred into separate tubes containing ice-cold Alpha-MEM (Corning) with 1x Antibiotic-Antimitotic (Life Technologies). Tissues were minced individually with a scalpel and digested for 30 minutes at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of a 0.125 mg/ml solution of Liberase TM (Roche). 5 ml of pre-warmed fibroblast medium composed of a 50:50 mix of Alpha-MEM (Corning), 10% fetal bovine serum (Millipore) with 1x Antibiotic-Antimitotic (Life Technologies) and FBM complete (LONZA) was added to each digested tissue sample and transferred to gelatin-coated T25 tissue culture flasks (Corning). Spent medium was replaced carefully every other day without disturbing the adhering tissue pieces. After 7 days of incubation and maintenance at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , 4% O 2 , a lung fibroblast culture began to develop. The remaining tissues failed to yield cell cultures and were discarded. Once the lung fibroblast culture reached confluency, it was passaged, banked, expanded, and sent to the Rockefeller University for genomic DNA isolation. DNA isolation was performed at the Rockefeller University Vertebrate Genome Lab. Two million cells stored at −80 °C were used to extract high molecular weight DNA with the Bionano SP Blood and Cell Culture DNA Isolation Kit (Bionano PN 80042) following manufacturer’s protocols. This method utilizes gentle lysis and Nanobind magnetic disks to prevent DNA breakage and preserve large fragment lengths (>100–300 kb) needed for long-read sequencing. Genome sequencing and assembly PacBio and 10X sequencing, optical mapping, and Hi-C generation were performed by the Rockefeller University Vertebrate Genome Laboratory using standard VGP protocols as previously described in Secomandi et al . 27 . The genome was assembled as previously described in Secomandi et al . 27 , with minor modifications. Prior to the assembly, Genomescope2.0 28 was used on the raw 10X reads, yielding, through statistical analyses of k -mer profiles, an estimated genome size of 2.65 Gbp, heterozygosity of 0.22%, and repeat content of 0.75 Gbp. Genomescope2.0 was run with K = 31 on the histogram generated with Meryl version 1.0.0 29 using the 10X linked reads with barcodes (i.e., the first 23 bp of the forward read) trimmed off. Full details are available on VGP GenomeArk ( https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=species/Suncus_etruscus/mSunEtr1/assembly_vgp_standard_1.7/evaluation/genomescope/union_meryl_gs/ ). The assembly was performed on the DNAnexus cloud-based informatics platform for genomic data analyses ( https://www.dnanexus.com ) using the VGP standard genome assembly pipeline version 1.7 ( https://github.com/VGP/vgp-assembly ) 15 . PacBio subreads were used in the first FALCON version 2.0.2 30 contigging step. Pre-assembled contigs underwent a phasing step with FALCON-unzip version 8.0.1 31 (smrtanalysis v3.0.0) and a first round of Arrow 30 (smrtanalysis version 5.1.0.26412) polishing. FALCON version 2.0.2 and FALCON-unzip version 8.0.1 were run with default parameters, with the exception of parameters related to the identification of read overlaps, which were adjusted as described in Secomandi et al . 27 . FALCON-unzip generated a set of primary contigs representing the primary pseudo-haplotype, and a set of alternate haplotigs, representing the secondary haplotypes. Purge_dups version 1.0.0 32 was run to identify and remove false duplications. This was confirmed by the removal of most 3- and 4-copy k -mers, as evidenced by k -mer spectra computed and visualized using KAT version 2.4.2 33 (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Removal of false duplications confirmed by k-mer spectra. K-mer spectra before ( a ) and after ( b ) false duplication removal. After removing false duplications, a three-steps scaffolding strategy was performed on the purged primary contigs using Illumina short-reads (10x Genomics), Bionano optical maps and Hi-C reads. Two scaffolding rounds with scaff10X version 2.0.3 ( https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/Scaff10X ) were performed with options -matrix 2000 -reads 12 -link 10 and then -matrix 2000 -reads 8 -link 10 . The resulting intermediate was then scaffolded with Bionano DLS optical maps 34 using Bionano Solve version 3.4.0 in non-haplotype assembly mode with a DLE-1 one enzyme non-nicking approach. Finally, Hi-C scaffolding was performed as described in Secomandi et al . 27 . Briefly, Hi-C reads from Arima were aligned with the Arima Genomics mapping pipeline ( https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline ) and scaffolded with Salsa version 2.2 35 with -m yes -i 5 -p yes parameters and -e GATC,GANTC,CTNAG,TTAA as restriction enzymes. In order to improve per-base accuracy (QV) 15 , the assembly was polished as previously described in Secomandi et al . 27 . To prevent haplotype switches and overpolishing of nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs) 15 , 36 , the scaffolded primary assembly was merged with alternate combined haplotigs. The combined intermediate was polished with gcpp version 2.0.2 (pacific Biosciences; smrtanalysis version 5.1.0.26412) with the command ‘ pbalign --minAccuracy = 0.75 --minLength = 50 --minAnchorSize = 12 --maxDivergence = 30 --concordant --algorithm = blasr --algorithmOptions = --useQuality --maxHits = 1 --hitPolicy = random --seed = 1 ’ for read alignment, and with ‘ variantCaller --skipUnrecognizedContigs haploid -x 5 -q 20 -X120 -v --algorithm = arrow ’ for consensus polishing, using PacBio CLR. Variant calls were filtered with merfin version 1.0 to reduce false positives. Two additional rounds of polishing with linked-reads were performed to generate the final polished assembly. In this step, raw-reads were aligned with Longranger align version 2.2.2 and variants were called with Freebayes version 1.3.1 37 with default parameters. Finally, bcftools version 1.9 ( https://github.com/VGP/vgp-assembly/blob/master/dx_applets/bcftools_consensus/asset/Makefile ) consensus 38 , 39 with options -i 'QUAL > 1 && (GT = \"AA\" || GT = \"Aa\")' -Hla was used to generate the consensus. We generated a complete reference mitochondrial sequence using mitoVGP version 2.2 36 with standard parameters. The mitogenome was annotated using MITOS2 40 . We merged the mitochondrial assembly with the primary and alternate pseudohaplotypes of the nuclear genome prior to polishing, the mitochondrial genome serving as a sink to avoid overpolishing of the NUMTs. The Etruscan shrew mitogenome was typical of a mammal. It had a total length of 16,982 base pairs and a GC content of 34.74%. We did not detect any issues or anomalies, such as gene duplications. Manual curation of the genome assembly Manual curation of the generated assembly was performed using a previously described protocol by Howe et al . 41 . In order to remove contaminants, sequences were screened for trailing ‘N’ bases and clipped and VecScreen revision 87677 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/ ) was run to remove known adaptors and barcodes. Mitochondrial sequences were removed following a blast check against the assembled mitochondrial genome. Finally the assembly was screened against the RefSeq genomes database for other potential species contamination. Following contaminant screening, the scaffold assembly was visualized in gEVAL 42 and the Hi-C contact matrix displayed in HiGlass version 1.11.7 43 and PretextView version 0.2.3 ( https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextView ) in order to investigate the assembly and produce a chromosome scale reference. The curation corrected 212 missing or missed joins and removed 28 sequences representing haplotypic duplication. This resulted in a genome with 99.9% of sequence assigned to 22 chromosome-level scaffolds, including X and Y chromosomes. Gene ontology (GO) annotation of protein-coding genes Protein-coding genes were annotated by NCBI ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/gene/GCF_024139225.1/?gene_type=protein-coding ). To assign GO terms to protein-coding genes, we used three sequence-based protein function prediction methods: PFP 19 , Phylo-PFP 20 , and ESG 21 . The PFP algorithm uses a scoring method based on E-values to combine GO terms associated with PSI-BLAST 44 sequence hits, and it then propagates scores to parental terms on the GO directed acyclic graph (DAG) according to the number of known sequences annotated with parent and child terms. Additionally, based on accuracy evaluations over a set of benchmark sequences, it assigns a confidence score to GO term predictions. Phylo-PFP is a modification of PFP that significantly improves the prediction performance by incorporating phylogenetic information in defining sequence similarity. The ESG method performs iterative sequence database searches and annotates a query sequence with GO terms. Each annotation is given a probability based on how similar it is to other sequences in the protein similarity graph. To capture the significant GO terms annotations, we only considered the predictions with high confidence. The confidence score cutoff for PFP, Phylo-PFP, and ESG is 10,000, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively, and all GO terms with scores above the cutoff are reported in this analysis. To make our predictions more reliable, we also considered the consensus between different prediction methods and reported the GO term predicted as high confidence by any two of the three above-mentioned methods. Annotation of protein-coding genes using TOGA We used TOGA version 1.0 ( https://github.com/hillerlab/TOGA ) 22 to assess gene completeness, provide coding gene annotations, and infer orthologs to human and mouse. Briefly, we first computed pairwise genome alignment chains between human (hg38 assembly, GRCh38.p12) and mouse (mm10, GRCm38) as the reference species and the Etruscan shrew as the query species, using lastz version 1.04.15 (parameters K = 2400, L = 3000, Y = 9400, H = 2000, default scoring matrix), axtChain version 1.0 (default parameters except linearGap = loose), RepeatFiller version 1.0, and chainCleaner version 1.0 (default parameters except minBrokenChainScore = 75,000 and -doPairs) 45 , 46 – 47 . We used TOGA version 1.0 with the human GENCODE V38 and mouse GENCODE M25 annotation as input ( https://github.com/hillerlab/TOGA/tree/master/TOGAInput ). TOGA then infers orthologous gene loci using machine learning and alignments of intronic and intergenic loci, and annotates and classifies orthologous genes. To compare assembly completeness and base accuracy, we considered 18,430 genes that already existed in the placental mammal ancestor 48 ( https://github.com/hillerlab/TOGA/blob/master/TOGAInput/human_hg38/Ancestral_placental.txt ) and used a Python script, https://github.com/hillerlab/TOGA/blob/master/supply/TOGA_assemblyStats.py , with the human-referenced TOGA classification to count how many genes have an intact reading frame, inactivating mutations, or missing sequence due to assembly gaps or assembly fragmentation. Segmental duplications We identified segmental duplications and the duplicated genes using a combination of self-alignments and read depth ( https://github.com/ChaissonLab/SegDupAnnotation2 ). Our workflow and the overview of duplicated genes are shown in Fig. 2a,b . Briefly, self-alignments enable identification of assembly segments that are highly similar to each other, constituting resolved duplications, while excessive read depth is indicative of collapsed duplications, where two or more copies of a genomic segment had not been resolved by the assembly process. In order to detect collapsed duplications, we mapped CLR reads to the assembly using minimap2 version 2.22 and determined read depth using a hidden Markov model 49 , 50 . We then used Etruscan shrew RefSeq annotations as gene models to identify duplicated genes also using minimap2 and Needleman Wunsch as implemented by edlib version 1.3.9 51 , 52 . We were able to identify 15 such genes, six of which had collapsed duplications in the assembly and 10 resolved, with one gene having both (Table 1 ). Read depths of the four out of six genes with collapsed duplications were inconsistent across the length of the gene, suggesting the presence of truncated copies (Fig. 2c ). We annotated such duplications as “partial”. Of the 189,717.5 collapsed kbps detected, 44.2 were in fully collapsed genes and 98,305.9 in partially collapsed genes. There were another 233.3 kbps in resolved duplications. Additionally, we found an 8 kbp segmental duplication to have an insertion in an intronic region of ADM2 . This duplication was found at 74 loci across 21 chromosomes and is composed of 48% ancient mobile elements (0.66–0.83 similarity to consensus), primarily endogenous retroviruses ERV2-2-I_BT and HERVK, as well as Gypsy elements according to CENSOR 53 . This segmental duplication did not have any BLAST hits in the NCBI nr/nt database. Fig. 2 Segmental duplications. ( a ) Segmental Duplication Annotation Pipeline flowchart. ( b ) Mean gene copy depth over assembly depth plotted for all duplicated genes. The top plot highlights genes with collapses. The vertical gray line indicates the mean assembly coverage. ( c ) Coverage maps of partially collapsed genes. Mean coverage over gene and the assembly are shown in green and red respectively. Table 1 Estimated copy numbers of duplicated genes.

The sum of the measured depth over assembly depth is in the ‘Num Expected Copies’ column. Generally, we expect the number of resolved plus collapsed copies to equal expected copies. However, the expected copy count is lower than this sum when read depth per resolved copy of a given gene is sufficiently low compared to the average read depth of the genome (Fig. 2b ). This can be caused by some of the resolved gene copies present in the assembly being spurious or, when the duplicated region is heterozygous, by some reads mapping to the alternate haplotype. *Genes with partial collapsed duplications.

Technical Validation Assembly quality assessment Our assembly quality metrics computed with gfastats version 1.3.6 61 and Merqury version 1.3 29 are summarized in Table 2 . The assembly is partially phased, with 2.5 Gbp primary and 1.5 Gbp alternate pseudohaplotypes. The primary pseudohaplotype is highly contiguous, with scaffold N50 of 132 Mbp and contig N50 of 5 Mbp. The QV of 38 indicates a fairly high base-level accuracy, although somewhat below the VGP target of 40 15 . Table 2 Assembly quality metrics.

A genome contact map generated using the PretextMap software ( https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextMap ) shows that all chromosomes have clean intra-chromosome signals, with minimal inter-chromosome interactions (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Genome-wide contact map of the curated primary assembly. K -mer spectra for the primary and alternate pseudohaplotypes were computed using the Merqury software version 1.0.0 29 . The spectra are clean, with many diploid regions shared between the two assemblies; however, there are still some homozygous areas missing from the alternate, which is to be expected. The plots do not indicate the presence of false duplicate k -mers in the primary assembly (Fig. 4 ). The primary spectra-cn (Fig. 4c ) shows that the primary assembly retains much of the heterozygous regions, but does not have any false duplicates. Accordingly, the alternate spectra-cn (Fig. 4d ) has a bump of read-only k -mers at haploid coverage, but these are the heterozygous regions that are present in the primary assembly, so they are not actually missing across the two pseudohaplotype assemblies. The primary assembly is the more complete of the two, containing both the homozygous regions as well as heterozygous variants (Fig. 4b ). Fig. 4 K-mer spectra generated using the Merqury software. ( a ) K-mer spectrum colored by k-mer copy number across the primary and alternate assembly. ( b ) K-mer spectrum colored by which assembly (if any) the k-mer is found in (assembly_01 is the primary, assembly_02 the alternate). ( c ) Primary assembly k-mer spectrum colored by copy number. ( d ) Alternate assembly k-mer spectrum colored by copy number. In addition to high contiguity and sufficient accuracy, the primary assembly is highly complete, having a BUSCO 62 , 63 % Complete score of 94.9 with Laurasiatheria database version 10. Comparison with other published genome assemblies within the same mammalian order To compare the quality of our genome assembly to other published assemblies of Eulipotyphla genomes, we used an R script 64 to retrieve and plot their quality metrics from the NCBI Assembly database. All of the other assemblies were based on short read technologies, with the exception of Talpa occidentalis (Iberian mole) 65 , which also used PacBio CLR, but not the VGP protocols for higher quality phasing, scaffolding, and curation. At the time of writing, our assembly was the most contiguous, having the highest contig N50 and scaffold N50 compared to the other assemblies. Contig N50 values of long-read-based assemblies tend to be orders of magnitude higher than those of short-read-based ones, as evidenced by Fig. 5a . For this study, this translated into having fewer fragmented genes as assessed by BUSCO 62 , 63 (Fig. 5b ). At the time of writing, BUSCO scores were only available for four Eulipotyphla genomes, of which ours had the highest % Complete and lowest % Fragmented score. The species and genome assembly versions included in this analysis are available on OSF 66 . Fig. 5 Quality metrics of Eulipotyphla genome assemblies reported by NCBI. The Etruscan shrew assembly is shown in red. ( a ) Contiguity. ( b ) Completeness, as measured by BUSCO scores. We also assessed the status of 18,430 ancestral genes in Eulipotyphla genomes that had pre-computed TOGA 22 results at the time of writing. Our assembly performed about average in terms of the number of intact ancestral open reading frames (ORFs) (Table 3 ). We had relatively few genes that had missing sequence, reflecting the high contiguity and completeness of our assembly. However, a relatively high number of ancestral genes had inactivating mutations: 2,405, compared to between 940 and 1,483 in other high-quality Eulipotyphla genomes. It is likely that many of these apparent mutations are really sequencing errors caused by the lower base-level accuracy of the version of PacBio technology used in this project compared to short read technologies, which could not be fully compensated for by polishing. Despite this issue, our assembly is of sufficiently high quality to serve as a useful reference for transcriptomics and most other purposes. The high contiguity, completeness, and thorough annotation make it a valuable resource for future studies of metabolism and development of one of the world’s smallest mammals.
