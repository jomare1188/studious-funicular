          "Next generation technologies have facilitated the application of phylogenomic approach even for non-model taxa ( Bossert and Danforth, 2018; Giribet, 2016; Wachi et al., 2018 ). Genomic data along with new phylogenetic approaches have allowed more accurate relationship inferences of even the most recalcitrant and highly diverse groups ( Jarvis et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2018 ). However, this process may be complicated when phylogenetic signals from different genomic regions are heterogeneous due to different combinations of biological processes such as recombination, interspecific gene flow, different patterns of genetic drift and selective pressures ( Li et al., 2019; Schumer et al., 2018 ). In species that diverged recently, or radiated rapidly, this phylogenetic inconsistency may be enhanced because species separate before they have had a chance to accumulate fixed new variants across many genomic regions leading to poorly resolved phylogenies with short internal branches and hard polytomies ( Giarla and Esselstyn, 2015 ).",
          "Rapid adaptive radiations are characterized by retention of shared ancestral variation and possible interspecific gene flow ( Berner and Salzburger, 2015 ), which may cause two major sources of gene tree discordance: incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression ( Degnan and Rosenberg, 2009 ). Though these two factors may obscure the underlying species relationships, several methods have been developed to accurately infer species history from genomic data, even under complex evolutionary scenarios ( Chifman and Kubatko, 2014; Mirarab and Warnow, 2015; Solís-Lemus and Ané, 2016; Yu and Nakhleh, 2015; Zhang et al., 2017 ). Phylogenomic studies have generally used two strategies to combine data derived from different parts of the genome: concatenation and multispecies coalescent model ( Bravo et al., 2019 ). Concatenating all data has the advantage of combining several regions with limited phylogenetic information to produce a single phylogeny, but is restricted by the premise that there is a single underlying evolutionary process, thus failing to consider the potential independence of gene histories, which, in some instances, may lead to misleading topologies ( de Queiroz and Gatesy, 2007; Edwards et al., 2007 ). Conversely, multispecies coalescent methods have been developed that summarize independently estimated gene trees into a species trees, which used to be very cumbersome and time-consuming, but new methods have been developed to streamline and speed up the process ( Liu et al., 2015 ). Most of these methods are very robust to ILS, but extensive gene flow can generate inconsistent results ( Solís-Lemus et al., 2016 ). In such cases, introgression events may be modeled in a species network as reticulated edges and associated with inheritance probability, that is the proportion of genes from the parental species transferred through the inferred reticulation event ( Yu et al., 2012 ). However, phylogenetic network reconstruction under maximum likelihood may be computationally prohibitive for large-scale datasets, though recent methods based on pseudo-maximum likelihood have been shown to be computationally less expensive and yet produce robust results ( Solís-Lemus and Ané, 2016; Yu and Nakhleh, 2015 ).",
          "We explored sources of tree discordances in species and lineages of Anastrepha Schiner (Diptera: Tephritidae), because it is a species-rich genus of fruit flies which includes several recently and rapidly diverged species, potentially rife with processes that interfere with phylogenetic signal. Anastrepha is the largest genus in the tribe Toxotrypanini with more than 300 valid species, which are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas ( Norrbom et al., 2018 ). Though there is clear morphological and behavioral (e.g. host preference and sexual activity) divergence among some Anastrepha species groups ( Aluja et al., 1999; Norrbom et al., 1999 ), phylogenetic analysis using the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and the nuclear period genes failed to establish robust relationships of these groups ( Barr et al., 2005; McPheron et al., 1999 ). In a formidable effort, Mengual et al. (2017) have recently analyzed six genes from 146 Anastrepha species which brought light onto a complex system, but failed to produce great support for the majority of the relationships among different groups, so much so that only seven species groups were found reciprocally monophyletic.",
          "We aim to investigate the ability of new methods to effectively identify evolutionary lineages and differentiation in taxa that diverged recently, even in the presence of gene flow, which appears to be the case of Anastrepha fruit flies. Considering that, we place a special focus on the Anastrepha fraterculus group, with 34 described species to date ( Norrbom et al., 2012 onwards), because it includes several recent diverged and widely distributed species in South America such as the A. fraterculus complex, and harbor some of the most important pest species in the Americas ( Aluja, 1994 ). Several closely related species in this group are hard to identify based on morphology due to overlapping variation even in the aculeus (structure inside the oviscape), which is a key trait in the systematics of this group ( Perre et al., 2014; Zucchi, 2000 ). Due to these attributes, it has been suggested that integrative taxonomy using a combination of morphological characters and genetic data may be helpful for species identification ( Schutze et al., 2017 ). However, molecular phylogenies have failed to show fully resolved phylogenetic relationships among the majority of these species, for instance, mtDNA phylogenies showed that most species in this group are not monophyletic, except Anastrepha suspensa ( Boykin et al., 2006; Scally et al., 2016; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001 ). In contrast, phylogenetic inferences based on nuclear markers displayed well-resolved phylogenies, and highlighted that an extensive sampling of A. obliqua has shown this species to be monophyletic ( Passos et al., 2018; Scally et al., 2016 ). The taxonomic uncertainties in the fraterculus group may also be due to complex evolutionary histories that includes retained shared ancestral polymorphism, hybridization and recent demographic expansion ( Díaz et al., 2018 ). Molecular phylogenies using few mitochondrial and nuclear genes have shown discordant topologies, which could suggest that these species retained signals of introgression ( Scally et al., 2016 ) and shared ancestral polymorphism due to a rapid diversification causing ILS ( Silva and Barr, 2008 ). Coalescent simulations using 20 nuclear genes of three closely related lineages reported recent population size expansions and speciation with gene flow ( Díaz et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, crosses in the laboratory have demonstrated that closely related species of this group may generate viable and fertile hybrids ( Rull et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2001 ), suggesting that hybridization in nature is possible, since many of these species are found in sympatry.",
          "An extreme example of the complexity of this group is the species A. fraterculus , which has been considered a species complex because of its large genetic and morphological variation and wide geographical distribution ( Selivon et al., 2005; Selivon et al., 2004; Stone, 1942 ). Morphological studies using samples throughout the Americas identified eight morphotypes in the A. fraterculus complex ( Hernández-Ortiz et al., 2015; Hernández-Ortiz et al., 2012 ). Several analyses using diverse data such as cytogenetics, genetics, morphometrics, pheromone composition and reproductive incompatibilities support at least three Brazilian lineages of A. fraterculus complex ( Břízová et al., 2013; Dias et al., 2016; Hernández-Ortiz et al., 2012; Manni et al., 2015; Rull et al., 2012; Selivon et al., 2005; Selivon et al., 2004 ), but differences among them are not so clear as for other lineages of the complex ( Hendrichs et al., 2015; Vaníčková et al., 2015 ), and different markers do not necessarily reach the same conclusions. Phylogenetic relationships among these lineages have remained unresolved, possibly because it is difficult to differentiate between intra- and inter-lineage variation in this complex.",
          "We generated female transcriptomes from some of the main pest species present in Brazil, with a special focus on the fraterculus group. This dataset was used to produce the first phylogenomic inference among some species of this genus, based on concatenation and multispecies coalescent methods. A combination of different strategies was considered to test for the impact of ILS and introgression events on phylogeny reconstruction. We also explore the tree space to identify biological processes associated with phylogenetic signals and compare gene trees and species topologies to measure the phylogenetic resolution of each gene. Our main goal is to develop a comprehensive workflow to seek phylogenetically informative genes, which may be useful to reconstruct reticulate evolutionary histories of different species of Anastrepha , in particular of the fraterculus group."

              "Our design aimed at sampling key Anastrepha species from the most economically important species groups, as well as a diverse array of species from the fraterculus group, with the main goal of obtaining a broad sample across the genus that would represent the breadth of the diversification in the genus, from more closely related populations to more distantly related species. For that we selected specific fruits that have previously been reported to be hosts of specific species such as Inga sp. to collect A. distincta , Cucurbita spp . (pumpkin) to collect A. grandis , Passiflora spp. (passion fruit) to collect A. pseudoparallela , Pouteria spp. (sapote) to collect A. serpentina , as well as several fleshy fruits, such as guava and starfruit, which are reportedly host to a wide array of species ( Zucchi and Moraes, 2008 ). Despite that, we collected only a limited number of species (~15% of the known species present in Brazil) ( Fig. 1 , Table S1 in Appendix D), due to the fact that several Anastrepha species, even from the fraterculus group species, are collected mostly from traps, having been found at very low local frequencies when sampled from fresh fruits. Since we chose to use only fresh specimens to perform RNA-seq experiments to standardize RNA quality, the use of flies from traps or previous collections would be inadequate.",
              "We used individuals that emerged from infested fruits collected from the field and kept in the lab (26 ± 5° C, 60–90% humidity and natural photoperiod). Fruits from different trees were individualized in trays with sterile vermiculite and their puparia were transferred to acrylic cages, until the emergence of females, which were immediately isolated. Virgin females 8–15 days old were individualized in microtubes, which were placed on ice for 5 to 10 min. The aculeus and wings were carefully removed and used for morphological identification by C.C. and R.A.Z. The reproductive tissues (ovaries, accessory glands, spermathecae and oviscape) were dissected and stored in 1.5 ml tubes with TRIzol® Reagent at −80 °C. RNA from female reproductive tissues was isolated using a TRIzol/chloroform protocol ( Chomczynski and Mackey, 1995 ) followed by a lithium chloride precipitation ( Cathala et al., 1983 ). To evaluate the purity of RNA samples, we estimated 260/230 and 260/280 ratios using a NanoVue™ spectrophotometer. The integrity of the samples was also visually verified in agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA-seq libraries of high-quality samples were prepared using the TruSeq® Stranded mRNA Sample Prep LS Protocol (Illumina®) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed using the HiSeq SBS v4 High Output Kit on Illumina HiSeq TM 2500 setting 2 × 125 bp (1/12 of lane per sample) or 2 × 100 bp (1/10 of lane per sample) paired-end reads cycles at the Laboratory of Functional Genomics Applied to Agriculture and Agri-energy, ESALQ-USP, Brazil. These data were combined with three A. fraterculus transcriptomes, one available on GenBank [ A. fraterculus TUC (SRR4026776)], another two from a separate study [ A. obliqua GO and A. fraterculus SP1 (Diaz et al. unpublished data)] and the Ceratitis capitata genome [GCF_000347755.2 ( Papanicolaou et al., 2016 )]. Even though some specimens were destroyed to extract RNA, for several we retained their aculei and wings, as well as voucher specimens from the same population, which are deposited at the DCBU collection (Coleção Entomológica do Departamento de Ecologia e Biologia Evolutiva da Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil)."

The final prediction of CDSs was performed by TransDecoder.Predict program. CDSs’ redundancy was reduced by similarity and by selecting the highest expressed isoform per potential unigene. We retained only one sequence per group of CDSs with highly similar (>0.99) using the CD-Hit program ( Fu et al., 2012 ). Transcripts containing this set of CDSs were filtered based on the highest expressed isoform per trinity component (potential unigene). For that, the reads were mapped to the respective assembly using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 ) and the abundances were estimated by eXpress v.1.5.1 ( Roberts and Pachter, 2013 ). These runs were carried out using the script align_and_estimate_abundance.pl included in the Trinity package, setting --very-sensitive option for Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 ), no bias correction for the eXpress program ( Roberts and Pachter, 2013 ) and default settings for the remaining parameters. The quality and completeness of the assemblies were assessed by BUSCO2 (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) ( Simão et al., 2015 ) using 1,066 single-copy orthologs of Arthropoda from OrthoDB ( Zdobnov et al., 2017 )."

              "Orthology prediction of putative CDSs was performed in a pipeline that uses a phylogenetic-based approach ( Yang and Smith, 2014 ). For that, The CDSs were submitted to all-by-all BLAST using NCBI BLASTN (2.6.0) ( Camacho et al., 2009 ) and filtered by MLC program ( van Dongen, 2000 ). Clusters of putative homologs were aligned using MAFFT v.7.305b ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 ), filtered by Phyutility v.2.2.6 ( Smith and Dunn, 2008 ) and then used to infer phylogenetic trees using RAxML v.8.2.9 ( Stamatakis, 2014 ). The phylogenetic trees were filtered by pruning tip and internal taxa with long branches using the scripts trim_tips.py and cut_long_internal_branches.py available on https://bitbucket.org/yangya/phylogenomic_dataset_construction . A maximum inclusion approach was used to infer the set of orthologs ( Dunn et al., 2013 ). We set up two sets of ortholog groups: i) including all Anastrepha sequences and using C. capitata as the outgroup, which we referred to as the Anastrepha ortholog set; ii) including only sequences from the fraterculus group, but using A. bistrigata as the outgroup, referred to as the fraterculus ortholog set. These two data sets were independently submitted to the POTION pipeline ( Hongo et al., 2015 ) considering different parameters (see Appendix B and Appendix C). This pipeline was used to re-align the sequences on each set based on amino acid using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 ) and then remove proteins with high variation in length and percent of identity. Moreover, the alignments were trimmed using the option strictplus in trimAl v.1.2 ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 ). Orthologs with signals of recombination detected by Phi, NSS or MaxChi2 methodologies implemented in PhiPack ( Bruen et al., 2006 ) were also removed. All parameters used in this pipeline are described in Appendix A. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies for each ortholog cluster were inferred using GTRCAT model and 200 rapid bootstrap replicates using maximum likelihood (ML) in the program RAxML v.8.2.9 ( Stamatakis, 2014 ).",

For that search, we compared unigenes from each sample against sequences obtained from the genome of A. fraterculus Andean morphotype (NC_034912) ( Isaza et al., 2017 ) and the Andean ITS1 lineages ( Sutton et al., 2015 ). The sequences identified based on the best hit criterium were aligned using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 ), manually trimmed, and used to infer phylogenetic relationships among Anastrepha samples based on these four mtDNA genes and among specimens from the fraterculus group using ITS1. We also included ITS1 sequences from previously identified A. fraterculus morphospecies ( Sutton et al., 2015 ). The phylogenetic inferences were performed using ML, 200 replicates of rapid bootstrap and GTRCAT model in the program RAxML v.8.2.9 ( Stamatakis, 2014 )."

We used a concatenation-based approach implemented on the IQ-TREE software v.1.7 ( Nguyen et al., 2014 ) and two coalescent-based approaches to estimate a species tree of the Anastrepha ortholog set: ASTRAL-III v.5.6.3 ( Zhang et al., 2017 ) and ASTRID ( Vachaspati and Warnow, 2015 ). IQ-TREE software generates a supermatrix from a set of alignments to infer the species tree. ASTRAL uses the quartet trees of the maximum likelihood phylogenies of each gene to produce the topology of the species tree and calculates the quartet support, which is the percentage of quartets that agree with a specific branch in the species tree. ASTRID also takes the gene trees to estimate internode distances and infer the species tree. This first topology derived from the Anastrepha ortholog set indicated A. bistrigata as the most adequate outgroup for a more detailed focus on species of the fraterculus group ( fraterculus ortholog set), so we inferred their species tree using a concatenation approach implemented in IQ-TREE software v.1.7 ( Nguyen et al., 2014 ) and three coalescent-based methodologies: ASTRAL-III v.5.6.3 ( Zhang et al., 2017 ), ASTRID ( Vachaspati and Warnow, 2015 ) and SVDquartets ( Chifman and Kubatko, 2014 ). Branches from ASTRAL input trees of both datasets with low support (bootstrap < 75) were removed using Newick utilities software ( Junier and Zdobnov, 2010 ), because this procedure was suggested to improve the accuracy of the inferred species tree ( Zhang et al., 2017 ). The SVDquartets is implemented in PAUP* v4.0a156 and uses the information of unlinked loci , such as SNPs. For that, the reads of each sample were mapped to the unigenes of A. bistrigata using --nofw and --very-sensitive options of Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 ). PCR duplicated reads were removed using MarkDuplicates tool included in the Picard package ( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ). The SNP calling was performed by mpileup tool of Samtools v.1.3.1 package ( Li et al., 2009 ) and mpileup2snp tool of VarScan v2.4.2 ( Koboldt et al., 2012 ). For that, we set the minimum mapping quality at 20, minimum PHRED average quality of 30, minimum coverage of 6 and strand filter (removed variants with >90% supported by only one strand). Bi-allelic SNPs detected in all of the samples (excluding sites with missing data) were used to build the SNṔs matrix as the input of SVDquartets + PAUP*. The tree was reconstructed using 100,000 quartets and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. We also calculated gene concordance factors (gCF) using the methodology proposed by Minh et al. (2018) implemented in the IQ-TREE software ( Nguyen et al., 2014 )."

We performed these tests in Abbababa2 tool ( Soraggi et al., 2018 ) implemented by ANGSD ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 ). Abbababa2 is a variant of the classic test that considers the possibility that there is more than one sample for each population in a dataset. ABBA-BABA test compares segregation of biallelic polymorphism of four samples (H1, H2, H3 and H4), being H1, H2 and H3 three ingroups and H4 an outgroup. Evidence of introgression was tested using the D statistics, which is calculated as the deviations of proportions of shared alleles between H2 and H3 (ABBA), and H1 and H3 (BABA) following the formula (nABBA-nBABA)/(nABBA + nBABA) ( Durand et al., 2011 ). We also used this program to perform a jack-knife approach to calculate a bias-corrected D statistics, D statistics variance and Z-test. For the latter test, p-values were corrected for multiple tests using the false discovery rate approach ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ).",

For that, we established a set of well-supported nodes, based on topology and taxonomy, in the species tree that defines what would be monophyletic lineages and their relationships. We used the percentage of well-supported nodes in each gene tree that agrees with the species tree’s topology as a measure of phylogenetic resolution. The percentage of resolved nodes of each gene was then contrasted with their mean bootstrap, overall branch length, level of introgression (average of D statistics) and evolutionary rates (ω, d N and d S )."

Three different clades were identified in the fraterculus group; the first included specimens from A. fraterculus , A. obliqua and A. turpiniae , the second included only individuals from A. fraterculus , and the third separated A. distincta . In contrast, a species tree based on 2,498 genes showed all nodes with high bootstrap values (>90%) and A. bistrigata from the striata group as sister lineage to the fraterculus group ( Fig. 2 B).

These species trees revealed that A. obliqua and A. turpiniae formed individual lineages and there were also three A. fraterculus lineages. There are also two strongly supported A. fraterculus clades, hereafter referred to as A. fraterculus C1, for the lineage that has ITS1 lineage TI/TIa, which is probably Anastrepha sp. 1 aff. fraterculus (Figure S5), and A. fraterculus C2, which formed a separate group related to ITS1 lineage TII ( Sutton et al., 2015 ), and a third, A. fraterculus C3 lineage composed of a single individual ( A. fraterculus SP3), which was positioned as a sister group of A. obliqua . We should mention that we are refraining from associating these A. fraterculus lineages to the putative species in the complex ( Selivon et al., 2005; Selivon et al., 2004 ), because those were mostly defined by morphometrical analyses which could not be performed on single individuals ( Hernández-Ortiz et al., 2012 )."

Networks with zero reticulations displayed the same topologies as the inferred species trees, even though they were inferred using a different methodology ( Fig. 4 ). All inferred species-networks with reticulations showed that reticulate edges have high inheritance probability (γ ≥ 0.2) ( Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 ). Moreover, the most likely networks showed two concordant reticulation edges and inheritance probability, which involved, at least, one internal branch ( Fig. 5 ). The Anastrepha dataset network also includes a reticulation with the ancestral branch of the fraterculus group and the ancestral lineage of A. serpentina and other lineages ( Fig. 5 A).

We used this information to explore the tree space, which revealed that CDSs in the 87.5 and 100% classes showed inferred topologies closer to the species tree topology ( Fig. 6 B).

              "The contrast of gene evolutionary patterns and different levels of phylogenetic resolution revealed that, on average, mean bootstrap and d N /d S ratio increased in genes with more phylogenetic resolution, whereas tree length decreased ( Fig. 7 ). The distribution of absolute D statistics is more complex, and shows a wider variance, but genes grouped in categories with 87.5 and 100% of nodes resolved displayed the lowest average D statistics absolute values. The higher average D statistics for genes from group with 100% of resolved nodes may be a reflex of the higher variance and smaller number of genes in this category, when compared to the class with 87.5% of phylogenetic resolution, which may be better seen when we factor out all species combinations (Figure S9 in Appendix D). The evolutionary rates reflect selective pressures, so genes with higher d N /d S are probably evolving, to some degree, under adaptive pressures. These box plots reveal that the d N /d S median gradually increased with the phylogenetic resolution. When this rate is decomposed, we observed that while the d N medians were similar across gene groups, increasing ever so slightly, the d S medians decreased as the phylogenetic resolution increased, which indicated that the higher ω in groups 8 and 9 was related to lower d S , rather than higher d N ( Fig. 7 E and 7F). Summarizing these findings, the genes with greater phylogenetic resolution (87.5% and 100%), have less variation mainly in synonymous substitutions and less signals of introgression.

          "The transcriptomes from female reproductive tissues of several Anastrepha species here produced have very similar quality, measured by standard metrics that report length distribution in de novo assemblies, such as average, median and N50, and comparable to what has been described in transcriptomes from A. obliqua and A. fraterculus ( Congrains et al., 2018; Rezende et al., 2016 ) and other Tephritidae species ( Salvemini et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2016 ). However, length distribution metrics like N50 may give a wrong idea of completeness, especially for transcriptome data, so we used BUSCO to evaluate the gene content of the assemblies. This program revealed that a very low percentage of conserved Arthropoda ortholog clusters were missing (<2.5%) or fragmented (<2.3%) in the raw transcriptomes. Furthermore, BUSCO was also useful to evaluate our efficiency to obtain unigenes, which produced low percentages of duplicates conserved orthologs (<1.35%) without greatly increasing missing orthologs (>4%). Since BUSCO was designed for genomic analyses, such a low rate of missing orthologs on transcriptomes, along with the high percentages of annotated CDSs, should be an indication of the high quality and completeness of the data and assembly here produced.",
          "The transcriptome data allowed us to infer thousands of ortholog groups across several species of Anastrepha which enabled us to reconstruct their evolutionary histories using mitochondrial and nuclear genes. mtDNA phylogeny based on four genes displayed poorly resolved relationships among Anastrepha species groups, which is a similar pattern found in previously published phylogenies using mtDNA or a very limited number of nuclear markers ( Barr et al., 2005; McPheron et al., 1999; Mengual et al., 2017; Silva and Barr, 2008 ). Moreover, the mtDNA inference also failed to resolve relationships among fraterculus group lineages, showing a large clade that included almost all lineages, except four individuals from A. fraterculus C1 (putatively Anastrepha sp. 1 aff. fraterculus ) and A. distincta , similar to what has been found on previous studies ( Ludeña et al., 2010; Scally et al., 2016; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001 ).",
          "In contrast, our genome-wide approach showed strong support for the species groups and their relationships, as well as different lineages that represent putatively separate species in the fraterculus group, which, in general, agree with the phylogenetic inference of Mengual et al. (2017) . Our results do not support the placement of A. bistrigata in the serpentina group, proposed by the combination of striata and serpentina groups ( Norrbom, 2002 ). This placement has already been disputed by karyotypic data ( Selivon et al., 2007 ) and by other molecular data, which actually placed A. bistrigata as a sister group to the fraterculus group ( Mengual et al., 2017; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001 ). In contrast to Mengual et al. (2017) , our results show A. grandis and A. pseudoparallela forming a clade, which is sister to the A. bistrigata and fraterculus group clade. Even though these branches have strong support, some are very short and may be affected by ancestral gene flow ( Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the phylogeny of the fraterculus group was in general similar to the inference published by Scally et al. (2016) , both showing strong support for the fraterculus group and their lineages. However, in that study, A. distincta was sister to the other fraterculus group species, whereas we found that species to have diverged recently and being closely related to A. turpiniae . These differences may be due to the smaller number of genes used in that study ( Scally et al., 2016 ), making it more likely to be affected by the high level of phylogenetic discordance among genes and the interspecific gene flow, which was also suggested by those authors. Furthermore, the phylogenetic inference in that study was based on concatenated genes which could be more sensitive to ILS and gene flow ( Kubatko and Degnan, 2007; Solís-Lemus et al., 2016 ). Though gene flow may obscure phylogenetic inferences ( Leaché et al., 2014 ), the fact that we inferred the same topology using diverse phylogenetic methodologies (concatenation and multi-species coalescent approaches), even when we allowed for introgression, suggests that there are different degrees of introgression across the genome and those lineages have evolved with some independence in certain genomic regions.",
          "The A. fraterculus group lineage is well supported in our analysis, as well as the relationships amongst species in the group, but we found the species A. fraterculus separated in three different lineages, which could agree with the suggestion that this species complex is composed of several cryptic species, three of them previously identified in Brazil (reviewed in Vaníčková et al., 2015 ). Even though there may be some markers that could be effective at separating these species, it has been suggested that only by applying integrative taxonomy across several populations and morphological attributes might we be able to effectively distinguishing these species and correctly assign individuals to those taxa ( Dias et al., 2016; Schutze et al., 2017 ). It has been proposed that the ITS1 region might be useful to separate some lineages in the A. fraterculus complex ( Sutton et al., 2015 ) and even help to identify species in the complex ( Prezotto et al., 2019 ). In our study, we could not recover ITS1 sequences from all individuals, but the phylogenetic analysis of this region displayed two different A. fraterculus clades that matched the species tree, suggesting that this region could indeed help to sort out the diversity of the fraterculus complex. On the other hand, the three morphometrically identified species suggested to occur in Brazil ( Selivon et al., 2005; Selivon et al., 2004 ) are all represented in a single ITS1 clade, referred to as TI/TIa in Sutton et al. (2015) and TIb/TIc/TId in Prezotto et al. (2019) , and are very closely related. The three A. fraterculus lineages we detected here could correspond to these putative species, but this does not look like to be the case, since one of these lineages shows ITS sequences that are more closely related to TII than to TI (Figure S5), and though we failed to recover the ITS sequence for A. fraterculus C3, in the multigene species tree this lineage was more closely related to A. obliqua . For that reason, and because we also detected high levels of introgression and ILS that would limit the ability of a single marker to make phylogenetic inferences, even the ITS1 gene, care should be exercised to identify species of the A. fraterculus complex across its distribution. Previous studies have suggested that the genetic structure of A. fraterculus lineages, even among Brazilian lineages, would be influenced by different selective pressures affecting populations at different altitudes ( Manni et al., 2015; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001 ). However, Anastrepha sp. 1 aff. fraterculus (possibly what we refer to as A. fraterculus C1) and A. fraterculus C2 lineages are widely and sympatrically distributed across Brazil without clear association to different altitudes or hosts, for that matter. Thus, the differentiation of these lineages may be caused by other factors than divergence in those ecological attributes, and may also be influenced by differential gene flow across their distribution. However, we still lack important information about host specificity or species distribution that could help us understand their differentiation ( Prezotto et al., 2019 ).",
          "Mito-nuclear discordance, ABBA-BABA tests and phylogenetic networks suggest a history of introgression in the evolution and divergence of the fraterculus group that extends to the Anastrepha genus. Gene flow among fraterculus group lineages has previously been reported ( Díaz et al., 2018; Scally et al., 2016 ), but this is the first study detecting introgression using genome scale datasets with samples from the species groups. Our results showed robust signals for introgression, producing D statistics values greater than 0.1 in ten combinations tested. These values are relatively high when compared to other insect genera with interspecific gene flow such as Heliconius ( Zhang et al., 2016 ) or Papilio ( Zhang et al., 2013 ) butterflies, but similar to what was reported for sibling mosquito species ( Fontaine et al., 2015 ), which may indicate that the signals are not only a reminiscent of older hybridization events.",
          "The evidence of introgression among species of the fraterculus group is supported by laboratory mating experiments that have shown possible hybrids among some A. fraterculus complex lineages ( Cáceres et al., 2009; Devescovi et al., 2014; Dias et al., 2016; Roriz et al., 2017; Rull et al., 2013; Vera et al., 2006 ), and even among more divergent species such as some lineages of A. fraterculus with A. obliqua and A. sororcula ( Rull et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2001 ). Even though these are forced crosses limited by space (cages) that show various levels of assortative mating (reviewed in Juárez et al., 2015 ) and reproductive isolation, it is possible that hybridization even between species still occurs in nature.",
          "In this study, we tried to tackle the diversification of the A. fraterculus complex by sampling from several localities across its distribution. Even though this sampling was still very limited, particularly because we only use a single specimen from each locality, we identified three lineages that could represent species within the complex that are reported in Brazil, though ITS1 sequences do not provide much support for that. Furthermore, we detected high levels of introgression between species in the fraterculus group, which involved A. fraterculus lineages, so much that species networks reveal that at least 30% of their genomes have been inherited from an alternative parent species ( Fig. 5 A and B). In this sense, we cannot rule out the possibility that A. fraterculus is in fact a species complex that still evolves as a paraphyletic unit, sharing several traits in common between diversifying lineages, that would show different levels of introgression across their genomes. Should that be the case, we would expect that the introgression level, and the parts of the genome involved, would vary across the species distribution, leading to a potential lack of congruence among different markers used on different populations, as shown in previous studies ( Barr et al., 2005; Prezotto et al., 2019; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001; Sutton et al., 2015 ).",
          "The indication of introgression, for instance from ABBA-BABA tests, among more distantly related species, such as species from distinct species groups, may be reminiscent of ancient introgression. D statistics among species from different Anastrepha groups were significant, but their values were much smaller than those reported among lineages in the fraterculus group, suggesting weaker signals of introgression. Since D statistics fails to discriminate between recent and ancestral pattern of introgression ( Durand et al., 2011; Ottenburghs et al., 2017 ) and the Anastrepha network showed a reticulation with high inheritance probablity (γ = 0.26) between ancestral branches of the species group ( Fig. 5 A), it is likely that some of those signals are remnants of ancestral events. These introgressed genes may be preferentially retained in genome regions with low recombination rates that are in linkage disequilibrium to genes involved in reproductive isolation or evolving under adaptive selection ( Schumer et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013 ). Besides, D statistics may result in false positive by recurrent mutations, especially in comparisons among more distantly related species, since bias in mutation rate are more likey to occur ( Durand et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, species from different Anastrepha groups are morphologically and ecologically distinct ( Norrbom et al., 1999 ), and there is no evidence of possible hybrids between them, which makes the hypothesis for ongoing gene flow between groups unlikely.",
          "One of the main challenges of studying lineages that diverged recently is that they may have experienced recent gene flow while still segregating ancestral polymorphism, which complicates phylogenetic inferences, as well as inferences of evolutionary forces shaping their diversity. To this matter, we separated genes into different classes, depending on how much congruence there was on eight pivotal nodes between their gene trees and the inferred species tree. We did so not only because all phylogenetic methods produced the same species tree, but also because its topology, in general, indicates species groups relationships that are compatible with what has been described, but also because it recovers all recognized species in the clade with robust support, as well as potential lineages in the A. fraterculus complex. Such strategy then allowed us to separate gene trees that were completely, or mostly, congruent with this putative species tree from others that failed, in different levels, to fully recover the species tree. Besides, the tree space analysis revealed that these genes evolved under particular degree of introgression and selection, suggesting that they do not recover the species tree topology by chance, but because they possibly evolved under similar underlying processes. Though, these features make them suitable candidates for being used as genetic markers to identify species across Anastrepha , further research including more lineages and individuals per lineages are needed to support this hypothesis.",
          "Our results show that average bootstrap values increase with phylogenetic resolution, an opposite trend from what we observed for overall tree length. This interesting result indicates that there is more support for nodes that were retained in the global species tree, which would be expected considering that there should be a higher congruence between gene trees and species trees when there is less ancestral polymorphism. Different evolutionary forces may influence gene tree discordance, such as drift or even a consequence of selection affecting these regions ( Degnan and Rosenberg, 2009 ). It is then interesting that even though the general pattern suggests a strong influence of purifying and background selection across all classes, reflected in the low overall d N /d S rates, there is an increase in the d N /d S ratio with the increase in phylogenetic resolution, albeit by a small amount. This could be explained, in part, by positive Darwinian selection ( Buschiazzo et al., 2012 ), relaxed selection ( Wertheim et al., 2015 ) or even purifying selection in conserved genes ( Wolf et al., 2009 ). Though we do not have evidence to completely discard any of them, we would expect that purifying selection would decrease d S along with d N with time. In a similar manner, drift should impact both estimates equally, but not necessarily by decreasing them. Since we detected a reduction in synonymous changes, but not on non-synonymous changes, coupled with shorter branch lengths, it seems that genes that are phylogenetically more informative would have a combination of purifying selection filtering genetic variation and positive selection favoring some non-synonymous changes, coupled with selective sweep that would reduce hitchhiking variation synonymous and non-synonymous. This pattern would also have an impact in the introgression of new genetic variation on these genes.",
          "By the way we defined phylogenic signal, one might consider a truism that regions whose gene trees would be more compatible with the overall species tree would show less introgression, since introgression tends to break phylogenetic resolution and it is inferred exactly from such deviations. Should that be the case, we would expect then that there would be a negative correlation between phylogenetic signal and introgression. We observe though that genes with low phylogenetic signal (classes from 0 to 25% of resolved nodes) displayed lower signals for introgression than genes with intermediate phylogenetic signal, suggesting a strong effect of ILS in those regions, reflected on the higher variance for these estimates ( Fig. 7 ). It is possible that in these cases, the amount of ILS is so high that it decreases the ability to detect introgression ( Eckert and Carstens, 2008 ). It is because of the confoundment between estimates of ancestral polymorphism and gene flow in these categories that we believe that groups of genes with more phylogenetic resolution (35.7 – 50% of resolved nodes) show higher levels of introgression, not necessarily because they introgress more readily. Even though then, in general, resistance to interspecific gene flow increases in genes whose evolutionary histories match the species tree, we see a small spike of introgression in the last category (100% of resolved nodes). That could be a reflex of positive selection and hybrid advantage in a few ecologically important genes, such as those reported for Heliconius ( The Heliconius Genome Consortium, 2012 ), though we cannot rule out that it could have been stochasticity, considering the smaller number of genes involved in that category.",
          "The phylogenetic history of Anastrepha species shows signals of recent rapid diversification, inferred by short internal branches and low resolution across several clades ( Mengual et al., 2017 ), some that may have diverged with gene flow. Rapid diversification may be strongly favored by introgression, especially because adaptive variation would be moved faster among diverging lineages than new advantageous mutations arise ( Mallet, 2007 ). Some of the most iconic and well-studied examples of rapid adaptive radiations involved the effect of introgression, such as mimicry pattern of Heliconius butterflies ( The Heliconius Genome Consortium, 2012 ), beak shape diversification of Darwin’s finches ( Lamichhaney et al., 2015 ) and vision patterns of cichlid fishes ( Meier et al., 2017 ). Races of another tephritid, the apple maggot Rhagoletis pomonella diverged rapidly with gene flow mainly due to host shifts preferences ( Feder et al., 2003 ). Though few Anastrepha species are strongly associated with their host plants ( Aluja, 1994 ), such as A. grandis , A. distincta or A. amita , some of the most important pest species, such as some from the fraterculus species group, are generalists. It is possible that generalist species, such as A fraterculus ( Zucchi and Moraes, 2008 ), might benefit from introgression of specialized genotypes to different hosts or habitats, which would be more geographically restricted, leading to genomic heterogeneity across the species distribution. In this scenario, generalist species might be even more influenced by introgression, especially if they are not reproductively isolated from the other species, and there is a potential for hybrid vigor that overrides hybrid breakdown ( Dagilis et al., 2019 ). Cross experiments between morphotypes of the A. fraterculus complex showed that hybrid females prefer to mate with hybrid males ( Segura et al., 2011 ), suggesting that hybridization and selection have played a key role in the diversification of these taxa."

          "Here we produced transcriptomes from reproductive tissues for 10 evolutionary lineages of Anastrepha , the majority of which are considered as major agricultural pests from South America and generated the first phylogeny based on genomic data for these important pests. Our approach enabled us to produce a high-quality cluster of orthologs which was used to accurately reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among these Anastrepha lineages applying concatenation and multispecies coalescent methods. Though we have a limited number of species here investigated, the high support, measured by gene concordance factors, bootstraps and quartet supports, point to a very robust phylogeny not only for deeper nodes of the Anastrepha genus, but for several lineages and putative species as well. The short internal nodes generally found even separating diverse species groups corroborates that this genus has diverged rapidly, as several other insect clades ( Magnacca and Price, 2015; Moest et al., 2020; Moore and Robertson, 2014 ), though with extensive signals for introgression especially among fraterculus lineages. Despite the high levels of ancestral polymorphism and introgression detected in most of the genome of species in the fraterculus group, our approach enabled us to reconstruct a robust phylogeny for the group, as well as identify a set of genes with high level of phylogenetic resolution, which may potentially be more effective in the grey zone between lineage separation and species divergence ( De Queiroz, 2007 ). Hence, these genes may have fixed or nearly fixed species specific variants, which would be useful for identifying economically important pest lineages, considering an integrated approach ( Schutze et al., 2017 ). Similar approaches may be applied to resolving phylogenetic relationship and underlying evolutionary forces affecting other recently diverged and potentially introgressed lineages."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Next generation technologies have facilitated the application of phylogenomic approach even for non-model taxa ( Bossert and Danforth, 2018; Giribet, 2016; Wachi et al., 2018 ). Genomic data along with new phylogenetic approaches have allowed more accurate relationship inferences of even the most recalcitrant and highly diverse groups ( Jarvis et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2018 ). However, this process may be complicated when phylogenetic signals from different genomic regions are heterogeneous due to different combinations of biological processes such as recombination, interspecific gene flow, different patterns of genetic drift and selective pressures ( Li et al., 2019; Schumer et al., 2018 ). In species that diverged recently, or radiated rapidly, this phylogenetic inconsistency may be enhanced because species separate before they have had a chance to accumulate fixed new variants across many genomic regions leading to poorly resolved phylogenies with short internal branches and hard polytomies ( Giarla and Esselstyn, 2015 ). Rapid adaptive radiations are characterized by retention of shared ancestral variation and possible interspecific gene flow ( Berner and Salzburger, 2015 ), which may cause two major sources of gene tree discordance: incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression ( Degnan and Rosenberg, 2009 ). Though these two factors may obscure the underlying species relationships, several methods have been developed to accurately infer species history from genomic data, even under complex evolutionary scenarios ( Chifman and Kubatko, 2014; Mirarab and Warnow, 2015; Solís-Lemus and Ané, 2016; Yu and Nakhleh, 2015; Zhang et al., 2017 ). Phylogenomic studies have generally used two strategies to combine data derived from different parts of the genome: concatenation and multispecies coalescent model ( Bravo et al., 2019 ). Concatenating all data has the advantage of combining several regions with limited phylogenetic information to produce a single phylogeny, but is restricted by the premise that there is a single underlying evolutionary process, thus failing to consider the potential independence of gene histories, which, in some instances, may lead to misleading topologies ( de Queiroz and Gatesy, 2007; Edwards et al., 2007 ). Conversely, multispecies coalescent methods have been developed that summarize independently estimated gene trees into a species trees, which used to be very cumbersome and time-consuming, but new methods have been developed to streamline and speed up the process ( Liu et al., 2015 ). Most of these methods are very robust to ILS, but extensive gene flow can generate inconsistent results ( Solís-Lemus et al., 2016 ). In such cases, introgression events may be modeled in a species network as reticulated edges and associated with inheritance probability, that is the proportion of genes from the parental species transferred through the inferred reticulation event ( Yu et al., 2012 ). However, phylogenetic network reconstruction under maximum likelihood may be computationally prohibitive for large-scale datasets, though recent methods based on pseudo-maximum likelihood have been shown to be computationally less expensive and yet produce robust results ( Solís-Lemus and Ané, 2016; Yu and Nakhleh, 2015 ). We explored sources of tree discordances in species and lineages of Anastrepha Schiner (Diptera: Tephritidae), because it is a species-rich genus of fruit flies which includes several recently and rapidly diverged species, potentially rife with processes that interfere with phylogenetic signal. Anastrepha is the largest genus in the tribe Toxotrypanini with more than 300 valid species, which are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas ( Norrbom et al., 2018 ). Though there is clear morphological and behavioral (e.g. host preference and sexual activity) divergence among some Anastrepha species groups ( Aluja et al., 1999; Norrbom et al., 1999 ), phylogenetic analysis using the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and the nuclear period genes failed to establish robust relationships of these groups ( Barr et al., 2005; McPheron et al., 1999 ). In a formidable effort, Mengual et al. (2017) have recently analyzed six genes from 146 Anastrepha species which brought light onto a complex system, but failed to produce great support for the majority of the relationships among different groups, so much so that only seven species groups were found reciprocally monophyletic. We aim to investigate the ability of new methods to effectively identify evolutionary lineages and differentiation in taxa that diverged recently, even in the presence of gene flow, which appears to be the case of Anastrepha fruit flies. Considering that, we place a special focus on the Anastrepha fraterculus group, with 34 described species to date ( Norrbom et al., 2012 onwards), because it includes several recent diverged and widely distributed species in South America such as the A. fraterculus complex, and harbor some of the most important pest species in the Americas ( Aluja, 1994 ). Several closely related species in this group are hard to identify based on morphology due to overlapping variation even in the aculeus (structure inside the oviscape), which is a key trait in the systematics of this group ( Perre et al., 2014; Zucchi, 2000 ). Due to these attributes, it has been suggested that integrative taxonomy using a combination of morphological characters and genetic data may be helpful for species identification ( Schutze et al., 2017 ). However, molecular phylogenies have failed to show fully resolved phylogenetic relationships among the majority of these species, for instance, mtDNA phylogenies showed that most species in this group are not monophyletic, except Anastrepha suspensa ( Boykin et al., 2006; Scally et al., 2016; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001 ). In contrast, phylogenetic inferences based on nuclear markers displayed well-resolved phylogenies, and highlighted that an extensive sampling of A. obliqua has shown this species to be monophyletic ( Passos et al., 2018; Scally et al., 2016 ). The taxonomic uncertainties in the fraterculus group may also be due to complex evolutionary histories that includes retained shared ancestral polymorphism, hybridization and recent demographic expansion ( Díaz et al., 2018 ). Molecular phylogenies using few mitochondrial and nuclear genes have shown discordant topologies, which could suggest that these species retained signals of introgression ( Scally et al., 2016 ) and shared ancestral polymorphism due to a rapid diversification causing ILS ( Silva and Barr, 2008 ). Coalescent simulations using 20 nuclear genes of three closely related lineages reported recent population size expansions and speciation with gene flow ( Díaz et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, crosses in the laboratory have demonstrated that closely related species of this group may generate viable and fertile hybrids ( Rull et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2001 ), suggesting that hybridization in nature is possible, since many of these species are found in sympatry. An extreme example of the complexity of this group is the species A. fraterculus , which has been considered a species complex because of its large genetic and morphological variation and wide geographical distribution ( Selivon et al., 2005; Selivon et al., 2004; Stone, 1942 ). Morphological studies using samples throughout the Americas identified eight morphotypes in the A. fraterculus complex ( Hernández-Ortiz et al., 2015; Hernández-Ortiz et al., 2012 ). Several analyses using diverse data such as cytogenetics, genetics, morphometrics, pheromone composition and reproductive incompatibilities support at least three Brazilian lineages of A. fraterculus complex ( Břízová et al., 2013; Dias et al., 2016; Hernández-Ortiz et al., 2012; Manni et al., 2015; Rull et al., 2012; Selivon et al., 2005; Selivon et al., 2004 ), but differences among them are not so clear as for other lineages of the complex ( Hendrichs et al., 2015; Vaníčková et al., 2015 ), and different markers do not necessarily reach the same conclusions. Phylogenetic relationships among these lineages have remained unresolved, possibly because it is difficult to differentiate between intra- and inter-lineage variation in this complex. We generated female transcriptomes from some of the main pest species present in Brazil, with a special focus on the fraterculus group. This dataset was used to produce the first phylogenomic inference among some species of this genus, based on concatenation and multispecies coalescent methods. A combination of different strategies was considered to test for the impact of ILS and introgression events on phylogeny reconstruction. We also explore the tree space to identify biological processes associated with phylogenetic signals and compare gene trees and species topologies to measure the phylogenetic resolution of each gene. Our main goal is to develop a comprehensive workflow to seek phylogenetically informative genes, which may be useful to reconstruct reticulate evolutionary histories of different species of Anastrepha , in particular of the fraterculus group. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Sampling and laboratory procedures Our design aimed at sampling key Anastrepha species from the most economically important species groups, as well as a diverse array of species from the fraterculus group, with the main goal of obtaining a broad sample across the genus that would represent the breadth of the diversification in the genus, from more closely related populations to more distantly related species. For that we selected specific fruits that have previously been reported to be hosts of specific species such as Inga sp. to collect A. distincta , Cucurbita spp . (pumpkin) to collect A. grandis , Passiflora spp. (passion fruit) to collect A. pseudoparallela , Pouteria spp. (sapote) to collect A. serpentina , as well as several fleshy fruits, such as guava and starfruit, which are reportedly host to a wide array of species ( Zucchi and Moraes, 2008 ). Despite that, we collected only a limited number of species (~15% of the known species present in Brazil) ( Fig. 1 , Table S1 in Appendix D), due to the fact that several Anastrepha species, even from the fraterculus group species, are collected mostly from traps, having been found at very low local frequencies when sampled from fresh fruits. Since we chose to use only fresh specimens to perform RNA-seq experiments to standardize RNA quality, the use of flies from traps or previous collections would be inadequate. We used individuals that emerged from infested fruits collected from the field and kept in the lab (26 ± 5° C, 60–90% humidity and natural photoperiod). Fruits from different trees were individualized in trays with sterile vermiculite and their puparia were transferred to acrylic cages, until the emergence of females, which were immediately isolated. Virgin females 8–15 days old were individualized in microtubes, which were placed on ice for 5 to 10 min. The aculeus and wings were carefully removed and used for morphological identification by C.C. and R.A.Z. The reproductive tissues (ovaries, accessory glands, spermathecae and oviscape) were dissected and stored in 1.5 ml tubes with TRIzol® Reagent at −80 °C. RNA from female reproductive tissues was isolated using a TRIzol/chloroform protocol ( Chomczynski and Mackey, 1995 ) followed by a lithium chloride precipitation ( Cathala et al., 1983 ). To evaluate the purity of RNA samples, we estimated 260/230 and 260/280 ratios using a NanoVue™ spectrophotometer. The integrity of the samples was also visually verified in agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA-seq libraries of high-quality samples were prepared using the TruSeq® Stranded mRNA Sample Prep LS Protocol (Illumina®) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed using the HiSeq SBS v4 High Output Kit on Illumina HiSeq TM 2500 setting 2 × 125 bp (1/12 of lane per sample) or 2 × 100 bp (1/10 of lane per sample) paired-end reads cycles at the Laboratory of Functional Genomics Applied to Agriculture and Agri-energy, ESALQ-USP, Brazil. These data were combined with three A. fraterculus transcriptomes, one available on GenBank [ A. fraterculus TUC (SRR4026776)], another two from a separate study [ A. obliqua GO and A. fraterculus SP1 (Diaz et al. unpublished data)] and the Ceratitis capitata genome [GCF_000347755.2 ( Papanicolaou et al., 2016 )]. Even though some specimens were destroyed to extract RNA, for several we retained their aculei and wings, as well as voucher specimens from the same population, which are deposited at the DCBU collection (Coleção Entomológica do Departamento de Ecologia e Biologia Evolutiva da Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil). 2.2 Cleaning, de novo assembly and unigene prediction The reads from each library were trimmed based on PHRED quality score and TrueSeq Illumina adapters were removed using the program Trimmomatic v. 0.35 ( Bolger et al., 2014 ) (see parameters in the Appendix A). Filtered pair-end reads were normalized by k-mer counting and assembled setting -SS_lib_type RF for stranded samples and default parameters on Trinity package v. 2.3.2 ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ). The putative coding sequences (CDSs) for each library were predicted using TransDecoder v. 3.0.1 ( Grabherr et al., 2011 ). We inferred the longest CDSs using TransDecoder.LongOrfs, which were annotated against Pfam and Unitprot90 databases using HMMER v. 3.1b2 hmmscan ( Eddy, 2011 ) and NCBI BLASTP (2.6.0) ( Camacho et al., 2009 ), respectively. The final prediction of CDSs was performed by TransDecoder.Predict program. CDSs’ redundancy was reduced by similarity and by selecting the highest expressed isoform per potential unigene. We retained only one sequence per group of CDSs with highly similar (>0.99) using the CD-Hit program ( Fu et al., 2012 ). Transcripts containing this set of CDSs were filtered based on the highest expressed isoform per trinity component (potential unigene). For that, the reads were mapped to the respective assembly using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 ) and the abundances were estimated by eXpress v.1.5.1 ( Roberts and Pachter, 2013 ). These runs were carried out using the script align_and_estimate_abundance.pl included in the Trinity package, setting --very-sensitive option for Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 ), no bias correction for the eXpress program ( Roberts and Pachter, 2013 ) and default settings for the remaining parameters. The quality and completeness of the assemblies were assessed by BUSCO2 (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) ( Simão et al., 2015 ) using 1,066 single-copy orthologs of Arthropoda from OrthoDB ( Zdobnov et al., 2017 ). 2.3 Functional annotation We used NCBI BLASTP (2.6.0) to align the translated putative CDSs against the non-redundant protein database of Arthropoda from Genbank (nr), the Drosophila melanogaster protein database (r6.14) and the Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups of proteins database (KOG) ( Koonin et al., 2004 ). Hits with e-value lower than 10 -6 were considered as significant. Conserved protein domains were searched using InterProScan v. 5.23–62.0 ( Jones et al., 2014 ). Blast2GO program ( Conesa et al., 2005 ) was used to associate each annotated transcript with gene ontology (GO) terms. 2.4 Orthology inference and phylogenetic analysis Orthology prediction of putative CDSs was performed in a pipeline that uses a phylogenetic-based approach ( Yang and Smith, 2014 ). For that, The CDSs were submitted to all-by-all BLAST using NCBI BLASTN (2.6.0) ( Camacho et al., 2009 ) and filtered by MLC program ( van Dongen, 2000 ). Clusters of putative homologs were aligned using MAFFT v.7.305b ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 ), filtered by Phyutility v.2.2.6 ( Smith and Dunn, 2008 ) and then used to infer phylogenetic trees using RAxML v.8.2.9 ( Stamatakis, 2014 ). The phylogenetic trees were filtered by pruning tip and internal taxa with long branches using the scripts trim_tips.py and cut_long_internal_branches.py available on https://bitbucket.org/yangya/phylogenomic_dataset_construction . A maximum inclusion approach was used to infer the set of orthologs ( Dunn et al., 2013 ). We set up two sets of ortholog groups: i) including all Anastrepha sequences and using C. capitata as the outgroup, which we referred to as the Anastrepha ortholog set; ii) including only sequences from the fraterculus group, but using A. bistrigata as the outgroup, referred to as the fraterculus ortholog set. These two data sets were independently submitted to the POTION pipeline ( Hongo et al., 2015 ) considering different parameters (see Appendix B and Appendix C). This pipeline was used to re-align the sequences on each set based on amino acid using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 ) and then remove proteins with high variation in length and percent of identity. Moreover, the alignments were trimmed using the option strictplus in trimAl v.1.2 ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 ). Orthologs with signals of recombination detected by Phi, NSS or MaxChi2 methodologies implemented in PhiPack ( Bruen et al., 2006 ) were also removed. All parameters used in this pipeline are described in Appendix A. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies for each ortholog cluster were inferred using GTRCAT model and 200 rapid bootstrap replicates using maximum likelihood (ML) in the program RAxML v.8.2.9 ( Stamatakis, 2014 ). We reconstructed mtDNA and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) phylogenies to compare them to previously published species tree and phylogenies. We sought four mitochondrial genes [Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), Cytochrome b (cytB), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5)] and ITS1 in the transcriptomes using BLASTn. For that search, we compared unigenes from each sample against sequences obtained from the genome of A. fraterculus Andean morphotype (NC_034912) ( Isaza et al., 2017 ) and the Andean ITS1 lineages ( Sutton et al., 2015 ). The sequences identified based on the best hit criterium were aligned using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 ), manually trimmed, and used to infer phylogenetic relationships among Anastrepha samples based on these four mtDNA genes and among specimens from the fraterculus group using ITS1. We also included ITS1 sequences from previously identified A. fraterculus morphospecies ( Sutton et al., 2015 ). The phylogenetic inferences were performed using ML, 200 replicates of rapid bootstrap and GTRCAT model in the program RAxML v.8.2.9 ( Stamatakis, 2014 ). 2.5 Calculate evolutionary rates We estimated the global non-synonymous to synonymous rate (d N /d S ) ratio (ω) on clusters of orthologs from the fraterculus ortholog set, using the model m0 of the program CODEML included in PAML package ( Yang, 2007 ). d N /d S is a measure of selective pressure acting on a gene, such that genes displaying higher rates of d N over d S (d N /d S > 1) have probably evolved under positive selection, in contrast, genes with greater d S relative to d N , have probably evolved under purifying selection (e.g. d N /d S < 1), whereas genes that evolved under neutrality would have d N /d S close to 1. 2.6 Species tree inference We used the contigs from the Anastrepha ortholog set for analyses of broader relationship among species of Anastrepha and C. capitata , while the fraterculus ortholog set encompassed only species from the fraterculus group lineages and used A. bistrigata as an outgroup. We used a concatenation-based approach implemented on the IQ-TREE software v.1.7 ( Nguyen et al., 2014 ) and two coalescent-based approaches to estimate a species tree of the Anastrepha ortholog set: ASTRAL-III v.5.6.3 ( Zhang et al., 2017 ) and ASTRID ( Vachaspati and Warnow, 2015 ). IQ-TREE software generates a supermatrix from a set of alignments to infer the species tree. ASTRAL uses the quartet trees of the maximum likelihood phylogenies of each gene to produce the topology of the species tree and calculates the quartet support, which is the percentage of quartets that agree with a specific branch in the species tree. ASTRID also takes the gene trees to estimate internode distances and infer the species tree. This first topology derived from the Anastrepha ortholog set indicated A. bistrigata as the most adequate outgroup for a more detailed focus on species of the fraterculus group ( fraterculus ortholog set), so we inferred their species tree using a concatenation approach implemented in IQ-TREE software v.1.7 ( Nguyen et al., 2014 ) and three coalescent-based methodologies: ASTRAL-III v.5.6.3 ( Zhang et al., 2017 ), ASTRID ( Vachaspati and Warnow, 2015 ) and SVDquartets ( Chifman and Kubatko, 2014 ). Branches from ASTRAL input trees of both datasets with low support (bootstrap < 75) were removed using Newick utilities software ( Junier and Zdobnov, 2010 ), because this procedure was suggested to improve the accuracy of the inferred species tree ( Zhang et al., 2017 ). The SVDquartets is implemented in PAUP* v4.0a156 and uses the information of unlinked loci , such as SNPs. For that, the reads of each sample were mapped to the unigenes of A. bistrigata using --nofw and --very-sensitive options of Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 ). PCR duplicated reads were removed using MarkDuplicates tool included in the Picard package ( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ). The SNP calling was performed by mpileup tool of Samtools v.1.3.1 package ( Li et al., 2009 ) and mpileup2snp tool of VarScan v2.4.2 ( Koboldt et al., 2012 ). For that, we set the minimum mapping quality at 20, minimum PHRED average quality of 30, minimum coverage of 6 and strand filter (removed variants with >90% supported by only one strand). Bi-allelic SNPs detected in all of the samples (excluding sites with missing data) were used to build the SNṔs matrix as the input of SVDquartets + PAUP*. The tree was reconstructed using 100,000 quartets and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. We also calculated gene concordance factors (gCF) using the methodology proposed by Minh et al. (2018) implemented in the IQ-TREE software ( Nguyen et al., 2014 ). 2.7 Introgression detection To test for hybridization signals among the Anastrepha lineages, we performed ABBA-BABA tests ( Patterson et al., 2012 ) using two data sets, one which included all samples, using A. serpentina as outgroup and mapping reference, and a subset with only A. fraterculus group samples, but using A. serpentina and A. bistrigata , each one separately as outgroup and mapping reference. We performed these tests in Abbababa2 tool ( Soraggi et al., 2018 ) implemented by ANGSD ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 ). Abbababa2 is a variant of the classic test that considers the possibility that there is more than one sample for each population in a dataset. ABBA-BABA test compares segregation of biallelic polymorphism of four samples (H1, H2, H3 and H4), being H1, H2 and H3 three ingroups and H4 an outgroup. Evidence of introgression was tested using the D statistics, which is calculated as the deviations of proportions of shared alleles between H2 and H3 (ABBA), and H1 and H3 (BABA) following the formula (nABBA-nBABA)/(nABBA + nBABA) ( Durand et al., 2011 ). We also used this program to perform a jack-knife approach to calculate a bias-corrected D statistics, D statistics variance and Z-test. For the latter test, p-values were corrected for multiple tests using the false discovery rate approach ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ). Since we found evidence of interspecific gene flow among Anastrepha lineages, we inferred phylogenetic networks to detect possible events of hybridization, which are visualized as reticulation in the network ( Huson and Scornavacca, 2011; Yu et al., 2012 ). The phylogenetic networks were inferred from 2,498 CDSs in the Anastrepha ortholog set and 3,811 CDSs in the fraterculus group ortholog set using pseudo-maximum likelihood approach ( Yu and Nakhleh, 2015 ) implemented in PHYLONET v. 3.6.1 ( Than et al., 2008 ). This program estimates the network topology and inheritance probability (γ), which is the hybridization probability considering the two parent population ( Yu et al., 2012 ). We built six networks varying the number of reticulations from 0 to 5 and setting the taxa association using the species tree topology. The optimal network of each run was selected based on the highest log pseudo-likelihood after 500 searches. The log pseudo-likelihood of the best network for each run was also compared to choose the optimum number of reticulations in the network of each dataset. The networks were plotted using the software PhyloNetworks ( Solís-Lemus et al., 2017 ). 2.8 Gene tree and species tree discordance We explored the degree of incongruence among gene and species tree topologies of fraterculus ortholog set using two approaches. First, we produced a Densitree plot to visualize phylogenetic discordance among gene trees. For that, ML trees were rooted using A. bistrigata as outgroup and converted to ultrametric trees using Phytools ( Revell, 2012 ) and chronos function implemented in APE module ( Paradis et al., 2004 ) in R v.3.6.1 ( R Core Team, 2019 ). These trees were submitted to DensiTree ( Bouckaert, 2010 ) setting the option star tree to produce the density tree. Second, we performed a multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach using a matrix of pairwise distances between gene trees and species tree ( Duchêne et al., 2018 ). Distances between tree topologies were calculated using unweighted Robinson-Foulds pairwise distance through the function RF.dist implemented in Phangorn ( Schliep, 2010 ) module in R v.3.6.1. 2.9 Phylogenetically informative markers We used a custom Python script (available at https://github.com/carloscongrains/phylogenetic_resolution ) to compare the internal topology of each gene tree inferred from the fraterculus ortholog set against the inferred species tree to estimate the congruence between them by calculating how many lineages that are resolved in the former that agrees with the latter. For that, we established a set of well-supported nodes, based on topology and taxonomy, in the species tree that defines what would be monophyletic lineages and their relationships. We used the percentage of well-supported nodes in each gene tree that agrees with the species tree’s topology as a measure of phylogenetic resolution. The percentage of resolved nodes of each gene was then contrasted with their mean bootstrap, overall branch length, level of introgression (average of D statistics) and evolutionary rates (ω, d N and d S ). 3 Results 3.1 Sequencing and assembly The transcriptome libraries had an average of 21.6 (±2.5) × 2 million of raw reads. The filtering step removed an average of 6.7% of the reads, retaining an average of 20.3 (±2.4) millions of pair-end reads (Table S2 in Appendix D). The de novo assemblies produced >55,000 contigs per sample with N50 ranging from 1,466 to 2,524 nt with an average of 1,968 nt (Table S3 in Appendix D). Furthermore, the quality assessment revealed that ~ 97% of Arthropoda ortholog clusters in BUSCO were found to be complete in the assemblies, but with high levels of redundancy (31% of duplicates, on average) (Table S4 in Appendix D). In contrast, unigenes showed almost the same rate of complete orthologs, but the duplicated rates were drastically reduced (~1% of duplicates) (Table S4 in Appendix D). BLAST searches showed a high percent of unigenes with significant hits; depending on the assembly, at least 75% were annotated with the D. melanogaster protein database and 92% with nr Genbank Arthropoda database (Table S5 in Appendix D). Likewise, on average, 91% (ranging from 87 and 93%) and 71% (with a range of 67–73%) of the unigene CDSs were annotated using Interproscan and Blast2GO, respectively (Table S5 in Appendix D). Furthermore, the functional annotation revealed similar distribution of GO terms and KOG categories for each Anastrepha lineages (Figure S1 and Figure S2 in Appendix D). 3.2 Phylogenomic inference mtDNA maximum likelihood phylogeny showed few clades with a robust support, among them the monophyly of the fraterculus group and its close relationship to A. pseudoparallela ( Fig. 2 A). Three different clades were identified in the fraterculus group; the first included specimens from A. fraterculus , A. obliqua and A. turpiniae , the second included only individuals from A. fraterculus , and the third separated A. distincta . In contrast, a species tree based on 2,498 genes showed all nodes with high bootstrap values (>90%) and A. bistrigata from the striata group as sister lineage to the fraterculus group ( Fig. 2 B). The relationships among fraterculus group lineages inferred by nuclear genes were the same, regardless of the dataset ( Anastrepha or fraterculus ortholog set) and methodology (concatenation or multispecies coalescent-based approach) ( Fig. 2 B, Figure S3, Fig. 3 A and Figure S4), but as SVDquartets + PAUP* methodology was performed using biallelic data, relationships within lineages were not comparable. These species trees revealed that A. obliqua and A. turpiniae formed individual lineages and there were also three A. fraterculus lineages. There are also two strongly supported A. fraterculus clades, hereafter referred to as A. fraterculus C1, for the lineage that has ITS1 lineage TI/TIa, which is probably Anastrepha sp. 1 aff. fraterculus (Figure S5), and A. fraterculus C2, which formed a separate group related to ITS1 lineage TII ( Sutton et al., 2015 ), and a third, A. fraterculus C3 lineage composed of a single individual ( A. fraterculus SP3), which was positioned as a sister group of A. obliqua . We should mention that we are refraining from associating these A. fraterculus lineages to the putative species in the complex ( Selivon et al., 2005; Selivon et al., 2004 ), because those were mostly defined by morphometrical analyses which could not be performed on single individuals ( Hernández-Ortiz et al., 2012 ). 3.3 Detection of introgression among Anastrepha lineages ABBA-BABA tests for all possible triplet combinations among fraterculus lineages derived from the species tree topology showed signals for introgression in almost all combinations using A. bistrigata or A. serpentina as independent outgroups ( Table 1 and Table S6 in Appendix D). Only two ingroups failed to show significant introgression in both references, both of which involved A. distincta . Furthermore, D statistics calculated using these two outgroups were strongly correlated (Pearson's correlation: p < 2.2e -16 , R = 0.997). Likewise, comparisons among lineages from different Anastrepha species groups revealed that all possible combinations displayed statistically significant ABBA-BABA tests, which may indicate introgression even between distantly related lineages ( Table 2 ). Moreover, ABBA-BABA tests that involved two lineages from the fraterculus group (as H1 and H2) and one from another species group had 14 out of 45 (31.1%) combinations with signals of introgression (Table S7 in Appendix D). There is an increase in the log pseudo-likelihood with higher number of reticulations inferred for both datasets inferred by PHYLONET, but since they showed a plateau starting at three reticulations for the Anastrepha ortholog set and two reticulations for the fraterculus ortholog set, we retained these as optimal values (Figure S6 in Appendix D). Networks with zero reticulations displayed the same topologies as the inferred species trees, even though they were inferred using a different methodology ( Fig. 4 ). All inferred species-networks with reticulations showed that reticulate edges have high inheritance probability (γ ≥ 0.2) ( Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 ). Moreover, the most likely networks showed two concordant reticulation edges and inheritance probability, which involved, at least, one internal branch ( Fig. 5 ). The Anastrepha dataset network also includes a reticulation with the ancestral branch of the fraterculus group and the ancestral lineage of A. serpentina and other lineages ( Fig. 5 A). Besides, both optimum networks retained the species tree topology inferred from methods that do not take into account introgression as a major source of gene trees discordance. 3.4 Gene tree and species tree discordance Levels of incongruence between gene trees and species tree measured by quartets support, gene concordance factor and density tree plot ( Fig. 2 B and Fig. 3 ), indicated strong signals of gene tree discordance ( Fig. 3 B), but robust support for clades corresponding to A. obliqua , A. turpiniae , A. fraterculus C1 and A. fraterculus C2. In contrast, relationships between groups showed lower supports, such as the separation between A. grandis and A. pseudoparallela , or the separation between A. fraterculus C2, A. turpiniae and A. distincta from A. fraterculus C1. We used eight nodes in the species tree to determine the level of phylogenetic resolution in terms of percentage of these nodes that were resolved in each gene tree (these nodes can be seen on Fig. 6 A) . CDSs of fraterculus ortholog set were grouped into nine classes (Figure S7). We used this information to explore the tree space, which revealed that CDSs in the 87.5 and 100% classes showed inferred topologies closer to the species tree topology ( Fig. 6 B). We also observed that genes from those classes displayed greater gene concordance factors and smaller signals of introgression (Figure S7A and Figure S7B in Appendix D). In general, the tree space analysis showed that the first component of MDS was strongly associated with the evaluated parameters, specifically mean bootstraps and evolutionary rates (d N /d S ) showed significant direct association and overall tree length, GC content and synonymous rate (d S ) showed significant inverse association (Figure S7 in Appendix D). Taking into account the position of the species tree topology in the MDS gene tree space, we would expect that larger mean bootstrap values and evolutionary rate would show greater phylogenetic resolution, and inverse association with overall tree length, GC content and d S . 3.5 Phylogenetically informative markers The contrast of gene evolutionary patterns and different levels of phylogenetic resolution revealed that, on average, mean bootstrap and d N /d S ratio increased in genes with more phylogenetic resolution, whereas tree length decreased ( Fig. 7 ). The distribution of absolute D statistics is more complex, and shows a wider variance, but genes grouped in categories with 87.5 and 100% of nodes resolved displayed the lowest average D statistics absolute values. The higher average D statistics for genes from group with 100% of resolved nodes may be a reflex of the higher variance and smaller number of genes in this category, when compared to the class with 87.5% of phylogenetic resolution, which may be better seen when we factor out all species combinations (Figure S9 in Appendix D). The evolutionary rates reflect selective pressures, so genes with higher d N /d S are probably evolving, to some degree, under adaptive pressures. These box plots reveal that the d N /d S median gradually increased with the phylogenetic resolution. When this rate is decomposed, we observed that while the d N medians were similar across gene groups, increasing ever so slightly, the d S medians decreased as the phylogenetic resolution increased, which indicated that the higher ω in groups 8 and 9 was related to lower d S , rather than higher d N ( Fig. 7 E and 7F). Summarizing these findings, the genes with greater phylogenetic resolution (87.5% and 100%), have less variation mainly in synonymous substitutions and less signals of introgression. These set of genes are available at Appendix E. 4 Discussion The transcriptomes from female reproductive tissues of several Anastrepha species here produced have very similar quality, measured by standard metrics that report length distribution in de novo assemblies, such as average, median and N50, and comparable to what has been described in transcriptomes from A. obliqua and A. fraterculus ( Congrains et al., 2018; Rezende et al., 2016 ) and other Tephritidae species ( Salvemini et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2016 ). However, length distribution metrics like N50 may give a wrong idea of completeness, especially for transcriptome data, so we used BUSCO to evaluate the gene content of the assemblies. This program revealed that a very low percentage of conserved Arthropoda ortholog clusters were missing (<2.5%) or fragmented (<2.3%) in the raw transcriptomes. Furthermore, BUSCO was also useful to evaluate our efficiency to obtain unigenes, which produced low percentages of duplicates conserved orthologs (<1.35%) without greatly increasing missing orthologs (>4%). Since BUSCO was designed for genomic analyses, such a low rate of missing orthologs on transcriptomes, along with the high percentages of annotated CDSs, should be an indication of the high quality and completeness of the data and assembly here produced. The transcriptome data allowed us to infer thousands of ortholog groups across several species of Anastrepha which enabled us to reconstruct their evolutionary histories using mitochondrial and nuclear genes. mtDNA phylogeny based on four genes displayed poorly resolved relationships among Anastrepha species groups, which is a similar pattern found in previously published phylogenies using mtDNA or a very limited number of nuclear markers ( Barr et al., 2005; McPheron et al., 1999; Mengual et al., 2017; Silva and Barr, 2008 ). Moreover, the mtDNA inference also failed to resolve relationships among fraterculus group lineages, showing a large clade that included almost all lineages, except four individuals from A. fraterculus C1 (putatively Anastrepha sp. 1 aff. fraterculus ) and A. distincta , similar to what has been found on previous studies ( Ludeña et al., 2010; Scally et al., 2016; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001 ). In contrast, our genome-wide approach showed strong support for the species groups and their relationships, as well as different lineages that represent putatively separate species in the fraterculus group, which, in general, agree with the phylogenetic inference of Mengual et al. (2017) . Our results do not support the placement of A. bistrigata in the serpentina group, proposed by the combination of striata and serpentina groups ( Norrbom, 2002 ). This placement has already been disputed by karyotypic data ( Selivon et al., 2007 ) and by other molecular data, which actually placed A. bistrigata as a sister group to the fraterculus group ( Mengual et al., 2017; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001 ). In contrast to Mengual et al. (2017) , our results show A. grandis and A. pseudoparallela forming a clade, which is sister to the A. bistrigata and fraterculus group clade. Even though these branches have strong support, some are very short and may be affected by ancestral gene flow ( Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the phylogeny of the fraterculus group was in general similar to the inference published by Scally et al. (2016) , both showing strong support for the fraterculus group and their lineages. However, in that study, A. distincta was sister to the other fraterculus group species, whereas we found that species to have diverged recently and being closely related to A. turpiniae . These differences may be due to the smaller number of genes used in that study ( Scally et al., 2016 ), making it more likely to be affected by the high level of phylogenetic discordance among genes and the interspecific gene flow, which was also suggested by those authors. Furthermore, the phylogenetic inference in that study was based on concatenated genes which could be more sensitive to ILS and gene flow ( Kubatko and Degnan, 2007; Solís-Lemus et al., 2016 ). Though gene flow may obscure phylogenetic inferences ( Leaché et al., 2014 ), the fact that we inferred the same topology using diverse phylogenetic methodologies (concatenation and multi-species coalescent approaches), even when we allowed for introgression, suggests that there are different degrees of introgression across the genome and those lineages have evolved with some independence in certain genomic regions. The A. fraterculus group lineage is well supported in our analysis, as well as the relationships amongst species in the group, but we found the species A. fraterculus separated in three different lineages, which could agree with the suggestion that this species complex is composed of several cryptic species, three of them previously identified in Brazil (reviewed in Vaníčková et al., 2015 ). Even though there may be some markers that could be effective at separating these species, it has been suggested that only by applying integrative taxonomy across several populations and morphological attributes might we be able to effectively distinguishing these species and correctly assign individuals to those taxa ( Dias et al., 2016; Schutze et al., 2017 ). It has been proposed that the ITS1 region might be useful to separate some lineages in the A. fraterculus complex ( Sutton et al., 2015 ) and even help to identify species in the complex ( Prezotto et al., 2019 ). In our study, we could not recover ITS1 sequences from all individuals, but the phylogenetic analysis of this region displayed two different A. fraterculus clades that matched the species tree, suggesting that this region could indeed help to sort out the diversity of the fraterculus complex. On the other hand, the three morphometrically identified species suggested to occur in Brazil ( Selivon et al., 2005; Selivon et al., 2004 ) are all represented in a single ITS1 clade, referred to as TI/TIa in Sutton et al. (2015) and TIb/TIc/TId in Prezotto et al. (2019) , and are very closely related. The three A. fraterculus lineages we detected here could correspond to these putative species, but this does not look like to be the case, since one of these lineages shows ITS sequences that are more closely related to TII than to TI (Figure S5), and though we failed to recover the ITS sequence for A. fraterculus C3, in the multigene species tree this lineage was more closely related to A. obliqua . For that reason, and because we also detected high levels of introgression and ILS that would limit the ability of a single marker to make phylogenetic inferences, even the ITS1 gene, care should be exercised to identify species of the A. fraterculus complex across its distribution. Previous studies have suggested that the genetic structure of A. fraterculus lineages, even among Brazilian lineages, would be influenced by different selective pressures affecting populations at different altitudes ( Manni et al., 2015; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001 ). However, Anastrepha sp. 1 aff. fraterculus (possibly what we refer to as A. fraterculus C1) and A. fraterculus C2 lineages are widely and sympatrically distributed across Brazil without clear association to different altitudes or hosts, for that matter. Thus, the differentiation of these lineages may be caused by other factors than divergence in those ecological attributes, and may also be influenced by differential gene flow across their distribution. However, we still lack important information about host specificity or species distribution that could help us understand their differentiation ( Prezotto et al., 2019 ). Mito-nuclear discordance, ABBA-BABA tests and phylogenetic networks suggest a history of introgression in the evolution and divergence of the fraterculus group that extends to the Anastrepha genus. Gene flow among fraterculus group lineages has previously been reported ( Díaz et al., 2018; Scally et al., 2016 ), but this is the first study detecting introgression using genome scale datasets with samples from the species groups. Our results showed robust signals for introgression, producing D statistics values greater than 0.1 in ten combinations tested. These values are relatively high when compared to other insect genera with interspecific gene flow such as Heliconius ( Zhang et al., 2016 ) or Papilio ( Zhang et al., 2013 ) butterflies, but similar to what was reported for sibling mosquito species ( Fontaine et al., 2015 ), which may indicate that the signals are not only a reminiscent of older hybridization events. The evidence of introgression among species of the fraterculus group is supported by laboratory mating experiments that have shown possible hybrids among some A. fraterculus complex lineages ( Cáceres et al., 2009; Devescovi et al., 2014; Dias et al., 2016; Roriz et al., 2017; Rull et al., 2013; Vera et al., 2006 ), and even among more divergent species such as some lineages of A. fraterculus with A. obliqua and A. sororcula ( Rull et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2001 ). Even though these are forced crosses limited by space (cages) that show various levels of assortative mating (reviewed in Juárez et al., 2015 ) and reproductive isolation, it is possible that hybridization even between species still occurs in nature. In this study, we tried to tackle the diversification of the A. fraterculus complex by sampling from several localities across its distribution. Even though this sampling was still very limited, particularly because we only use a single specimen from each locality, we identified three lineages that could represent species within the complex that are reported in Brazil, though ITS1 sequences do not provide much support for that. Furthermore, we detected high levels of introgression between species in the fraterculus group, which involved A. fraterculus lineages, so much that species networks reveal that at least 30% of their genomes have been inherited from an alternative parent species ( Fig. 5 A and B). In this sense, we cannot rule out the possibility that A. fraterculus is in fact a species complex that still evolves as a paraphyletic unit, sharing several traits in common between diversifying lineages, that would show different levels of introgression across their genomes. Should that be the case, we would expect that the introgression level, and the parts of the genome involved, would vary across the species distribution, leading to a potential lack of congruence among different markers used on different populations, as shown in previous studies ( Barr et al., 2005; Prezotto et al., 2019; Smith-Caldas et al., 2001; Sutton et al., 2015 ). The indication of introgression, for instance from ABBA-BABA tests, among more distantly related species, such as species from distinct species groups, may be reminiscent of ancient introgression. D statistics among species from different Anastrepha groups were significant, but their values were much smaller than those reported among lineages in the fraterculus group, suggesting weaker signals of introgression. Since D statistics fails to discriminate between recent and ancestral pattern of introgression ( Durand et al., 2011; Ottenburghs et al., 2017 ) and the Anastrepha network showed a reticulation with high inheritance probablity (γ = 0.26) between ancestral branches of the species group ( Fig. 5 A), it is likely that some of those signals are remnants of ancestral events. These introgressed genes may be preferentially retained in genome regions with low recombination rates that are in linkage disequilibrium to genes involved in reproductive isolation or evolving under adaptive selection ( Schumer et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013 ). Besides, D statistics may result in false positive by recurrent mutations, especially in comparisons among more distantly related species, since bias in mutation rate are more likey to occur ( Durand et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, species from different Anastrepha groups are morphologically and ecologically distinct ( Norrbom et al., 1999 ), and there is no evidence of possible hybrids between them, which makes the hypothesis for ongoing gene flow between groups unlikely. One of the main challenges of studying lineages that diverged recently is that they may have experienced recent gene flow while still segregating ancestral polymorphism, which complicates phylogenetic inferences, as well as inferences of evolutionary forces shaping their diversity. To this matter, we separated genes into different classes, depending on how much congruence there was on eight pivotal nodes between their gene trees and the inferred species tree. We did so not only because all phylogenetic methods produced the same species tree, but also because its topology, in general, indicates species groups relationships that are compatible with what has been described, but also because it recovers all recognized species in the clade with robust support, as well as potential lineages in the A. fraterculus complex. Such strategy then allowed us to separate gene trees that were completely, or mostly, congruent with this putative species tree from others that failed, in different levels, to fully recover the species tree. Besides, the tree space analysis revealed that these genes evolved under particular degree of introgression and selection, suggesting that they do not recover the species tree topology by chance, but because they possibly evolved under similar underlying processes. Though, these features make them suitable candidates for being used as genetic markers to identify species across Anastrepha , further research including more lineages and individuals per lineages are needed to support this hypothesis. Our results show that average bootstrap values increase with phylogenetic resolution, an opposite trend from what we observed for overall tree length. This interesting result indicates that there is more support for nodes that were retained in the global species tree, which would be expected considering that there should be a higher congruence between gene trees and species trees when there is less ancestral polymorphism. Different evolutionary forces may influence gene tree discordance, such as drift or even a consequence of selection affecting these regions ( Degnan and Rosenberg, 2009 ). It is then interesting that even though the general pattern suggests a strong influence of purifying and background selection across all classes, reflected in the low overall d N /d S rates, there is an increase in the d N /d S ratio with the increase in phylogenetic resolution, albeit by a small amount. This could be explained, in part, by positive Darwinian selection ( Buschiazzo et al., 2012 ), relaxed selection ( Wertheim et al., 2015 ) or even purifying selection in conserved genes ( Wolf et al., 2009 ). Though we do not have evidence to completely discard any of them, we would expect that purifying selection would decrease d S along with d N with time. In a similar manner, drift should impact both estimates equally, but not necessarily by decreasing them. Since we detected a reduction in synonymous changes, but not on non-synonymous changes, coupled with shorter branch lengths, it seems that genes that are phylogenetically more informative would have a combination of purifying selection filtering genetic variation and positive selection favoring some non-synonymous changes, coupled with selective sweep that would reduce hitchhiking variation synonymous and non-synonymous. This pattern would also have an impact in the introgression of new genetic variation on these genes. By the way we defined phylogenic signal, one might consider a truism that regions whose gene trees would be more compatible with the overall species tree would show less introgression, since introgression tends to break phylogenetic resolution and it is inferred exactly from such deviations. Should that be the case, we would expect then that there would be a negative correlation between phylogenetic signal and introgression. We observe though that genes with low phylogenetic signal (classes from 0 to 25% of resolved nodes) displayed lower signals for introgression than genes with intermediate phylogenetic signal, suggesting a strong effect of ILS in those regions, reflected on the higher variance for these estimates ( Fig. 7 ). It is possible that in these cases, the amount of ILS is so high that it decreases the ability to detect introgression ( Eckert and Carstens, 2008 ). It is because of the confoundment between estimates of ancestral polymorphism and gene flow in these categories that we believe that groups of genes with more phylogenetic resolution (35.7 – 50% of resolved nodes) show higher levels of introgression, not necessarily because they introgress more readily. Even though then, in general, resistance to interspecific gene flow increases in genes whose evolutionary histories match the species tree, we see a small spike of introgression in the last category (100% of resolved nodes). That could be a reflex of positive selection and hybrid advantage in a few ecologically important genes, such as those reported for Heliconius ( The Heliconius Genome Consortium, 2012 ), though we cannot rule out that it could have been stochasticity, considering the smaller number of genes involved in that category. The phylogenetic history of Anastrepha species shows signals of recent rapid diversification, inferred by short internal branches and low resolution across several clades ( Mengual et al., 2017 ), some that may have diverged with gene flow. Rapid diversification may be strongly favored by introgression, especially because adaptive variation would be moved faster among diverging lineages than new advantageous mutations arise ( Mallet, 2007 ). Some of the most iconic and well-studied examples of rapid adaptive radiations involved the effect of introgression, such as mimicry pattern of Heliconius butterflies ( The Heliconius Genome Consortium, 2012 ), beak shape diversification of Darwin’s finches ( Lamichhaney et al., 2015 ) and vision patterns of cichlid fishes ( Meier et al., 2017 ). Races of another tephritid, the apple maggot Rhagoletis pomonella diverged rapidly with gene flow mainly due to host shifts preferences ( Feder et al., 2003 ). Though few Anastrepha species are strongly associated with their host plants ( Aluja, 1994 ), such as A. grandis , A. distincta or A. amita , some of the most important pest species, such as some from the fraterculus species group, are generalists. It is possible that generalist species, such as A fraterculus ( Zucchi and Moraes, 2008 ), might benefit from introgression of specialized genotypes to different hosts or habitats, which would be more geographically restricted, leading to genomic heterogeneity across the species distribution. In this scenario, generalist species might be even more influenced by introgression, especially if they are not reproductively isolated from the other species, and there is a potential for hybrid vigor that overrides hybrid breakdown ( Dagilis et al., 2019 ). Cross experiments between morphotypes of the A. fraterculus complex showed that hybrid females prefer to mate with hybrid males ( Segura et al., 2011 ), suggesting that hybridization and selection have played a key role in the diversification of these taxa. 5 Conclusions Here we produced transcriptomes from reproductive tissues for 10 evolutionary lineages of Anastrepha , the majority of which are considered as major agricultural pests from South America and generated the first phylogeny based on genomic data for these important pests. Our approach enabled us to produce a high-quality cluster of orthologs which was used to accurately reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among these Anastrepha lineages applying concatenation and multispecies coalescent methods. Though we have a limited number of species here investigated, the high support, measured by gene concordance factors, bootstraps and quartet supports, point to a very robust phylogeny not only for deeper nodes of the Anastrepha genus, but for several lineages and putative species as well. The short internal nodes generally found even separating diverse species groups corroborates that this genus has diverged rapidly, as several other insect clades ( Magnacca and Price, 2015; Moest et al., 2020; Moore and Robertson, 2014 ), though with extensive signals for introgression especially among fraterculus lineages. Despite the high levels of ancestral polymorphism and introgression detected in most of the genome of species in the fraterculus group, our approach enabled us to reconstruct a robust phylogeny for the group, as well as identify a set of genes with high level of phylogenetic resolution, which may potentially be more effective in the grey zone between lineage separation and species divergence ( De Queiroz, 2007 ). Hence, these genes may have fixed or nearly fixed species specific variants, which would be useful for identifying economically important pest lineages, considering an integrated approach ( Schutze et al., 2017 ). Similar approaches may be applied to resolving phylogenetic relationship and underlying evolutionary forces affecting other recently diverged and potentially introgressed lineages.
