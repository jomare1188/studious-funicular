    "full_text": "The T cell receptor is a fundamental mediator of the adaptive immune responses, since TR αβ on T cells recognize foreign structures (peptides derived from processed antigens) bound to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on APC cells. In the present study, we report the cloning of six TRB chains cDNA sequences from gilthead sea bream ( Sparus aurata ), a fish of high economical impact in South Mediterranean aquaculture. The V-BETA domains have the canonical features of known teleost and mammalian TR V-BETA domains and have been divided in four different subgroups. A multiple alignment of the six sea bream TRB chains with other known TRB sequences was assembled and showed the conservation of the four cysteine residues involved in disulphide bonds and of some amino acids with an important role in the assembly and signalling of the TR αβ/CD3 complex. Real-time PCR analysis was used to investigate TRB basal expression, that was maximum in the thymus followed by gut, and TRB in vitro expression after stimulation with LPS or PHA-L at 4 and 24 h (only the 4 h stimulation with LPS gave a significant effect). Moreover, the 3D structures of sea bream TRB chains and MHC-I were predicted by homology modelling with the final aim to investigate the interaction surface in the V-BETA/MHC-I complexes."

          "Cell-mediated immunity is one of the main lines of defence that vertebrates rely on for eliminating pathogen agents. The T cell receptor (TR), the antigen receptor expressed by the T lymphocytes, is present in all jawed vertebrates, while it appears to be absent in jawless fish ( Klausner et al., 1990 ). The TR is an heterodimer, consisting of either α/β or γ/δ chains which are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Each chain contains a variable (V) and a constant (C) domain ( Lefranc and Lefranc, 2001 ). T cells are activated when a TR heterodimer (αβ or γδ) in conjunction with the CD3 complex specifically recognizes an external antigen (Ag). TR αβ recognizes a processed Ag as a peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC), while TR γδ is not MHC-restricted and appears to recognize Ag in a similar manner to the direct processes of Ig ( Chien et al., 1996 ).",
          "The TR specificity is determined by the three hyper-variable regions of the V domains: the complementarity determining regions (CDR) ( Rast and Litman, 1994 ). The diversity of TR αβ is generated by the assembly of V, D and, for β chain, J genes ( Lefranc and Lefranc, 2001 ). Recombination signal sequences and recombination activator genes (RAG) are required for rearrangement of the TR genes ( Marchalonis et al., 2002 ). The analysis of the TR chain sequences led to the correct prediction that they would share a domain organization and binding mode similar to those of antibody Fab fragments ( Warr et al., 1979; Davis and Bjorkmann, 1988; Claverie et al., 1989 ). The first crystal structure of TR αβ bound to a peptide/MHC complex (TR/pMHC) was obtained in 1996 ( Garboczi et al., 1996 ) and 24 TR/pMHC (both TR/pMHC-I and TR/pMHC-II) are available at the moment ( Rudolph et al., 2006 ) and are annotated in the IMGT/3Dstructure-DB database ( Kaas et al., 2004 ).",
          "TRA and TRB genes have been characterised in both teleost and cartilaginous fishes ( Partula et al., 1995; Hordvik et al., 1996; De Guerra and Charlemagne, 1997; Wilson et al., 1998; Miracle et al., 2001; Wermenstam and Pilstrom, 2001; Hordvik et al., 2004; Imai et al., 2005 ) with the Japanese flounder ( Paralichthys olivaceus ) being the first species in which genes of the four TR loci have been identified ( Nam et al., 2003 ). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that TR genes in teleost fish are organized in translocon type clusters ( De Guerra and Charlemagne, 1997; Zhou et al., 2003 ) and, as in mammals, the TRA and TRD genes appear to be at the same locus on the genome ( Wang et al., 2001; Fischer et al., 2002; Nam et al., 2003 ). In contrast to mammals, there is a high degree of polymorphism of the TRBC genes in the bicolor damselfish ( Kamper and Churchill McKinney, 2002 ). Finally, the expression of TRB chain has been monitored during amoebic gill disease in rainbow trout to verify its possible up/down regulation ( Bridle et al., 2006 ) and the spectra typing of TRB transcripts has revealed that the naive T cell repertoire is dramatically skewed during viral infection ( Boudinot et al., 2001, 2002 ).",
          "In the present study, we report the cDNA sequences of six TRB chains from sea bream ( Sparus aurata ), a fish of high economical impact in South Mediterranean aquaculture, and their expression pattern both at basal level and after in vitro stimulations. These results will add a new tool for studying the effects of vaccinations and immuno-stimulations on the sea bream immune system. Moreover, we analysed the cDNAs organisation and predicted, by homology modelling, the 3D structures of the TRB chains alone or complexed with the sea bream MHC-I."

              "Two degenerate primers (TCNEFR: 5′-SACRTGGTCRGGRTARAA-3′ and TCNERV: 5′-GCNGTKTAYTWCTGTGC-3′ where N = A, C, G, T; W = A, T; R = A, G; K = G, T; S = G, C; Y = C, T) corresponding to highly conserved regions of known TRB genes were used in RT-PCR on total RNA extracted with Tripure (Roche) solution from a juvenile sea bream (150 g of weight) thymus. The leukocyte cells were obtained following the procedures described in Scapigliati et al. (2001) . RT-PCR was performed using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR Beads (Amersham Pharmacia). Reactions were conducted using the Mastercycler personal (Eppendorf). The cycling protocol was one cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 48 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products (15 μl) were visualised on 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (10 ng/ml) using hyperladder IV (Bioline) as size marker. Controls for the presence of DNA contamination were performed using the RNA samples as template. DNA amplified by PCR was purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAgen), inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Plasmid DNA from at least ten independent clones was purified using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega) and sequenced using MWG DNA Sequencing Services. Sequences generated were analysed for similarity with other known sequences using the FASTA ( Pearson and Lipman, 1988 ) and BLAST ( Altschul et al., 1990 ) programs.",
              "Further primers were designed based on the initial sea bream TRB sequence for 5′- and 3′- rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR (TCRFR1: 5′-CCACCAACAGTGAAAGTGC-3′ and TCRAFR2: 5′-CGTTGCTTTGTGTGATCAGC-3′; TCRRV1: 5′-GCTGATCACACAAAGCAACG-3′ and TCRRV2: 5′-GCACTTTCACTGTTGGTGG-3′). cDNA was synthesised from total thymus RNA with the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia) following the manufacturers instructions. For 3′ RACE-PCR, cDNA was transcribed using an oligo-dT adaptor primer (5′-CTCGAGATCGATGCGGCCGCT 15 -3′). PCR was performed initially with the TCRFR1 primer and the oligo-dT adaptor primer, followed by a semi-nested PCR using TCRFR2 primer and the adaptor primer (5′-CTCGAGATCGATGCGGCCGC-3′). For 5′ RACE-PCR, cDNA was transcribed from total RNA using the oligo-dT primer, treated with E. coli RNase H (Promega), purified using a PCR Purification Kit (QIAgen), and tailed with poly(C) at the 5′ end with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT, Promega). PCR was performed initially with TCRRV1 primer and an oligo-dG primer (5′-GGGGGGIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′), and then semi-nested with TCRRV2 and the oligo-dG primers. Sequencing and similarity searches were as described above.",
              "The obtained sequences were analysed for the presence of a signal peptide, using SignalP software ( Nielsen et al., 1997 ), and of N- (with the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server) and O-linked glycosylation sites ( Julenius et al., 2005 ). The V and C domains of the TRB chains were also analysed following the IMGT ® (the international ImMunoGeneTics information system ® ) standardisation numbering ( Lefranc and Lefranc, 2001 ; Lefranc et al., 2003, 2005b ). Comparison of the sea bream TRB amino acid sequences to their counterparts from other species was carried out using the MEGA 3.1 Software ( Kumar et al., 2004 ). Phylogenetic trees was constructed by the “neighbour-joining” method using MEGA 3.1 Software ( Kumar et al., 2004 ) and bootstrap values were calculated."

(2001) . Total RNA was isolated from each tissue separately with Tripure (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions, resuspended in DEPC treated water and used for real-time quantitative PCR without pooling the samples coming from the different fishes. Controls for the presence of DNA contamination were performed using β-actin primers that bracket an intron.",
              "For reverse transcription, the BioScript RNase H minus (Bioline) enzyme was used with the protocol described in Buonocore et al. (2007) . The expression level of TRB transcript was determined with a Mx3000P™ real time PCR system (Stratagene) equipped with version 2.02 software and using the Brilliant SYBR Green Q-PCR Master Mix (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions, with ROX as internal passive reference dye. Specific PCR primers were designed for the amplification of about 200 bp products from TRB (selected in the TRBC region) and β-actin, used as an house-keeping gene. The primers were: RQTCRFR: 5′-GTCGACGCCAACAAATGG-3′ and RQTCRRV: 5′-AGACGCAGCCCTTGATGA-3′, RQACTFR: 5′-ATGTACGTTGCCATCC-3′ and RQACTRV: 5′-GAGATGCCACGCTCTC-3′, respectively. Approximately 20 ng of cDNA template was used in each PCR reaction. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 45 s. Triplicate reactions were performed for each template cDNA and the template was replaced with water in all blank control reactions. The analysis was carried out using the endpoints method option that causes the collection of the fluorescence data at the end of each extension stage of amplification. A relative quantitation has been performed, comparing the levels of the target transcript (TRB) to a reference transcript (calibrator, the tissue with the lowest TRB expression, in this case the head kidney). A normalizer target (β-actin) is included to correct for differences in total cDNA input between samples. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the results obtained from the ten considered fishes. The real-time PCR products from the different tissues were examined successively by agarose gel electrophoresis to investigate their specificity and size."

As the sequence identities between the sea bream TRB chains and the human and murine homologous templates were close to 30%, i.e. from 28 to 34%, we used an accurate procedure already described ( Facchiano et al., 2001; Scapigliati et al., 2004; Buonocore et al., 2006, 2007 ).",

To select the best model, we used the PROCHECK program ( Laskowski et al., 1993 ) to evaluate their stereochemical and structural packing quality. The ProsaII program ( Sippl, 1993 ) was used to check the fitness of the sequences to the obtained structures and to assign a scoring function. Secondary structures were assigned by the DSSP program ( Kabsch and Sander, 1983 ). Search for structural classification was performed on CATH database ( Orengo et al., 1997; Pearl et al., 2000 ).",

The sequence identity percentages between sea bream and man/mouse resulted of 31 and 34%, respectively.

CVFF force field developed for the Insight II software was adopted to assign potentials and charges for the complexed proteins. The complexes were minimized by using 500 steps of energy minimization under conjugate gradient algorithm in order to optimise side chain conformations and avoid sterical clashes according to the procedures used in previous similar works ( Scapigliati et al., 2004; Costantini et al., 2005; Chambery et al., 2007; Costantini et al., 2007 ). To compare the protein-protein interaction in the complexes, the “Protein–Protein Interaction Server” ( Jones and Thornton, 1996 ) and the program NACCESS ( Hubbard et al., 1991 ) were used to evaluate the interface surface area and to identify the amino acids at the protein–receptor interface. H-bonds were calculated with Hbplus program ( McDonald and Thornton, 1994 ), that identifies H-bonds within a distance of 2.5 Å and a minimum angle of 90°. Moreover, the energy of interaction between MHC-I and V-BETA domains was also calculated by using the Energy/Intermolecular tool in the Docking module of Insight II and the binding free energy by using the DCOMPLEX program ( Liu et al., 2004 )."

              "The six TRBV genes ( Fig. 1 , Panel A) belong to four different subgroups ( Fig. 1 , Panel B) using a 75% overall nucleotide identity to order the sequences in a pairwise similarity analysis of the V-REGION (comprised between the first codon and second cysteine residue in position 104, according to the IMGT unique numbering) ( Lefranc et al., 2003 ). An alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of the six S. aurata TRBV genes with other known TRBV sequences was assembled ( Fig. 2 ) to investigate the conservation of characteristic amino acid residues involved in structural domains. An analysis of the S. aurata sequences ( Fig. 2 ) showed the presence of different putative N -glycosylation sites in the six clones and no O -glycosylation sites. In the V-REGION, no N -glycosylation sites are present in clone 3, one is present in clone 1 (position 87–89 according to the IMGT numbering), clone 2 (position 14–16), clone 5 (position 22–24) and clone 6 (position 87–89), and two in clone 4 (position 16–18 and 24–26). Three sites are present in the C-DOMAIN of the six clones in positions 38–40, 110–112 and 120–122 according to the IMGT numbering. A similar situation for the putative glycosylation sites has been found in the channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) ( Wilson et al., 1998 ), in the Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) ( Hordvik et al., 1996 ) and in the Japanese flounder ( P. olivaceus ) ( Nam et al., 2003 ). Some amino acid residues are conserved in all the considered sequences ( Fig. 2 ) from fish to mammals and this should indicate their importance for the TRB chain functional activity. Two cysteines (C23 and C104) involved in an intrachain disulfide bond fundamental for the assembly of the V-BETA domain ( Wilson and Garcia, 1997 ) are conserved in sea bream, together with the motif Phe118-Gly119-X120-Gly121 (according to the IMGT unique numbering for V-DOMAIN) ( Lefranc et al., 2003 ) in the FR4-IMGT, typical of most TRB chains and Ig light chains ( Wilson et al., 1998; Lefranc et al., 2005b ). The C-BETA domain is the region that presents the highest homology between all considered sequences. The two cysteines (C147 and C212) that forms another intrachain disulfide bond ( Wilson and Garcia, 1997 ), the arginine of the motif Ser87-Arg88-Leu89, linked to the TR αβ interaction ( Arnaud et al., 1997 ), and the Glu13, which is thought to form an hydrophilic bond with the TRA chain ( Garcia et al., 1996 ), are also conserved in sea bream. On the contrary, the Cys residue in the connecting-region (CO) that in mammals ( Wilson and Garcia, 1997 ) is known to form an interchain disulfide bond with TRA chain is not present, as already observed in all known teleost sequences ( Hordvik et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1998; Wermenstam and Pilstrom, 2001; Nam et al., 2003 ). The CO region shows no conserved amino acids, while in the TM region the residue Lys (K) at position 5, that should be important for the TR αβ cell surface expression and for the assembly of the complex between TRB chain and CD3 ( Morley et al., 1988; Alcover et al., 1990 ), is present in sea bream.",

              "The 3D MHC-I model ( Fig. 7 ) has a classical organization in three distinct domains (G-ALPHA1 [D1], G-ALPHA2 [D2] and C-LIKE [D3]) in agreement with the structural classification reported by CATH database ( Orengo et al., 1997; Pearl et al., 2000 ) for the crystallographic structures of human and murine MHC-I. The G-ALPHA1 [D1] and G-ALPHA2 [D2] domains are classified as “alpha-beta” and each consists of an alpha helical region and four strands of beta sheet in an anti-parallel orientation. The C-terminal domain (C-LIKE [D3]) has a “mainly beta” fold and is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich made of two anti-parallel sheets, each consisting of three main strands and few shorter strands, organized in Greek-keys motifs. In the sea bream MHC-I model four cysteine residues are located in the same positions of the human and murine templates and they should form two intrachain disulfide bonds, one in the G-ALPHA2 [D2] domain (Cys at positions 11 and 74 in the IMGT Collier de Perles, according to the IMGT unique numbering for G-DOMAIN) ( Lefranc et al., 2005a ) and the other in the C-LIKE [D3] domain (position 23 and 104 according to the IMGT unique numbering for C-DOMAIN and C-LIKE-DOMAIN) ( Lefranc et al., 2005b ). The sea bream MHC-I model was compared by structural superimposition with the two experimental structures used as templates, but the presence of gaps in the alignment made it difficult to perform a complete structural comparison of the three models (RMSD values of 1.12 and 0.96, respectively). However, the comparison of the secondary structures evidenced that the helices and beta-strands are conserved, with few external residues resulting added or excluded in some secondary structure elements and that the 3 10 helix present in human and murine structures is not conserved in the sea bream MHC-I model."

              "On the basis of the crystallographic structure of the murine V-BETA/MHC-1 complex we simulated the interaction between each of the six V-BETA domains and MHC-I in sea bream. For each complex we evaluated the interaction residues, the number of interchain H-bonds and the interface surface area ( Table 1 ). The interaction regions between the V-BETA and MHC-I in each complex are well conserved (data not shown) and, in particular, the amino acids of TRB chains at the interface with MHC-I are located in loop regions, whether the MHC-I ones are in helical regions. However, the number of interaction residues is different in the several complexes, due to the amino acid differences between the six sea bream V-BETA amino acid sequences. The value of interface surface area and the number of interchain H-bonds resulted the highest for the complex between V-BETA clone 3 and MHC-I (see Table 1 ); the other complexes show little differences in the interface surface area values and variable numbers of interchain H-bonds."

          "The heterodimeric, membrane anchored TR αβ endows the cell with antigen specific reactivity and this molecule has been extensively studied in mammals. Fish, like all jawed vertebrates, can develop cell mediated immunity and the knowledge on fish TRB genes has increased rapidly in recent years. In this paper we report the homology cloning of the TRB chain from sea bream ( S. aurata ), and analysed its expression and 3D structure model, with a particular interest to the interactions with MHC-I.",
          "Six different TRB cDNAs were isolated from the thymus of a juvenile sea bream and the predicted amino acid sequences were studied to evidence the presence of conserved structures. The J region motif ( Moss and Bell, 1995 ), F-G-X-G, and the Cys involved in mammals in two intrachain disulfide bonds in the V domain and in the C domain are conserved in all sea bream sequences (see Fig. 1 ). The Cys that in mammals is involved in an interchain disulfide bond with TRA is not present in sea bream, but some authors ( Arnaud et al., 1997 ) demonstrated that it may be not important for the dimerisation of the TR αβ heterodimer. On the contrary, the amino acid motif (85.2YCLSSRLRVSA93) that the same authors proposed to be involved in the TR αβ chain interaction and cell surface expression, is partially conserved in all sequences. Therefore, the amino acids (the Y85.2 and the stretch 87SRL89) that in this motif are retained from fish to mammals should be fundamental for the structure/function relationship in TRB chains. The conserved antigen receptor transmembrane (CART) motif ( Campbell et al., 1994 ), made mainly of polar or aromatic amino acids, is present in sea bream TM sequences like in all teleost TRB chains. It should encode a structural unit with an important role in the assembly and/or signalling of the TR αβ/CD3 complex ( Campbell et al., 1994 ). In particular, the two tyrosine residues (Y-265 and Y-275), that have been identified to have a fundamental role in the signalling of TR αβ towards the ξ subunit of CD3 ( Fuller-Espie et al., 1998 ) in mammals, are conserved in sea bream.",
          "Real-time PCR analysis detected high levels of constitutive TRB expression in thymus (see Fig. 4 ), as already observed in cod ( Wermenstam and Pilstrom, 2001 ) and rainbow trout ( Partula et al., 1995 ), followed by gut, in contrast to what was detected in cod ( Wermenstam and Pilstrom, 2001 ), where no expression was found in the intestine. However, the gut is a tissue with a certain number of T cells ( Romano et al., 2007 ) and deeply involved in fish immune responses and leukocytes ontogeny as demonstrated in rainbow trout ( Bernard et al., 2006 ), sea bass and carp ( Rombout et al., 2005 ). In vitro TRB expression was studied using sea bream head kidney leukocyte cells with the stimulant LPS, to simulate a pathogen infection, or the cell mitogen agent PHA-L. LPS induced an high TRB expression in sea bream after 4 h as observed also in vivo on mice ( Tough et al., 1997 ), whether PHA-L showed no effect both after 4 h and 24 h. Probably, this last result was due to the stimulation period that was too short, as in the Pagrus auratus ( Morrison et al., 2004 ) leukocyte proliferation was induced significantly by PHA-L only after 72 h.",
          "3D structural modelling of sea bream V-BETA domains showed that the beta-strands and the CDR1, CDR2 loops are well conserved in all clones but the conformation of CDR3 is different in clone 3 with respect to the other clones. The simulation of the complexes between the V-BETA domains and the sea bream MHC-I gave us the opportunity to study the amino acid residues at the interaction surface. Furthermore, for each complex we have evaluated the binding energy and interaction energy ( Fig. 8 ) and the best values have been obtained for the complex with TRB clone 3: this complex showed also the highest value of interface surface area and the highest number of interchain H-bonds (see Table 1 ). This result could be due to the different orientation of CDR3 loop that is known to show large conformational changes upon binding and modulate the interaction with the peptide and MHC-I providing a mechanism of structural plasticity to accommodate a variety of different peptide antigens ( Garcia et al., 1998 ).",
          "In conclusion, the availability of sea bream TRB chain sequences will add a new tool to analyse fish immune responses to viral and parasitic infections and will be of relevance to study the phylogeny and evolution of specific antigen receptors. Moreover, the investigation on the V-BETA/MHC-1 complexes will help to obtain information about the putative amino acid residues at the interaction surfaces. The step forward will be the search of an experimental testing to assess the 3D structures reliability: probably it could be possible to make some synthetic peptides that should block the interactions between TR αβ and MHC-I, based on the conserved amino acid residues at the interaction surfaces, and investigate if these peptides are able to modulate sea bream immune responses."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Cell-mediated immunity is one of the main lines of defence that vertebrates rely on for eliminating pathogen agents. The T cell receptor (TR), the antigen receptor expressed by the T lymphocytes, is present in all jawed vertebrates, while it appears to be absent in jawless fish ( Klausner et al., 1990 ). The TR is an heterodimer, consisting of either α/β or γ/δ chains which are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Each chain contains a variable (V) and a constant (C) domain ( Lefranc and Lefranc, 2001 ). T cells are activated when a TR heterodimer (αβ or γδ) in conjunction with the CD3 complex specifically recognizes an external antigen (Ag). TR αβ recognizes a processed Ag as a peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC), while TR γδ is not MHC-restricted and appears to recognize Ag in a similar manner to the direct processes of Ig ( Chien et al., 1996 ). The TR specificity is determined by the three hyper-variable regions of the V domains: the complementarity determining regions (CDR) ( Rast and Litman, 1994 ). The diversity of TR αβ is generated by the assembly of V, D and, for β chain, J genes ( Lefranc and Lefranc, 2001 ). Recombination signal sequences and recombination activator genes (RAG) are required for rearrangement of the TR genes ( Marchalonis et al., 2002 ). The analysis of the TR chain sequences led to the correct prediction that they would share a domain organization and binding mode similar to those of antibody Fab fragments ( Warr et al., 1979; Davis and Bjorkmann, 1988; Claverie et al., 1989 ). The first crystal structure of TR αβ bound to a peptide/MHC complex (TR/pMHC) was obtained in 1996 ( Garboczi et al., 1996 ) and 24 TR/pMHC (both TR/pMHC-I and TR/pMHC-II) are available at the moment ( Rudolph et al., 2006 ) and are annotated in the IMGT/3Dstructure-DB database ( Kaas et al., 2004 ). TRA and TRB genes have been characterised in both teleost and cartilaginous fishes ( Partula et al., 1995; Hordvik et al., 1996; De Guerra and Charlemagne, 1997; Wilson et al., 1998; Miracle et al., 2001; Wermenstam and Pilstrom, 2001; Hordvik et al., 2004; Imai et al., 2005 ) with the Japanese flounder ( Paralichthys olivaceus ) being the first species in which genes of the four TR loci have been identified ( Nam et al., 2003 ). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that TR genes in teleost fish are organized in translocon type clusters ( De Guerra and Charlemagne, 1997; Zhou et al., 2003 ) and, as in mammals, the TRA and TRD genes appear to be at the same locus on the genome ( Wang et al., 2001; Fischer et al., 2002; Nam et al., 2003 ). In contrast to mammals, there is a high degree of polymorphism of the TRBC genes in the bicolor damselfish ( Kamper and Churchill McKinney, 2002 ). Finally, the expression of TRB chain has been monitored during amoebic gill disease in rainbow trout to verify its possible up/down regulation ( Bridle et al., 2006 ) and the spectra typing of TRB transcripts has revealed that the naive T cell repertoire is dramatically skewed during viral infection ( Boudinot et al., 2001, 2002 ). In the present study, we report the cDNA sequences of six TRB chains from sea bream ( Sparus aurata ), a fish of high economical impact in South Mediterranean aquaculture, and their expression pattern both at basal level and after in vitro stimulations. These results will add a new tool for studying the effects of vaccinations and immuno-stimulations on the sea bream immune system. Moreover, we analysed the cDNAs organisation and predicted, by homology modelling, the 3D structures of the TRB chains alone or complexed with the sea bream MHC-I. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sea bream TRB cloning and sequencing Two degenerate primers (TCNEFR: 5′-SACRTGGTCRGGRTARAA-3′ and TCNERV: 5′-GCNGTKTAYTWCTGTGC-3′ where N = A, C, G, T; W = A, T; R = A, G; K = G, T; S = G, C; Y = C, T) corresponding to highly conserved regions of known TRB genes were used in RT-PCR on total RNA extracted with Tripure (Roche) solution from a juvenile sea bream (150 g of weight) thymus. The leukocyte cells were obtained following the procedures described in Scapigliati et al. (2001) . RT-PCR was performed using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR Beads (Amersham Pharmacia). Reactions were conducted using the Mastercycler personal (Eppendorf). The cycling protocol was one cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 48 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products (15 μl) were visualised on 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (10 ng/ml) using hyperladder IV (Bioline) as size marker. Controls for the presence of DNA contamination were performed using the RNA samples as template. DNA amplified by PCR was purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAgen), inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Plasmid DNA from at least ten independent clones was purified using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega) and sequenced using MWG DNA Sequencing Services. Sequences generated were analysed for similarity with other known sequences using the FASTA ( Pearson and Lipman, 1988 ) and BLAST ( Altschul et al., 1990 ) programs. Further primers were designed based on the initial sea bream TRB sequence for 5′- and 3′- rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR (TCRFR1: 5′-CCACCAACAGTGAAAGTGC-3′ and TCRAFR2: 5′-CGTTGCTTTGTGTGATCAGC-3′; TCRRV1: 5′-GCTGATCACACAAAGCAACG-3′ and TCRRV2: 5′-GCACTTTCACTGTTGGTGG-3′). cDNA was synthesised from total thymus RNA with the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia) following the manufacturers instructions. For 3′ RACE-PCR, cDNA was transcribed using an oligo-dT adaptor primer (5′-CTCGAGATCGATGCGGCCGCT 15 -3′). PCR was performed initially with the TCRFR1 primer and the oligo-dT adaptor primer, followed by a semi-nested PCR using TCRFR2 primer and the adaptor primer (5′-CTCGAGATCGATGCGGCCGC-3′). For 5′ RACE-PCR, cDNA was transcribed from total RNA using the oligo-dT primer, treated with E. coli RNase H (Promega), purified using a PCR Purification Kit (QIAgen), and tailed with poly(C) at the 5′ end with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT, Promega). PCR was performed initially with TCRRV1 primer and an oligo-dG primer (5′-GGGGGGIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′), and then semi-nested with TCRRV2 and the oligo-dG primers. Sequencing and similarity searches were as described above. The obtained sequences were analysed for the presence of a signal peptide, using SignalP software ( Nielsen et al., 1997 ), and of N- (with the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server) and O-linked glycosylation sites ( Julenius et al., 2005 ). The V and C domains of the TRB chains were also analysed following the IMGT ® (the international ImMunoGeneTics information system ® ) standardisation numbering ( Lefranc and Lefranc, 2001 ; Lefranc et al., 2003, 2005b ). Comparison of the sea bream TRB amino acid sequences to their counterparts from other species was carried out using the MEGA 3.1 Software ( Kumar et al., 2004 ). Phylogenetic trees was constructed by the “neighbour-joining” method using MEGA 3.1 Software ( Kumar et al., 2004 ) and bootstrap values were calculated. 2.2 Basal TRB expression analysis To study the TRB basal expression, ten sea bream juveniles were sampled and leucocytes from different tissues (thymus, spleen, liver, gills, head kidney, gut) obtained as described in Scapigliati et al. (2001) . Total RNA was isolated from each tissue separately with Tripure (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions, resuspended in DEPC treated water and used for real-time quantitative PCR without pooling the samples coming from the different fishes. Controls for the presence of DNA contamination were performed using β-actin primers that bracket an intron. For reverse transcription, the BioScript RNase H minus (Bioline) enzyme was used with the protocol described in Buonocore et al. (2007) . The expression level of TRB transcript was determined with a Mx3000P™ real time PCR system (Stratagene) equipped with version 2.02 software and using the Brilliant SYBR Green Q-PCR Master Mix (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions, with ROX as internal passive reference dye. Specific PCR primers were designed for the amplification of about 200 bp products from TRB (selected in the TRBC region) and β-actin, used as an house-keeping gene. The primers were: RQTCRFR: 5′-GTCGACGCCAACAAATGG-3′ and RQTCRRV: 5′-AGACGCAGCCCTTGATGA-3′, RQACTFR: 5′-ATGTACGTTGCCATCC-3′ and RQACTRV: 5′-GAGATGCCACGCTCTC-3′, respectively. Approximately 20 ng of cDNA template was used in each PCR reaction. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 45 s. Triplicate reactions were performed for each template cDNA and the template was replaced with water in all blank control reactions. The analysis was carried out using the endpoints method option that causes the collection of the fluorescence data at the end of each extension stage of amplification. A relative quantitation has been performed, comparing the levels of the target transcript (TRB) to a reference transcript (calibrator, the tissue with the lowest TRB expression, in this case the head kidney). A normalizer target (β-actin) is included to correct for differences in total cDNA input between samples. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the results obtained from the ten considered fishes. The real-time PCR products from the different tissues were examined successively by agarose gel electrophoresis to investigate their specificity and size. 2.3 In vitro TRB expression analysis The in vitro TRB expression was studied by real time PCR using different stimulating conditions on head kidney (HK) leucocytes obtained from ten sea bream juveniles as described above. HK leucocytes were adjusted to 1 × 10 5 cells/ml and incubated at 18 °C for 4 h and 24 h with 5 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS from E. coli 0127:B8, Sigma) in PBS or with 1 μg/ml of lectin from Phaseolus vulgaris Leucoagglutinin (PHA-L from Sigma) in PBS. The control was stimulated with PBS only at the same time points. Total RNA was isolated with Tripure (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions, resuspended in DEPC treated water and used for real-time quantitative PCR without pooling the samples coming from the different fishes. The primers and the real time PCR conditions were the same as described above, except that the calibrator for these experiments was the time 0 control. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the results obtained from the 10 considered fishes and the differences from the control have been considered significant if p < 0.05 using the standard Student's t test. 2.4 3D modelling of sea bream V-BETA domains and MHC-I The 3D models of the six sea bream V-BETA domains (region 21–140) were created according to the homology modelling strategy using as templates the experimental human and murine structures of TRB complexed with HLA-A2 (PDB and IMGT/3Dstructure-DB code: 2gj6, chain E) ( Gagnon et al., 2006 ) and I-Ak proteins (PDB and IMGT/3Dstructure-DB code: 1g6r, chain B) ( Degano et al., 2000 ), respectively. As the sequence identities between the sea bream TRB chains and the human and murine homologous templates were close to 30%, i.e. from 28 to 34%, we used an accurate procedure already described ( Facchiano et al., 2001; Scapigliati et al., 2004; Buonocore et al., 2006, 2007 ). The MODELLER module ( Sali and Blundell, 1993 ) implemented in the Quanta molecular simulation package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to build 10 full-atom models of each TRB chain by setting 4.0 Å as root mean square deviation (RMSD) among initial models and by full models optimization. To select the best model, we used the PROCHECK program ( Laskowski et al., 1993 ) to evaluate their stereochemical and structural packing quality. The ProsaII program ( Sippl, 1993 ) was used to check the fitness of the sequences to the obtained structures and to assign a scoring function. Secondary structures were assigned by the DSSP program ( Kabsch and Sander, 1983 ). Search for structural classification was performed on CATH database ( Orengo et al., 1997; Pearl et al., 2000 ). The modelling of sea bream MHC-I (20-294 amino acid region, accession number DQ211541 ) was performed using as template the experimental human and murine structures of MHC-I complexed with TRB (PDB code: 2gj6, chain A, and 1g6r, chain H) ( Gagnon et al., 2006; Degano et al., 2000 ). The sequence identity percentages between sea bream and man/mouse resulted of 31 and 34%, respectively. The 3D structure of sea bream MHC-I was modelled and analysed with the same procedures and softwares used for TRB chains. 2.5 Simulation of sea bream V-BETA/MHC-I complexes The sea bream V-BETA/MHC-I complexes were created using as reference the experimental model of murine TR/pMHC-I ( Degano et al., 2000 ) and superimposing the sea bream MHC-I and V-BETA coordinates to those of the murine experimental complex. CVFF force field developed for the Insight II software was adopted to assign potentials and charges for the complexed proteins. The complexes were minimized by using 500 steps of energy minimization under conjugate gradient algorithm in order to optimise side chain conformations and avoid sterical clashes according to the procedures used in previous similar works ( Scapigliati et al., 2004; Costantini et al., 2005; Chambery et al., 2007; Costantini et al., 2007 ). To compare the protein-protein interaction in the complexes, the “Protein–Protein Interaction Server” ( Jones and Thornton, 1996 ) and the program NACCESS ( Hubbard et al., 1991 ) were used to evaluate the interface surface area and to identify the amino acids at the protein–receptor interface. H-bonds were calculated with Hbplus program ( McDonald and Thornton, 1994 ), that identifies H-bonds within a distance of 2.5 Å and a minimum angle of 90°. Moreover, the energy of interaction between MHC-I and V-BETA domains was also calculated by using the Energy/Intermolecular tool in the Docking module of Insight II and the binding free energy by using the DCOMPLEX program ( Liu et al., 2004 ). 3 Results 3.1 Sea bream TRB chain analysis PCR with degenerate primers TCNEFR and TCNERV gave a product of the expected size (219 bp) that when sequenced showed high homology for other known TRB chains (data not shown). 3′-RACE-PCR performed with TCRFR2 (based on the initial 219 bp sequence) and the adaptor primer gave a product of about 927 bp. 5′-RACE-PCR performed with TCRRV2 (based on the initial 219 bp sequence) and oligo- dG gave products of about 476 bp, with some differences in the sequences of the selected clones. The six full-length nucleotide cDNAs (EMBL accession numbers AM261209 ; AM261210 ; AM490435 ; AM490436 ; AM490437 ; AM490438 ) are comprised of about 1428 bp from the three overlapping products and have been confirmed by PCR using primers that amplify the complete coding sequences (data not shown). The six TRBV genes ( Fig. 1 , Panel A) belong to four different subgroups ( Fig. 1 , Panel B) using a 75% overall nucleotide identity to order the sequences in a pairwise similarity analysis of the V-REGION (comprised between the first codon and second cysteine residue in position 104, according to the IMGT unique numbering) ( Lefranc et al., 2003 ). An alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of the six S. aurata TRBV genes with other known TRBV sequences was assembled ( Fig. 2 ) to investigate the conservation of characteristic amino acid residues involved in structural domains. An analysis of the S. aurata sequences ( Fig. 2 ) showed the presence of different putative N -glycosylation sites in the six clones and no O -glycosylation sites. In the V-REGION, no N -glycosylation sites are present in clone 3, one is present in clone 1 (position 87–89 according to the IMGT numbering), clone 2 (position 14–16), clone 5 (position 22–24) and clone 6 (position 87–89), and two in clone 4 (position 16–18 and 24–26). Three sites are present in the C-DOMAIN of the six clones in positions 38–40, 110–112 and 120–122 according to the IMGT numbering. A similar situation for the putative glycosylation sites has been found in the channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) ( Wilson et al., 1998 ), in the Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) ( Hordvik et al., 1996 ) and in the Japanese flounder ( P. olivaceus ) ( Nam et al., 2003 ). Some amino acid residues are conserved in all the considered sequences ( Fig. 2 ) from fish to mammals and this should indicate their importance for the TRB chain functional activity. Two cysteines (C23 and C104) involved in an intrachain disulfide bond fundamental for the assembly of the V-BETA domain ( Wilson and Garcia, 1997 ) are conserved in sea bream, together with the motif Phe118-Gly119-X120-Gly121 (according to the IMGT unique numbering for V-DOMAIN) ( Lefranc et al., 2003 ) in the FR4-IMGT, typical of most TRB chains and Ig light chains ( Wilson et al., 1998; Lefranc et al., 2005b ). The C-BETA domain is the region that presents the highest homology between all considered sequences. The two cysteines (C147 and C212) that forms another intrachain disulfide bond ( Wilson and Garcia, 1997 ), the arginine of the motif Ser87-Arg88-Leu89, linked to the TR αβ interaction ( Arnaud et al., 1997 ), and the Glu13, which is thought to form an hydrophilic bond with the TRA chain ( Garcia et al., 1996 ), are also conserved in sea bream. On the contrary, the Cys residue in the connecting-region (CO) that in mammals ( Wilson and Garcia, 1997 ) is known to form an interchain disulfide bond with TRA chain is not present, as already observed in all known teleost sequences ( Hordvik et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1998; Wermenstam and Pilstrom, 2001; Nam et al., 2003 ). The CO region shows no conserved amino acids, while in the TM region the residue Lys (K) at position 5, that should be important for the TR αβ cell surface expression and for the assembly of the complex between TRB chain and CD3 ( Morley et al., 1988; Alcover et al., 1990 ), is present in sea bream. Phylogenetic analysis ( Fig. 3 ) conducted using V-REGION amino acid sequences of the six TRBV S. aurata genes and of some Oncorhynchus mykiss known sequences showed that clone 1, clone 5 and clone 6 cluster with the already available rainbow trout sequences, although in two different clusters, whether clone 2, clone 3 and clone 4 grouped in another cluster and so could correspond to a different subgroup. 3.2 Basal TRB expression analysis The expression analysis of TRB chain in organs and tissues of un-stimulated sea bream is shown in Fig. 4 . Real-time PCR products were loaded on agarose gels to exclude the formation of non-specific amplicons and single bands of the expected sizes were obtained. Moreover, to take into consideration the individual genetic variability ten different fishes were sampled and analysed separately. The highest TRB expression was detected in thymus, followed by gut. Lower TRB levels were observed in spleen, liver and gills. The head kidney showed the lowest expression level. 3.3 In vitro TRB expression analysis To investigate whether TRB chain expression levels could be modulated with LPS and PHA-L, in vitro stimulation of HK leucocytes for a short (4 h) and a longer (24 h) time was studied; RNA was extracted from the HK leucocytes of ten individuals analysed separately. Real-time PCR products were loaded on agarose gels and single bands of the expected sizes were obtained. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . Using LPS, a dramatic increase of TRB expression was detected at 4 h ( p < 0.05), whereas at 24 h ( p > 0.05) the mRNA level was similar to the control. When using PHA-L, a little decrease was observed both at 4 h and 24 h, although being not statistically significant. 3.4 3D Modelling of sea bream V-BETA domains and MHC-I In Fig. 6 , the 3D structure for the V-BETA domains clone 3 (the sequence with the highest similarity with human and murine templates) with its secondary structure elements and CDR is shown. About 50% of the residues in each sea bream V-BETA model folds in beta conformation, thus defining the global structure as “mainly beta” with immunoglobulin-like topology in agreement to the structural classification reported by CATH database ( Orengo et al., 1997 ) for the reference structures of human and murine V-BETA domains. In each V-BETA domain the position and orientation of two Cys residues make it possible that the structure is stabilized by an intrachain disulfide bond. The short 3 10 helix observed in both crystallographic human and murine structures is present also in all sea bream models. The V-BETA models were compared by superimposition of structurally conserved regions, obtaining RMSD values related to the differences in terms of secondary structures. RMSD values range between 0.42 and 0.99 Angstroms, indicating that these conformations present some structural differences, even if the overall 3D structure is conserved. Moreover, the CDR loops of the models were compared: the conformation of both CDR1 and CDR2 loops is conserved in all sea bream clones. The CDR3 loop in the clone 3 presents a different conformation with respect to other clones and this could mainly depend on its different length. The 3D MHC-I model ( Fig. 7 ) has a classical organization in three distinct domains (G-ALPHA1 [D1], G-ALPHA2 [D2] and C-LIKE [D3]) in agreement with the structural classification reported by CATH database ( Orengo et al., 1997; Pearl et al., 2000 ) for the crystallographic structures of human and murine MHC-I. The G-ALPHA1 [D1] and G-ALPHA2 [D2] domains are classified as “alpha-beta” and each consists of an alpha helical region and four strands of beta sheet in an anti-parallel orientation. The C-terminal domain (C-LIKE [D3]) has a “mainly beta” fold and is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich made of two anti-parallel sheets, each consisting of three main strands and few shorter strands, organized in Greek-keys motifs. In the sea bream MHC-I model four cysteine residues are located in the same positions of the human and murine templates and they should form two intrachain disulfide bonds, one in the G-ALPHA2 [D2] domain (Cys at positions 11 and 74 in the IMGT Collier de Perles, according to the IMGT unique numbering for G-DOMAIN) ( Lefranc et al., 2005a ) and the other in the C-LIKE [D3] domain (position 23 and 104 according to the IMGT unique numbering for C-DOMAIN and C-LIKE-DOMAIN) ( Lefranc et al., 2005b ). The sea bream MHC-I model was compared by structural superimposition with the two experimental structures used as templates, but the presence of gaps in the alignment made it difficult to perform a complete structural comparison of the three models (RMSD values of 1.12 and 0.96, respectively). However, the comparison of the secondary structures evidenced that the helices and beta-strands are conserved, with few external residues resulting added or excluded in some secondary structure elements and that the 3 10 helix present in human and murine structures is not conserved in the sea bream MHC-I model. 3.5 Simulation of sea bream V-BETA/MHC-1 complexes On the basis of the crystallographic structure of the murine V-BETA/MHC-1 complex we simulated the interaction between each of the six V-BETA domains and MHC-I in sea bream. For each complex we evaluated the interaction residues, the number of interchain H-bonds and the interface surface area ( Table 1 ). The interaction regions between the V-BETA and MHC-I in each complex are well conserved (data not shown) and, in particular, the amino acids of TRB chains at the interface with MHC-I are located in loop regions, whether the MHC-I ones are in helical regions. However, the number of interaction residues is different in the several complexes, due to the amino acid differences between the six sea bream V-BETA amino acid sequences. The value of interface surface area and the number of interchain H-bonds resulted the highest for the complex between V-BETA clone 3 and MHC-I (see Table 1 ); the other complexes show little differences in the interface surface area values and variable numbers of interchain H-bonds. 4 Discussion The heterodimeric, membrane anchored TR αβ endows the cell with antigen specific reactivity and this molecule has been extensively studied in mammals. Fish, like all jawed vertebrates, can develop cell mediated immunity and the knowledge on fish TRB genes has increased rapidly in recent years. In this paper we report the homology cloning of the TRB chain from sea bream ( S. aurata ), and analysed its expression and 3D structure model, with a particular interest to the interactions with MHC-I. Six different TRB cDNAs were isolated from the thymus of a juvenile sea bream and the predicted amino acid sequences were studied to evidence the presence of conserved structures. The J region motif ( Moss and Bell, 1995 ), F-G-X-G, and the Cys involved in mammals in two intrachain disulfide bonds in the V domain and in the C domain are conserved in all sea bream sequences (see Fig. 1 ). The Cys that in mammals is involved in an interchain disulfide bond with TRA is not present in sea bream, but some authors ( Arnaud et al., 1997 ) demonstrated that it may be not important for the dimerisation of the TR αβ heterodimer. On the contrary, the amino acid motif (85.2YCLSSRLRVSA93) that the same authors proposed to be involved in the TR αβ chain interaction and cell surface expression, is partially conserved in all sequences. Therefore, the amino acids (the Y85.2 and the stretch 87SRL89) that in this motif are retained from fish to mammals should be fundamental for the structure/function relationship in TRB chains. The conserved antigen receptor transmembrane (CART) motif ( Campbell et al., 1994 ), made mainly of polar or aromatic amino acids, is present in sea bream TM sequences like in all teleost TRB chains. It should encode a structural unit with an important role in the assembly and/or signalling of the TR αβ/CD3 complex ( Campbell et al., 1994 ). In particular, the two tyrosine residues (Y-265 and Y-275), that have been identified to have a fundamental role in the signalling of TR αβ towards the ξ subunit of CD3 ( Fuller-Espie et al., 1998 ) in mammals, are conserved in sea bream. Real-time PCR analysis detected high levels of constitutive TRB expression in thymus (see Fig. 4 ), as already observed in cod ( Wermenstam and Pilstrom, 2001 ) and rainbow trout ( Partula et al., 1995 ), followed by gut, in contrast to what was detected in cod ( Wermenstam and Pilstrom, 2001 ), where no expression was found in the intestine. However, the gut is a tissue with a certain number of T cells ( Romano et al., 2007 ) and deeply involved in fish immune responses and leukocytes ontogeny as demonstrated in rainbow trout ( Bernard et al., 2006 ), sea bass and carp ( Rombout et al., 2005 ). In vitro TRB expression was studied using sea bream head kidney leukocyte cells with the stimulant LPS, to simulate a pathogen infection, or the cell mitogen agent PHA-L. LPS induced an high TRB expression in sea bream after 4 h as observed also in vivo on mice ( Tough et al., 1997 ), whether PHA-L showed no effect both after 4 h and 24 h. Probably, this last result was due to the stimulation period that was too short, as in the Pagrus auratus ( Morrison et al., 2004 ) leukocyte proliferation was induced significantly by PHA-L only after 72 h. 3D structural modelling of sea bream V-BETA domains showed that the beta-strands and the CDR1, CDR2 loops are well conserved in all clones but the conformation of CDR3 is different in clone 3 with respect to the other clones. The simulation of the complexes between the V-BETA domains and the sea bream MHC-I gave us the opportunity to study the amino acid residues at the interaction surface. Furthermore, for each complex we have evaluated the binding energy and interaction energy ( Fig. 8 ) and the best values have been obtained for the complex with TRB clone 3: this complex showed also the highest value of interface surface area and the highest number of interchain H-bonds (see Table 1 ). This result could be due to the different orientation of CDR3 loop that is known to show large conformational changes upon binding and modulate the interaction with the peptide and MHC-I providing a mechanism of structural plasticity to accommodate a variety of different peptide antigens ( Garcia et al., 1998 ). In conclusion, the availability of sea bream TRB chain sequences will add a new tool to analyse fish immune responses to viral and parasitic infections and will be of relevance to study the phylogeny and evolution of specific antigen receptors. Moreover, the investigation on the V-BETA/MHC-1 complexes will help to obtain information about the putative amino acid residues at the interaction surfaces. The step forward will be the search of an experimental testing to assess the 3D structures reliability: probably it could be possible to make some synthetic peptides that should block the interactions between TR αβ and MHC-I, based on the conserved amino acid residues at the interaction surfaces, and investigate if these peptides are able to modulate sea bream immune responses.
