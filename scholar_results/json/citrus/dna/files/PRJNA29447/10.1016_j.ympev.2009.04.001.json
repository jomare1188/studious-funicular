    "full_text": "We entirely sequenced two new hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes ( Cephus cinctus and Orussus occidentalis ), and a substantial portion of another three hymenopterans ( Schlettererius cinctipes , Venturia canescens , and Enicospilus ). We analyze them together with nine others reported in the literature. We establish that the rate of genetic divergence is two to three times higher among some Hymenoptera when compared with others, making this a group with both long and short phylogenetic branches. We then assessed the ability of a range of phylogenetic approaches to recover seven uncontroversial relationships, when lineages show markedly different rates of molecular evolution. This range encompassed maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis of (i) amino acid data, (ii) nucleotide data, and (iii) nucleotide data excluding third codon positions. Unpartitioned analyses were compared with partitioned analyses, with the data partitioned by codon position (ribosomal genes were placed in a separate partition). These analyses indicated that partitioned, Bayesian analysis of nucleotide data, excluding 3rd codon positions, recovered more of the uncontroversial relationships than any other approach. These results suggest that the analysis of complete mitochondrial genome sequences holds promise for the resolution of hymenopteran superfamily relationships."

          "The Hymenoptera are one of the largest insect orders, comprising over 100,000 described species ( LaSalle and Gauld, 1993b ). They are also one of the most biologically diverse, containing phytophagous, various grades of social, and a range of parasitic species ( LaSalle and Gauld, 1993a ). The parasitic species are particularly diverse, with ectoparasitic, endoparasitic, solitary, gregarious, klepto- and secondary or hyperparasitoids just some of the variations that have been described. It is likely that a large proportion of the Hymenoptera remain undescribed (e.g. Grissell, 1999 ). Some authors suggest that they may constitute as much as 10% of all species of life ( Sharkey, 2008 ).",
          "A number of studies have attempted to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the order ( Rasnitsyn, 1980, 1988; Dowton and Austin, 1994, 2001; Ronquist et al., 1999; Sharkey and Roy, 2002; Castro and Dowton, 2006 ). Although the cladogram derived from the most recent analysis contains a range of nodes that are well supported, there are also many that remain poorly resolved, despite the inclusion of four gene fragments (both mitochondrial and nuclear) from 87 taxa ( Castro and Dowton, 2006 ). Entire mitochondrial genomes represent one source of additional data that might help resolve relationships among the Hymenoptera.",
          "To date, nine complete or nearly complete hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes have been reported. However, the majority (6) of these are from the predominantly social, aculeate wasps. In some cases, this focussed taxonomic sampling was deliberate, in order to test the ability of mitochondrial genome data to recover an uncontentious phylogeny ( Castro et al., 2006 ). However, this also resulted in a sampling of taxa that does not represent the full range of hymenopteran lineages. Just two mitochondrial genomes have been reported from the remaining nonaculeate apocritans ( Vanhornia and Nasonia ; Castro et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2008 ), with only one of these ( Vanhornia ) having ever been included in a phylogenetic analysis ( Cameron et al., 2008 ). Outside of the Apocrita, only a single symphytan mitochondrial genome has been sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically ( Castro and Dowton, 2005 ) Thus, prior mitochondrial genome analyses have included a poor representation of the parasitic Hymenoptera.",
          "Here, we perform phylogenetic analyses of complete mitochondrial genome sequences from a much broader range of Hymenoptera than has previously been reported. This sample includes six newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes, five from our own laboratories ( Cephus , Orussus , Schlettererius , Venturia , Enicospilus ), while another is from Nasonia ( Oliveira et al., 2008 ). Importantly, two of the newly sequenced genomes are from the Symphyta, and represent distinct lineages (Cephoidea and Orussoidea) in this paraphyletic grade ( Vilhelmsen, 1997, 2001; Schulmeister, 2003 ). The four newly sequenced apocritans are all parasitic. One of these ( Schlettererius ) has been proposed as the sister group to the remaining Apocrita ( Gibson, 1985; Johnson, 1988; Whitfield et al., 1989; Vilhelmsen, 2001 ), although recent molecular analyses do not support this hypothesis ( Castro and Dowton, 2006 ). We now have 14 representatives from 10 families, whereas our previous analyses included just eight representatives from five families ( Cameron et al., 2008 ).",
          "The ability of a range of phylogenetic approaches to resolve within-insect order relationships has been examined using mitochondrial genome sequence data; in the Diptera ( Cameron et al., 2007 ), the Orthoptera ( Fenn et al., 2008 ) and in the Hymenoptera ( Castro and Dowton, 2007 ). The hymenopteran order represents a particularly challenging mitochondrial phylogeny to resolve, due to the presence of both rapidly evolving, and more slowly evolving groups ( Dowton and Austin, 1995 ).",
          "In this paper, we report the results of phylogenetic analyses of these 14 hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes. Although our taxon sampling is insufficient to comprehensively resolve the phylogeny of the Hymenoptera, our purpose here was to test the ability of a range of approaches to resolve relationships, particularly when the rate of genetic divergence is vastly different among members of the ingroup."

Not all genomes were entirely sequenced. Cephus and Orussus were sequenced entirely, while Enicospilus , Schlettererius , and Venturia were incomplete, presumably in the area surrounding the AT-rich region, which has proven difficult to amplify in the Hymenoptera ( Castro and Dowton, 2005; Castro et al., 2006; Cameron et al., 2008 ). At most, the incomplete genomes are missing one to two genes. We do not anticipate that these missing data have a significant impact on our analyses.

              "For Cephus , Orussus , and Enicospilus , genomes were assembled using Sequencher 4.6 (GeneCodes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). For Venturia and Schlettererius , genomes were assembled using ChromasPro (v. 1.33; Technelysium Ltd., Tewantin, Australia). tRNA genes were identified using tRNA-Scan SE version 1.21 (lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE) ( Lowe and Eddy, 1997 ). In Cephus , Orussus , and Enicospilus , protein-coding genes were identified as described by Sheffield et al. (2008) . In Venturia and Schlettererius , protein-coding genes were identified using ORF finder (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), followed by BlastP analysis (implemented from within ORF finder). BlastN was used to identify rRNA genes. The precise ends of the 16S and 12S rRNA genes are difficult to define. 16S and 12S are most generally defined as being bounded by neighboring tRNA genes (i.e. with no noncoding sequence between the ribosomal genes and the tRNA genes that lie either side). We have followed this practice here. However, the 5′ end of the 12S gene is more difficult to define, as one end is usually bounded by the main noncoding region. The motif generally present in other insects (TTNAAGTTNTAARANCG; Stewart and Beckenbach, 2006 ) was not present in all of the sequences used here. Instead, we identified a more highly conserved sequence motif situated approximately 100 bases from the very end of the 12S gene (between the 12S gene and the noncoding region), and excluded bases beyond this motif from the analyses. This motif has the sequence 5′-TGCTGGCAC-3′ (but note that this is on the J-strand, and represents the reverse complement of the corresponding sequence in the 12S rRNA gene product). It is easily recognized in all holometabolous insects examined in this study. By way of reference, this motif is at position 14738–14746 of the Drosophila melanogaster (GenBank Accession NC_001709) mitochondrial genome."

Although additional genomes have become available since that time, none of these represent additional ingroup sequences. We already have 30 outgroup sequences, and we consider this sufficient for these analyses. Xenos , from the order Strepsiptera, was not included. Pilot analyses indicated that this taxon behaved anomalously, tending to be recovered within the Hymenoptera. In addition, where multiple representatives from the same genus were available, we used a single representative. The taxa used, together with their GenBank Accession numbers, are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . As with previous studies ( Castro and Dowton, 2007; Cameron et al., 2008 ), two nonholometabolous insects were used to root the analyses. These were Triatoma (NC_002609) and Philaenus (NC_005944), both from the Hemiptera.",
              "MEGA (v. 4) ( Tamura et al., 2007 ) was used to both download and align the protein-coding (nucleotide) and ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Conveniently, MEGA can translate the protein-coding nucleotide sequences using the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code, align the resulting amino acid sequences using Clustal ( Chenna et al., 2003 ), then create a nucleotide sequence using the amino acid sequence as a guide. We used this approach to align all protein-coding genes. We are aware that some holometabolous insects may use a slight modification of the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code ( Abascal et al., 2006 ). However, examination of our alignments suggested no evidence of misalignment due to the putatively altered genetic code.",
              "The ClustalW settings for the protein-coding genes were as follows; pairwise alignment parameters: gap open penalty = 10, extension penalty = 0.1; multiple alignment parameters: gap open penalty = 10, extension penalty = 0.2; protein weight matrix = Gonnet; residue specific penalties = on; hydrophobic penalties = on; gap separation distance = 4; end gap separation = off; negative matrix = off; delay divergent cut-off = 30%. The ClustalW settings for the ribosomal RNA genes were; pairwise alignment parameters: gap opening penalty = 15, extension penalty = 6.66; the multiple alignment parameters were: gap opening penalty = 15, extension penalty = 6.66; DNA weight matrix = IUB; transition weight = 0.5; negative matrix = off; delay divergent cut-off = 30%.

In the first, we calculated K a (the nonsynonymous substitution rate) and K s (the synonymous substitution rate). Both were calculated using the K a K s calculator (v. 1.2) ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). We used model averaging to calculate K a ( Posada and Buckley, 2004 ). In the second measure, we extracted branch length estimates from the most likely tree, after Bayesian analysis of the data. Branch lengths were conveniently displayed on this tree, using FigTree (v. 1). We then manually calculated the branch length for each taxon, from the tip to the ancestral node for the Hymenoptera."

Bayesian analyses were conducted using MrBayes (v. 3.1.2) ( Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003 ). The model of analysis was chosen using MrModelTest ( Nylander, 2004 ), using the AIC criterion. For the vast majority of partitions, the GTR + G + I model (nst = 6, rates = invgamma) was chosen as the model that best fit the data, particularly for the partitions that were likely to be least saturated (1st codon, 2nd codon), and would thus be less prone to errors in estimation of the model. For consistency, we applied this model to all partitions. Partitioned analyses were conducted with each partition unlinked [unlink statefreq = (all); unlink revmat = (all); unlink shape = (all); unlink pinvar = (all); prset applyto = (all) ratepr = variable].",

Four independent runs of 2,000,000 generations were performed, with trees sampled every 100 generations. Each run started from a random tree. Convergence (or burnin: lack of improvement in likelihood scores) was assessed by examining the plot of generation against the likelihood scores. Convergence was then confirmed using the sump command in MrBayes. Trees sampled prior to convergence were discarded before construction of the majority consensus tree. The percentage of sampled trees recovering a particular clade was used as a measure of that clade’s posterior probability ( Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 )."

Although we will report on the organization of the five new hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes elsewhere, the organization of the genes that we analyze here (protein-coding and ribosomal RNA) are not substantially different. In four of them, all protein-coding and rRNA genes are in identical positions [compared with the putative ancestral organization for the Holometabola ( Dowton et al., 2002 )]. In one of them ( Venturia ), there is a block inversion that encompasses three protein-coding genes. However, we include a close relative of Venturia ( Enicospilus , another member of the Ichneumonidae) that does not have this inversion, and the two were always recovered as sisters. Thus, we do not expect that gene rearrangement had an impact on our phylogenetic analyses."

              "The Hymenoptera represent a challenging phylogeny to recover, particularly when using mitochondrial genes, due to the very different rates in their evolution among members. A previous study indicated a significant increase in the rate of genetic divergence of apocritan mitochondrial genes when compared with symphytan mitochondrial genes, and that symphytans were about as divergent as other Holometabola ( Dowton and Austin, 1995 ). However, this study was based on just two gene fragments (COI and 16S). Maximum likelihood differences were approximately 1.5 times higher for the Apocrita when compared with the basally divergent symphytan for the 16S gene, and about two times higher for COI amino acid sequences ( Dowton and Austin, 1995 ).",
              "In this study, we examined whether these trends were reproduced when complete mitochondrial sequences were compared. We measured K a and K s for each taxon investigated here, with calculations based on comparisons with the Drosophila mitochondrial genome ( Table 2 ). Although the choice of nonhymenopteran taxon might seem arbitrary, it should not bias the results, as it is the same for all hymenopteran taxa. Also, our phylogenetic analyses indicate that branch lengths among the Holometabola are remarkably uniform (except those for the Hymenoptera), such that any holometabolous taxon would make an appropriate comparison.",
              "These comparisons indicate that (i) K s is saturated, with levels ranging between 5 and 10 and (ii) K a is lowest (0.26) for the earliest diverging symphytan ( Perga ), and generally higher for the other Hymenoptera (range 0.40–0.52). These comparisons indicate that the trends observed earlier are found when the entire mitochondrial genome is analyzed. Nevertheless, we consider these comparisons preliminary. The best comparisons of relative divergences come from comparison of branch lengths in the phylogenetic trees. These were examined after phylogenetic analysis (see below), and confirm the trends observed here."

              "We previously reported that a ‘test’ phylogeny of the Hymenoptera, one using taxa whose phylogenetic placements were known with relative certainty, was only recovered (i) when the analyses used nucleotide sequences (rather than amino acid sequences) and (ii) when the analyses employed a Bayesian approach (rather than maximum parsimony) ( Castro and Dowton, 2007 ). Outgroup composition was also found to be critical. The test phylogeny was only recovered when a broad range of holometabolous insects were used as outgroups. There was one exception to this trend. Bayesian analysis of nucelotide data, in which the third codon position was excluded, was able to recover the test phylogeny when only a single outgroup taxon was used.",
              "However, these findings may be influenced by the composition of the ingroup. The test phylogeny purposefully did not include taxa from a range of hymenopteran groups, because their positions are uncertain. Due to the broader sample of hymenopterans examined here, we reinvestigated the ability of various approaches to recover phylogeny. Indeed, we hoped that a larger sampling of ingroup taxa may relieve the necessity to broadly sample the outgroup. Although we do not know the phylogeny that should be recovered in this study, a subset of the relationships are well established. These uncontroversial relationships are, (i) the Aculeata should be monophyletic ( Rasnitsyn, 1980, 1988; Brothers and Carpenter, 1993; Sharkey, 2008 ), (ii) Cephus should be the second-most basally derived taxon (with Perga the most basal taxon) ( Rasnitsyn, 1988; Vilhelmsen, 1997, 2001; Schulmeister, 2003; Sharkey, 2008 ), (iii) Orussus should be sister to the Apocrita ( Rasnitsyn, 1980, 1988; Vilhelmsen, 2001; Schulmeister, 2003; Sharkey, 2008 ), and (iv) the two ichneumonids should be monophyletic ( Königsmann, 1978; Rasnitsyn, 1980, 1988; Sharkey and Wahl, 1992 ). The uncontroversial relationships used to assess the various phylogenetic approaches are listed in Table 3 .",
              "We performed phylogenetic analyses (i) using just the hymenopteran representatives, employing the earliest diverging hymenopteran included here ( Perga , based on the tree presented by Vilhelmsen, 2001 ) as the outgroup and (ii) using all representatives from the Holometabola for which complete mitochondrial genome data were available (on the 1st October, 2008, when analyses were started). In the latter case, two nonholometabolous insects (Hemiptera) were used as the outgroups ( Triatoma and Philaenus : order Hemiptera). The range of approaches attempted were (i) analysis of amino acid sequence data, (ii) analysis of nucleotide sequence data from all protein-coding genes (including all codon positions) and rRNA genes, and (iii) analysis of first and second codon positions from the protein-coding genes, together with rRNA genes. We performed each of these analyses employing both maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis. For the latter, we partitioned the data into 1st codon, 2nd codon, 3rd codon, and rRNA (i.e. 12S and 16S combined) and analyzed them unlinked. We investigated variations on this partitioning strategy later in the study.",
              "The results of the analyses when the earliest diverging hymenopteran ( Perga ) was used as the ougroup are listed in Table 4 . None of the approaches recovered all of the uncontroversial relationships. Amino acid sequence data generally recovered more of the uncontroversial relationships than other approaches, but only within the Apocrita. None of the approaches were able to place Primeuchroeus appropriately. This was always recovered with the outgroup, and consequently not with the other Aculeata ( Table 4 ). Both of the included symphytans ( Cephus and Orussus ) were always misplaced.",
              "Similarly, when a range of Holometabola were included, most analyses were still unable to recover all relationships ( Table 5 ), although many of the analyses recovered more of the uncontroversial relationships. A Bayesian approach, including 3rd codon positions, recovered all but one of the uncontroversial relationships, the sister grouping of Vanhornia and Nasonia . This was the least frequently recovered relationship among these analyses. The expected placement of Primeuchroeus , sister to the remaining aculeates, was generally improved with the inclusion of a broad set of outgroup taxa. The impact of multiple outgroups is most apparent when analyses that excluded the 3rd codon position are compared. For MP analyses, just three of the seven uncontroversial relationships are recovered when Perga is used as the ougroup, while five are recovered when the broader outgroups are used. For the Bayesian analysis, the improvement is greater, with just three relationships recovered when Perga is the outroup, but all are recovered with multiple outgroups. Many of these trends are similar to those obtained after simulation studies ( Hall, 2005 )."

              "Given that partitioned Bayesian analyses appeared able to recover a number of uncontroversial relationships across the range of divergences within the Hymenoptera, we next examined the impact of various partitioning strategies (including an absence of partitioning). Partitioning the data facilitates the optimization of the likelihood among sites that are putatively evolving under similar evolutionary conditions. In order to compare partitioning strategies, we used Bayes factors. In this approach, Bayes factors are the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of two alternate hypotheses. The Bayes factor is calculated by multiplying the difference between the natural logarithms of the two harmonic means by two. If this number is greater than 10, it is taken as strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis with the higher likelihood score.",
              "The range of partitioning strategies used here are outlined in Table 6 . We employed an incremental approach to partitioning (from very simple to highly partitioned), in order to examine the influence of each element of the partitioning approach to the analysis.",
              "Examination of the trees recovered from these analyses indicated that each analysis produced identical topologies, with respect to hymenopteran relationships. In each case, all seven uncontroversial relationships were recovered. The likelihood was significantly improved with each increase in the number of data partitions ( Table 7 ), as has been observed by others ( Mueller et al., 2004; Brandley et al., 2005; Castoe and Parkinson, 2006 ). The impact of each incremental increase in the number of partitions can be seen by comparing the Bayes factors along the diagonal of Table 7 . These are the numbers that compare P1 with P2, P2 with P3, and so on. This reveals that the smallest improvement was seen with partitioning the ribosomal genes separately (compare P2 with P3 in Table 7 ), producing a Bayes factor of 84. The greatest improvement was seen when an unpartitioned strategy (P1) was compared with a minimally partitioned strategy (P2: 1st codon, 2nd codon, rRNA genes), producing a Bayes factor of 6430. In any case, all partitioning strategies were judged to significantly improve the likelihood score. Others have noted that this metric appears lenient ( Brown and Lemmon, 2007 ); a Bayes factor of only 10 is all that is needed to accept one partitioned strategy over another, yet we and others ( Mueller et al., 2004; Brandley et al., 2005; Castoe and Parkinson, 2006 ) regularly observe Bayses factors higher than 1000. But this does not seem to be the case: a Bayes factor cutoff of 10 did not lead to a high false positive rate (i.e. accepting overly partitioned analyses), when both simulated and real datasets were analyzed ( Brown and Lemmon, 2007 ). Indeed, Bayes factors behaved remarkably well, giving a false positive rate of 5% ( Brown and Lemmon, 2007 ).",
              "On a practical note, convergence took considerably longer with the heavily partitioned analyses, as previously reported for orthopteran mitochondrial genomes ( Fenn et al., 2008 ). For example, convergence was judged to have occurred after just 5000 generations with the P1–P4 analyses (which had between 1 and 5 partitions), but not until 500,000 generations with the P5 analysis (28 partitions)."

              "For the reasons outlined above, we present the tree produced from the analysis that gave the highest likelihood score, i.e. from the P5 analysis ( Fig. 1 ). Each of the included holometabolous orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera) were recovered as monophyletic, with BPPs (Baysian posterior probability) of 1.00. The Hymenoptera were recovered as the sister group to the Lepidoptera + Diptera, but with a BPP of only 0.80. We consider that the taxon sampling of the other holometabolous orders is too depauperate to adequately investigate holometabolous relationships, particularly as the sister group varies under different analytical schemes ( Castro and Dowton, 2005; Cameron et al., 2008 ). Rather, we restrict our observations to those among the Hymenoptera, for which the analytical approach was optimized. This tree ( Fig. 2 ) indicates that the Apocrita have a much accelerated rate of genetic divergence (compared with the basally diverging symphytans – here represented by Perga and Cephus ) in the entire mitochondrial genome, as was reported previously for two mitochondrial gene fragments ( Dowton and Austin, 1995 ). Branch lengths for each exemplar (calculated for each taxon, from the tip to the ancestral node for the Hymenoptera) appear in Table 2 . We consider that the tree-based estimate is the best indication of the degree of genetic divergence, as it is based on the model that best fits each of the data partitions. The tree-based estimate suggests that the Apocrita generally have two to three times the genetic divergence of Perga . This is almost double the rate differential compared with that calculated using K a . This confirms our suspicion that K a is not adequately accounting for hidden change. Indeed, the largest K a values (and longest branch lengths) are for the aculeate taxa, and this is the group most heavily sampled. The higher taxon sampling is likely to result in better genetic divergence estimates, for both K a and Bayesian branch length approaches.",
              "Excluding the uncontroversial relationships, examination of the trees recovered under each of the partitioning strategies indicates that they are identical, perhaps an indication that we have reached the limit of resolution with this particular dataset. The Ichneumonidae are always recovered as the sister group to the stephanid. Although the BPP for this relationship is low for the unpartitioned analysis (P1) at 0.71, it is generally high for all of the partitioned analyses (range 0.94–0.98). This relationship is contrary to that resolved by our most recent taxon-rich, multigene analysis ( Castro and Dowton, 2006 ), in which the stephanids were recovered closer to the Aculeata than to the Ichneumonidae. Although the level of support for this latter relationship was lower in the taxon-rich analysis (BPP = 0.88), we consider this a better estimate of phylogenetic relationships among the Hymenoptera, due to the higher level of taxonomic sampling.",
              "With respect to the only other controversial relationship examined here, the proctotrupomorphs were more variably recovered as sister to the ichneumonids plus stephanid. The BPP for this relationship was lower, at 0.79, for the analysis shown in Fig. 1 , but was generally low across the partitioned strategies (range 0.57–0.79). The reason for this was that the post burnin trees included ones with other relationships. In some of the post burnin trees, the Aculeata were recovered with the ichneumonids and the stephanid (BPP = 0.15), while in others, just the ichneumonids and Aculeata were recovered (BPP = 0.06).",
              "We consider these relationships as tentative only – the primary goal of this investigation was to establish analytical approaches for the analysis of mitochondrial genome data, when branch lengths differ substantially among groups. We consider that the analytical approach adopted here achieves that aim. Pleasingly, the approach supported by our study (partitioned Bayesian analysis of nucleotide data, excluding 3rd codon positions) shares a number of similarities with those proposed for other groups, ones that do not have such disparate rates of genetic divergence. For example, analysis of dipteran mitochondrial genomes indicated that relationships were robust to the analytical approach, with parsimony and Bayesian analyses recovering identical ingroup topologies ( Cameron et al., 2007 ). In this study, partitioned Bayesian analyses outperformed other approaches, although the inclusion of 3rd codon positions was found to provide additional phylogenetic signal ( Cameron et al., 2007 ). Similarly, analysis of orthopteran mitochondrial genomes suggested that partitioned Bayesian analysis of all nucleotide data (including 3rd codon positions) outperformed both maximum parsimony and unpartitioned Bayesian analyses ( Fenn et al., 2008 ). However, exclusion of 3rd codon positions had no effect on topology, in either the orthopteran or dipteran study. Taken together, these findings suggest that a single analytical approach may be feasible for the mitochondrial genomes of holometabolous and related insects, one involving partitioned Bayesian analysis with the exclusion of 3rd codon positions. Establishing this will ultimately rest on the generation of mitochondrial genome sequence data from the remaining holometabolous (i.e. outside of the Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera) insect orders."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction The Hymenoptera are one of the largest insect orders, comprising over 100,000 described species ( LaSalle and Gauld, 1993b ). They are also one of the most biologically diverse, containing phytophagous, various grades of social, and a range of parasitic species ( LaSalle and Gauld, 1993a ). The parasitic species are particularly diverse, with ectoparasitic, endoparasitic, solitary, gregarious, klepto- and secondary or hyperparasitoids just some of the variations that have been described. It is likely that a large proportion of the Hymenoptera remain undescribed (e.g. Grissell, 1999 ). Some authors suggest that they may constitute as much as 10% of all species of life ( Sharkey, 2008 ). A number of studies have attempted to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the order ( Rasnitsyn, 1980, 1988; Dowton and Austin, 1994, 2001; Ronquist et al., 1999; Sharkey and Roy, 2002; Castro and Dowton, 2006 ). Although the cladogram derived from the most recent analysis contains a range of nodes that are well supported, there are also many that remain poorly resolved, despite the inclusion of four gene fragments (both mitochondrial and nuclear) from 87 taxa ( Castro and Dowton, 2006 ). Entire mitochondrial genomes represent one source of additional data that might help resolve relationships among the Hymenoptera. To date, nine complete or nearly complete hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes have been reported. However, the majority (6) of these are from the predominantly social, aculeate wasps. In some cases, this focussed taxonomic sampling was deliberate, in order to test the ability of mitochondrial genome data to recover an uncontentious phylogeny ( Castro et al., 2006 ). However, this also resulted in a sampling of taxa that does not represent the full range of hymenopteran lineages. Just two mitochondrial genomes have been reported from the remaining nonaculeate apocritans ( Vanhornia and Nasonia ; Castro et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2008 ), with only one of these ( Vanhornia ) having ever been included in a phylogenetic analysis ( Cameron et al., 2008 ). Outside of the Apocrita, only a single symphytan mitochondrial genome has been sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically ( Castro and Dowton, 2005 ) Thus, prior mitochondrial genome analyses have included a poor representation of the parasitic Hymenoptera. Here, we perform phylogenetic analyses of complete mitochondrial genome sequences from a much broader range of Hymenoptera than has previously been reported. This sample includes six newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes, five from our own laboratories ( Cephus , Orussus , Schlettererius , Venturia , Enicospilus ), while another is from Nasonia ( Oliveira et al., 2008 ). Importantly, two of the newly sequenced genomes are from the Symphyta, and represent distinct lineages (Cephoidea and Orussoidea) in this paraphyletic grade ( Vilhelmsen, 1997, 2001; Schulmeister, 2003 ). The four newly sequenced apocritans are all parasitic. One of these ( Schlettererius ) has been proposed as the sister group to the remaining Apocrita ( Gibson, 1985; Johnson, 1988; Whitfield et al., 1989; Vilhelmsen, 2001 ), although recent molecular analyses do not support this hypothesis ( Castro and Dowton, 2006 ). We now have 14 representatives from 10 families, whereas our previous analyses included just eight representatives from five families ( Cameron et al., 2008 ). The ability of a range of phylogenetic approaches to resolve within-insect order relationships has been examined using mitochondrial genome sequence data; in the Diptera ( Cameron et al., 2007 ), the Orthoptera ( Fenn et al., 2008 ) and in the Hymenoptera ( Castro and Dowton, 2007 ). The hymenopteran order represents a particularly challenging mitochondrial phylogeny to resolve, due to the presence of both rapidly evolving, and more slowly evolving groups ( Dowton and Austin, 1995 ). In this paper, we report the results of phylogenetic analyses of these 14 hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes. Although our taxon sampling is insufficient to comprehensively resolve the phylogeny of the Hymenoptera, our purpose here was to test the ability of a range of approaches to resolve relationships, particularly when the rate of genetic divergence is vastly different among members of the ingroup. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Specimens and DNA extraction The list of hymenopteran taxa included in this study is shown in Table 1 . Of those that were newly sequenced for this study, Cephus cinctus Norton, Orussus occidentalis (Cresson), and Enicospilus sp. were sequenced in the laboratory of SLC and MFW, while Schlettererius cinctipes (Cresson) and Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst) were sequenced in the laboratory of MD. DNA was extracted from Cephus , Orussus , and Enicospilus as described by Sheffield et al. (2008) , while it was extracted from Schlettererius and Venturia as previously described by Castro and Dowton (2005) . 2.2 Amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial genome fragments Cephus , Orussus and Enicospilus were amplified and sequenced as described by Cameron et al. (2007) , while those for Schlettererius and Venturia have also been previously documented by Castro et al. (2006) . Generally, long fragments were sequenced by primer walking; primer sequences can be obtained from the SC ( Cephus , Orussus , Enicospilus ) or MD ( Venturia , Schlettererius ). Not all genomes were entirely sequenced. Cephus and Orussus were sequenced entirely, while Enicospilus , Schlettererius , and Venturia were incomplete, presumably in the area surrounding the AT-rich region, which has proven difficult to amplify in the Hymenoptera ( Castro and Dowton, 2005; Castro et al., 2006; Cameron et al., 2008 ). At most, the incomplete genomes are missing one to two genes. We do not anticipate that these missing data have a significant impact on our analyses. The sequences are available from GenBank, under Accession numbers FJ478173 – FJ478177 . 2.3 Contig assembly and genome annotation For Cephus , Orussus , and Enicospilus , genomes were assembled using Sequencher 4.6 (GeneCodes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). For Venturia and Schlettererius , genomes were assembled using ChromasPro (v. 1.33; Technelysium Ltd., Tewantin, Australia). tRNA genes were identified using tRNA-Scan SE version 1.21 (lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE) ( Lowe and Eddy, 1997 ). In Cephus , Orussus , and Enicospilus , protein-coding genes were identified as described by Sheffield et al. (2008) . In Venturia and Schlettererius , protein-coding genes were identified using ORF finder (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), followed by BlastP analysis (implemented from within ORF finder). BlastN was used to identify rRNA genes. The precise ends of the 16S and 12S rRNA genes are difficult to define. 16S and 12S are most generally defined as being bounded by neighboring tRNA genes (i.e. with no noncoding sequence between the ribosomal genes and the tRNA genes that lie either side). We have followed this practice here. However, the 5′ end of the 12S gene is more difficult to define, as one end is usually bounded by the main noncoding region. The motif generally present in other insects (TTNAAGTTNTAARANCG; Stewart and Beckenbach, 2006 ) was not present in all of the sequences used here. Instead, we identified a more highly conserved sequence motif situated approximately 100 bases from the very end of the 12S gene (between the 12S gene and the noncoding region), and excluded bases beyond this motif from the analyses. This motif has the sequence 5′-TGCTGGCAC-3′ (but note that this is on the J-strand, and represents the reverse complement of the corresponding sequence in the 12S rRNA gene product). It is easily recognized in all holometabolous insects examined in this study. By way of reference, this motif is at position 14738–14746 of the Drosophila melanogaster (GenBank Accession NC_001709) mitochondrial genome. 2.4 Sequence alignment Complete mitochondrial genome sequences from all sequenced holometabolous insects were obtained from GenBank in October 2008. Although additional genomes have become available since that time, none of these represent additional ingroup sequences. We already have 30 outgroup sequences, and we consider this sufficient for these analyses. Xenos , from the order Strepsiptera, was not included. Pilot analyses indicated that this taxon behaved anomalously, tending to be recovered within the Hymenoptera. In addition, where multiple representatives from the same genus were available, we used a single representative. The taxa used, together with their GenBank Accession numbers, are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . As with previous studies ( Castro and Dowton, 2007; Cameron et al., 2008 ), two nonholometabolous insects were used to root the analyses. These were Triatoma (NC_002609) and Philaenus (NC_005944), both from the Hemiptera. MEGA (v. 4) ( Tamura et al., 2007 ) was used to both download and align the protein-coding (nucleotide) and ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Conveniently, MEGA can translate the protein-coding nucleotide sequences using the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code, align the resulting amino acid sequences using Clustal ( Chenna et al., 2003 ), then create a nucleotide sequence using the amino acid sequence as a guide. We used this approach to align all protein-coding genes. We are aware that some holometabolous insects may use a slight modification of the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code ( Abascal et al., 2006 ). However, examination of our alignments suggested no evidence of misalignment due to the putatively altered genetic code. The ClustalW settings for the protein-coding genes were as follows; pairwise alignment parameters: gap open penalty = 10, extension penalty = 0.1; multiple alignment parameters: gap open penalty = 10, extension penalty = 0.2; protein weight matrix = Gonnet; residue specific penalties = on; hydrophobic penalties = on; gap separation distance = 4; end gap separation = off; negative matrix = off; delay divergent cut-off = 30%. The ClustalW settings for the ribosomal RNA genes were; pairwise alignment parameters: gap opening penalty = 15, extension penalty = 6.66; the multiple alignment parameters were: gap opening penalty = 15, extension penalty = 6.66; DNA weight matrix = IUB; transition weight = 0.5; negative matrix = off; delay divergent cut-off = 30%. Nucleotide sequences for each of the alignments were then concatenated prior to phylogenetic analysis. 2.5 Measurement of genetic divergence of various Hymenoptera We used two measures to compare the degree of genetic divergence among various Hymenoptera. In the first, we calculated K a (the nonsynonymous substitution rate) and K s (the synonymous substitution rate). Both were calculated using the K a K s calculator (v. 1.2) ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). We used model averaging to calculate K a ( Posada and Buckley, 2004 ). In the second measure, we extracted branch length estimates from the most likely tree, after Bayesian analysis of the data. Branch lengths were conveniently displayed on this tree, using FigTree (v. 1). We then manually calculated the branch length for each taxon, from the tip to the ancestral node for the Hymenoptera. 2.6 Phylogenetic analyses Maximum parsimony analyses were conducted using PAUP (v. 4.0b10) ( Swofford, 2001 ). Gaps were coded as missing data. Heuristic searches for the most parsimonious trees were conducted with random addition of taxa, with the search repeated 100 times (nreps = 100). Bayesian analyses were conducted using MrBayes (v. 3.1.2) ( Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003 ). The model of analysis was chosen using MrModelTest ( Nylander, 2004 ), using the AIC criterion. For the vast majority of partitions, the GTR + G + I model (nst = 6, rates = invgamma) was chosen as the model that best fit the data, particularly for the partitions that were likely to be least saturated (1st codon, 2nd codon), and would thus be less prone to errors in estimation of the model. For consistency, we applied this model to all partitions. Partitioned analyses were conducted with each partition unlinked [unlink statefreq = (all); unlink revmat = (all); unlink shape = (all); unlink pinvar = (all); prset applyto = (all) ratepr = variable]. For each analysis, four chains (three heated, one cold) were run simultaneously for the Markov chain Monte Carlo process. Four independent runs of 2,000,000 generations were performed, with trees sampled every 100 generations. Each run started from a random tree. Convergence (or burnin: lack of improvement in likelihood scores) was assessed by examining the plot of generation against the likelihood scores. Convergence was then confirmed using the sump command in MrBayes. Trees sampled prior to convergence were discarded before construction of the majority consensus tree. The percentage of sampled trees recovering a particular clade was used as a measure of that clade’s posterior probability ( Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 ). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Genome organization The phylogenetic analysis of homologous genes that are in different mitochondrial positions may be problematic, given the different substitutional patterns that have been observed at different positions of the mitochondrial genome ( Reyes et al., 1998 ). Although we will report on the organization of the five new hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes elsewhere, the organization of the genes that we analyze here (protein-coding and ribosomal RNA) are not substantially different. In four of them, all protein-coding and rRNA genes are in identical positions [compared with the putative ancestral organization for the Holometabola ( Dowton et al., 2002 )]. In one of them ( Venturia ), there is a block inversion that encompasses three protein-coding genes. However, we include a close relative of Venturia ( Enicospilus , another member of the Ichneumonidae) that does not have this inversion, and the two were always recovered as sisters. Thus, we do not expect that gene rearrangement had an impact on our phylogenetic analyses. 3.2 Comparison of genetic divergence between hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes The Hymenoptera represent a challenging phylogeny to recover, particularly when using mitochondrial genes, due to the very different rates in their evolution among members. A previous study indicated a significant increase in the rate of genetic divergence of apocritan mitochondrial genes when compared with symphytan mitochondrial genes, and that symphytans were about as divergent as other Holometabola ( Dowton and Austin, 1995 ). However, this study was based on just two gene fragments (COI and 16S). Maximum likelihood differences were approximately 1.5 times higher for the Apocrita when compared with the basally divergent symphytan for the 16S gene, and about two times higher for COI amino acid sequences ( Dowton and Austin, 1995 ). In this study, we examined whether these trends were reproduced when complete mitochondrial sequences were compared. We measured K a and K s for each taxon investigated here, with calculations based on comparisons with the Drosophila mitochondrial genome ( Table 2 ). Although the choice of nonhymenopteran taxon might seem arbitrary, it should not bias the results, as it is the same for all hymenopteran taxa. Also, our phylogenetic analyses indicate that branch lengths among the Holometabola are remarkably uniform (except those for the Hymenoptera), such that any holometabolous taxon would make an appropriate comparison. These comparisons indicate that (i) K s is saturated, with levels ranging between 5 and 10 and (ii) K a is lowest (0.26) for the earliest diverging symphytan ( Perga ), and generally higher for the other Hymenoptera (range 0.40–0.52). These comparisons indicate that the trends observed earlier are found when the entire mitochondrial genome is analyzed. Nevertheless, we consider these comparisons preliminary. The best comparisons of relative divergences come from comparison of branch lengths in the phylogenetic trees. These were examined after phylogenetic analysis (see below), and confirm the trends observed here. 3.3 Phylogenetic analyses – comparison of methodological approaches We previously reported that a ‘test’ phylogeny of the Hymenoptera, one using taxa whose phylogenetic placements were known with relative certainty, was only recovered (i) when the analyses used nucleotide sequences (rather than amino acid sequences) and (ii) when the analyses employed a Bayesian approach (rather than maximum parsimony) ( Castro and Dowton, 2007 ). Outgroup composition was also found to be critical. The test phylogeny was only recovered when a broad range of holometabolous insects were used as outgroups. There was one exception to this trend. Bayesian analysis of nucelotide data, in which the third codon position was excluded, was able to recover the test phylogeny when only a single outgroup taxon was used. However, these findings may be influenced by the composition of the ingroup. The test phylogeny purposefully did not include taxa from a range of hymenopteran groups, because their positions are uncertain. Due to the broader sample of hymenopterans examined here, we reinvestigated the ability of various approaches to recover phylogeny. Indeed, we hoped that a larger sampling of ingroup taxa may relieve the necessity to broadly sample the outgroup. Although we do not know the phylogeny that should be recovered in this study, a subset of the relationships are well established. These uncontroversial relationships are, (i) the Aculeata should be monophyletic ( Rasnitsyn, 1980, 1988; Brothers and Carpenter, 1993; Sharkey, 2008 ), (ii) Cephus should be the second-most basally derived taxon (with Perga the most basal taxon) ( Rasnitsyn, 1988; Vilhelmsen, 1997, 2001; Schulmeister, 2003; Sharkey, 2008 ), (iii) Orussus should be sister to the Apocrita ( Rasnitsyn, 1980, 1988; Vilhelmsen, 2001; Schulmeister, 2003; Sharkey, 2008 ), and (iv) the two ichneumonids should be monophyletic ( Königsmann, 1978; Rasnitsyn, 1980, 1988; Sharkey and Wahl, 1992 ). The uncontroversial relationships used to assess the various phylogenetic approaches are listed in Table 3 . We performed phylogenetic analyses (i) using just the hymenopteran representatives, employing the earliest diverging hymenopteran included here ( Perga , based on the tree presented by Vilhelmsen, 2001 ) as the outgroup and (ii) using all representatives from the Holometabola for which complete mitochondrial genome data were available (on the 1st October, 2008, when analyses were started). In the latter case, two nonholometabolous insects (Hemiptera) were used as the outgroups ( Triatoma and Philaenus : order Hemiptera). The range of approaches attempted were (i) analysis of amino acid sequence data, (ii) analysis of nucleotide sequence data from all protein-coding genes (including all codon positions) and rRNA genes, and (iii) analysis of first and second codon positions from the protein-coding genes, together with rRNA genes. We performed each of these analyses employing both maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis. For the latter, we partitioned the data into 1st codon, 2nd codon, 3rd codon, and rRNA (i.e. 12S and 16S combined) and analyzed them unlinked. We investigated variations on this partitioning strategy later in the study. The results of the analyses when the earliest diverging hymenopteran ( Perga ) was used as the ougroup are listed in Table 4 . None of the approaches recovered all of the uncontroversial relationships. Amino acid sequence data generally recovered more of the uncontroversial relationships than other approaches, but only within the Apocrita. None of the approaches were able to place Primeuchroeus appropriately. This was always recovered with the outgroup, and consequently not with the other Aculeata ( Table 4 ). Both of the included symphytans ( Cephus and Orussus ) were always misplaced. Similarly, when a range of Holometabola were included, most analyses were still unable to recover all relationships ( Table 5 ), although many of the analyses recovered more of the uncontroversial relationships. A Bayesian approach, including 3rd codon positions, recovered all but one of the uncontroversial relationships, the sister grouping of Vanhornia and Nasonia . This was the least frequently recovered relationship among these analyses. The expected placement of Primeuchroeus , sister to the remaining aculeates, was generally improved with the inclusion of a broad set of outgroup taxa. The impact of multiple outgroups is most apparent when analyses that excluded the 3rd codon position are compared. For MP analyses, just three of the seven uncontroversial relationships are recovered when Perga is used as the ougroup, while five are recovered when the broader outgroups are used. For the Bayesian analysis, the improvement is greater, with just three relationships recovered when Perga is the outroup, but all are recovered with multiple outgroups. Many of these trends are similar to those obtained after simulation studies ( Hall, 2005 ). 3.4 Phylogenetic analyses – comparison of partitioning approaches Given that partitioned Bayesian analyses appeared able to recover a number of uncontroversial relationships across the range of divergences within the Hymenoptera, we next examined the impact of various partitioning strategies (including an absence of partitioning). Partitioning the data facilitates the optimization of the likelihood among sites that are putatively evolving under similar evolutionary conditions. In order to compare partitioning strategies, we used Bayes factors. In this approach, Bayes factors are the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of two alternate hypotheses. The Bayes factor is calculated by multiplying the difference between the natural logarithms of the two harmonic means by two. If this number is greater than 10, it is taken as strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis with the higher likelihood score. The range of partitioning strategies used here are outlined in Table 6 . We employed an incremental approach to partitioning (from very simple to highly partitioned), in order to examine the influence of each element of the partitioning approach to the analysis. Examination of the trees recovered from these analyses indicated that each analysis produced identical topologies, with respect to hymenopteran relationships. In each case, all seven uncontroversial relationships were recovered. The likelihood was significantly improved with each increase in the number of data partitions ( Table 7 ), as has been observed by others ( Mueller et al., 2004; Brandley et al., 2005; Castoe and Parkinson, 2006 ). The impact of each incremental increase in the number of partitions can be seen by comparing the Bayes factors along the diagonal of Table 7 . These are the numbers that compare P1 with P2, P2 with P3, and so on. This reveals that the smallest improvement was seen with partitioning the ribosomal genes separately (compare P2 with P3 in Table 7 ), producing a Bayes factor of 84. The greatest improvement was seen when an unpartitioned strategy (P1) was compared with a minimally partitioned strategy (P2: 1st codon, 2nd codon, rRNA genes), producing a Bayes factor of 6430. In any case, all partitioning strategies were judged to significantly improve the likelihood score. Others have noted that this metric appears lenient ( Brown and Lemmon, 2007 ); a Bayes factor of only 10 is all that is needed to accept one partitioned strategy over another, yet we and others ( Mueller et al., 2004; Brandley et al., 2005; Castoe and Parkinson, 2006 ) regularly observe Bayses factors higher than 1000. But this does not seem to be the case: a Bayes factor cutoff of 10 did not lead to a high false positive rate (i.e. accepting overly partitioned analyses), when both simulated and real datasets were analyzed ( Brown and Lemmon, 2007 ). Indeed, Bayes factors behaved remarkably well, giving a false positive rate of 5% ( Brown and Lemmon, 2007 ). On a practical note, convergence took considerably longer with the heavily partitioned analyses, as previously reported for orthopteran mitochondrial genomes ( Fenn et al., 2008 ). For example, convergence was judged to have occurred after just 5000 generations with the P1–P4 analyses (which had between 1 and 5 partitions), but not until 500,000 generations with the P5 analysis (28 partitions). 3.5 Phylogeny of the Hymenoptera based on mitochondrial genome sequences For the reasons outlined above, we present the tree produced from the analysis that gave the highest likelihood score, i.e. from the P5 analysis ( Fig. 1 ). Each of the included holometabolous orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera) were recovered as monophyletic, with BPPs (Baysian posterior probability) of 1.00. The Hymenoptera were recovered as the sister group to the Lepidoptera + Diptera, but with a BPP of only 0.80. We consider that the taxon sampling of the other holometabolous orders is too depauperate to adequately investigate holometabolous relationships, particularly as the sister group varies under different analytical schemes ( Castro and Dowton, 2005; Cameron et al., 2008 ). Rather, we restrict our observations to those among the Hymenoptera, for which the analytical approach was optimized. This tree ( Fig. 2 ) indicates that the Apocrita have a much accelerated rate of genetic divergence (compared with the basally diverging symphytans – here represented by Perga and Cephus ) in the entire mitochondrial genome, as was reported previously for two mitochondrial gene fragments ( Dowton and Austin, 1995 ). Branch lengths for each exemplar (calculated for each taxon, from the tip to the ancestral node for the Hymenoptera) appear in Table 2 . We consider that the tree-based estimate is the best indication of the degree of genetic divergence, as it is based on the model that best fits each of the data partitions. The tree-based estimate suggests that the Apocrita generally have two to three times the genetic divergence of Perga . This is almost double the rate differential compared with that calculated using K a . This confirms our suspicion that K a is not adequately accounting for hidden change. Indeed, the largest K a values (and longest branch lengths) are for the aculeate taxa, and this is the group most heavily sampled. The higher taxon sampling is likely to result in better genetic divergence estimates, for both K a and Bayesian branch length approaches. Excluding the uncontroversial relationships, examination of the trees recovered under each of the partitioning strategies indicates that they are identical, perhaps an indication that we have reached the limit of resolution with this particular dataset. The Ichneumonidae are always recovered as the sister group to the stephanid. Although the BPP for this relationship is low for the unpartitioned analysis (P1) at 0.71, it is generally high for all of the partitioned analyses (range 0.94–0.98). This relationship is contrary to that resolved by our most recent taxon-rich, multigene analysis ( Castro and Dowton, 2006 ), in which the stephanids were recovered closer to the Aculeata than to the Ichneumonidae. Although the level of support for this latter relationship was lower in the taxon-rich analysis (BPP = 0.88), we consider this a better estimate of phylogenetic relationships among the Hymenoptera, due to the higher level of taxonomic sampling. With respect to the only other controversial relationship examined here, the proctotrupomorphs were more variably recovered as sister to the ichneumonids plus stephanid. The BPP for this relationship was lower, at 0.79, for the analysis shown in Fig. 1 , but was generally low across the partitioned strategies (range 0.57–0.79). The reason for this was that the post burnin trees included ones with other relationships. In some of the post burnin trees, the Aculeata were recovered with the ichneumonids and the stephanid (BPP = 0.15), while in others, just the ichneumonids and Aculeata were recovered (BPP = 0.06). We consider these relationships as tentative only – the primary goal of this investigation was to establish analytical approaches for the analysis of mitochondrial genome data, when branch lengths differ substantially among groups. We consider that the analytical approach adopted here achieves that aim. Pleasingly, the approach supported by our study (partitioned Bayesian analysis of nucleotide data, excluding 3rd codon positions) shares a number of similarities with those proposed for other groups, ones that do not have such disparate rates of genetic divergence. For example, analysis of dipteran mitochondrial genomes indicated that relationships were robust to the analytical approach, with parsimony and Bayesian analyses recovering identical ingroup topologies ( Cameron et al., 2007 ). In this study, partitioned Bayesian analyses outperformed other approaches, although the inclusion of 3rd codon positions was found to provide additional phylogenetic signal ( Cameron et al., 2007 ). Similarly, analysis of orthopteran mitochondrial genomes suggested that partitioned Bayesian analysis of all nucleotide data (including 3rd codon positions) outperformed both maximum parsimony and unpartitioned Bayesian analyses ( Fenn et al., 2008 ). However, exclusion of 3rd codon positions had no effect on topology, in either the orthopteran or dipteran study. Taken together, these findings suggest that a single analytical approach may be feasible for the mitochondrial genomes of holometabolous and related insects, one involving partitioned Bayesian analysis with the exclusion of 3rd codon positions. Establishing this will ultimately rest on the generation of mitochondrial genome sequence data from the remaining holometabolous (i.e. outside of the Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera) insect orders.
