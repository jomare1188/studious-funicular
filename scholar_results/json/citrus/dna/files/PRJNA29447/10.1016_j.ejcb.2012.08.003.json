    "full_text": "The cytoskeleton is crucial in determining cell architecture, division, motility, transport processes and in local control of signal transduction. Relatives of actin and tubulin are expressed in all phyla, underlining the fundamental importance of conserved cytoskeletal functions. Intermediate filament proteins have evolved in parallel with tissue diversity in the animal kingdom, likely from the demand to adapt one class of cytoskeletal proteins to cell type-restricted functions. Up to now, the evolutionary origin of cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins remains unknown. Using a known gene encoding a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein from the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii , we have identified the first corresponding gene in the sea anemone Nematostella , tentatively named cytovec. Our data reveal a relationship of cytovec with Hydra vulgaris nematocilins A and B that also lack a CAAX box. In light of additional recent findings, our data show that cytoplasmic intermediate filament genes are present in the common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria."

          "The cytoskeleton is crucial in determining cell architecture, division, motility transport processes and in local control of signal transduction. Whereas relatives of actin and tubulin are expressed in all phyla intermediate filament proteins have evolved in parallel with tissue diversity in the animal kingdom, likely from the demand to adapt one class of cytoskeletal proteins to cell type-restricted functions ( Fuchs and Weber, 1994; Wickstead and Gull, 2011 ). The multigene family of metazoan intermediate filament proteins covers two groups: the nuclear lamins and the cytoplasmic intermediate filament (IF) proteins. Their sequence homologies are particularly obvious in the protostomic IF proteins, because the central coiled coil domains have the same length as the lamins, while in deuterostomic species the central domain of IF proteins is shortened ( Dodemont et al., 1990; Doring and Stick, 1990 ).",
          "A major difference between lamins and IF proteins concerns two features of the lamins: a nuclear localization signal, usually 4 consecutive basic residues in the carboxy-terminal tail domain, and the C-terminal isoprenylation site C-a-a M, which in a stepwise reaction gives rise to chargeless carboxy terminal cysteine ( Gruenbaum et al., 2005 ).",
          "RNA interference studies under standard conditions showed that at least 5 of the IF proteins of the nematode C. elegans are essential in the earliest stages of embryonic development ( Karabinos et al., 2001 ). The family of mammalian cytoplasmic IF proteins is much larger ( Hesse et al., 2001 ) and its expression patterns has been reviewed ( Iwatsuki and Suda, 2010; Windoffer et al., 2011 ). In accordance with the large number of mammalian IF genes, at least 25 human IF genes show mutations which give rise or contribute to diseases ( Bonifas et al., 1991; Vassar et al., 1991; Szeverenyi et al., 2008 ; http://www.interfil.org/index.php ). While type III proteins like desmin form in vivo and in vitro homopolymeric IF, the epithelial keratins are obligatory heteropolymers based on dimers containing a type I and a type II keratin. The type IV neurofilament proteins can have larger molecular weights due to unique extensions of the C-terminal tail domains.",
          "Metazoa cover the more basal phyla of the radiata, which have radial symmetry and the large group of bilateral animals, which have bilateral symmetry ( Wehner and Gehring, 2007 ). When genomic information became available for the first representative of the radiata, we screened the developing genome of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis for representatives of lamin and IF genes. Although we found a lamin gene, we and others failed to detect IF genes ( Zimek and Weber, 2008 ). This was unexpected, since previous electron microscopical studies documented a wealth of cytoplasmic IF in the radiata (see for instance Bartnik and Weber (1989) ). Here we repeated the screen using however as probe a gene from metazoa closer related to radiata than the mammalian genes, which were earlier used. In our work, we identified the cytoplasmic protein cytovec, a putative IF-forming protein with the highest degree of similarity to the cytosolic IF protein from Clytia hemispherica and from nematocilin A and B from Hydra vulgaris ( Hwang et al., 2008 )."

              "Using the previously described IF gene from the hemichordate S. kowalevskii ( Zimek and Weber, 2002 ) as a probe on the genome information of Nematostella , we located a potential IF gene on scaffold 94 (nt. 50739–65390). The deduced protein sequence is shown in Fig. 1 , which also gives the position of the 12 introns from the 5′-end. Intron sizes are 800 bp, 285 bp, 930 bp, 380 bp, 1554 bp, 110 bp, 5716 bp, 322 bp, 697 bp, 211 bp, 957 bp and 435 bp. Position of introns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 are conserved with those in Nematostella lamin ( Zimek and Weber, 2008 ). Cytovec shares 19.7% identical amino acids with the previously described lamin gene of Nematostella , and ∼23.5% with the cytoplasmic nematocilins of H. vulgaris ( Fig. 1 ). The highest degree of sequence identity is found at the rod end domains and in the middle of coil 1B. The IF consensus sequence YRKLLEGEE at the rod end is well conserved except that the Tyr residue is replaced by a Phe in cytovec. The Nematostella cytovec gene is clearly not a second lamin gene, since it lacks the nuclear localization signal and the C-a-a-M motive indicated for the lamin genes. However, it contains a recognizable immunoglobulin-like domain although structure prediction algorithms predict an arrangement distinctly different from that of Nematostella lamin ( Fig. 2 ). Whereas the nuclear localization signal in bilateral metazoa involves 4 consecutive basic residues, the lamins from the two species of the radiata currently known show only 3 basic residues in the sequences KRSR ( Hydra ) and KRAR ( Nematostella ) ( Zimek and Weber, 2011 ). The deduced protein sequence of 760 amino acids corresponds to a size of 85.4 kDa and shows a length like in protostomic metazoa ( Zimek and Weber, 2008 ). The sizeable number of Nematostella EST sequences covering the entire open reading frame support its expression. Table 1 lists the amino acid distribution in the two known Nematostella proteins. Across the rod domain, Nematostella lamin has a much higher ratio of acidic/basic (42.9%) residues compared to cytovec (34.2%). Another distinguishing feature is the prevalence of Ser/Thr residues in the lamin head domain. The overall amino acid distribution differs strongly from that of human keratins ( Strnad et al., 2012 )."

              "Fig. 3 reveals a distinct relationship between the 2 Nematostella IF proteins, the recently described isomin ( I. maculatus ; Mencarelli et al., 2011 ) and cytoplasmic IF proteins from C. elegans . The relationship among the Nematostella IF sequences (∼19.6%) is closer than to C. elegans proteins (∼9.9–14% identity) with well conserved rod motifs at the start of coil 1A and the end of coil 2B. Isomin is very distantly related to cytovec and shares ∼7.7% identical amino acids. To further examine the relationship between cytovec, cytoplasmic and nuclear IF proteins, additional comparisons were performed. Figs. 4–6 provide data on cytovec's relationship with selected IF sequences. The limited EST sequences from the anthozoan A. digitifera and the hydrozoan Clytia hemispherica reveal 44.8% sequence identity between the entire Clytia protein and the first 627 amino acids of cytovec ( Fig. 4 ). The C-terminal extension of 135 residues in the latter have no counterpart in the Acropora and Clytia sequences. With regard to other IF proteins, the extent of sequence identity is low (between 9% and 11.8%). The rod end domains, in particular the end of coil 2B, are well conserved, supporting the classification of cytovec as cytoplasmic IF protein. Because of the closeness of these values it is currently impossible to decide which mammalian IF protein is the obvious counterpart of Nematostella IF cytovec. Attempts to get information via flanking genes as previously done for lamin genes ( Zimek and Weber, 2011 ) were not possible because of the gaps in the genome of Nematostella . We note however that in the primitive bilateral animal, the nematode C. elegans , there is firm in vivo and in vitro evidence for a keratin-like obligatory heteropolymer system, but no indication for an additional homopolymer system ( Karabinos et al., 2003 ). The phylogenetic tree analysis ( Fig. 7 ) supports a relatively close relationship between cytovec, the cytoplasmic IF proteins of the anthozoan A. digitifera , the hydrozoans Clytia hemispherica , H. vulgaris , S. purpuratus , S. kowalevskii and C. intestinalis . It further confirms the grouping of Nematostella lamin with other lamins. These two groups are distantly related from other cytoplasmic IF proteins and from isomin."

The organization of the nematocilins in a central filament of the cnidocil of H. vulgaris where they are surrounded by microtubules suggest an architectural role of IF early in evolution ( Hwang et al., 2008 ). Whether cytovec forms typical IF remains to be analyzed. Possibly, expression of a cytovec cDNA in E. coli may help to address its filament-forming capacity.

Results Identification of a cytoplasmic nematostella IF protein Using the previously described IF gene from the hemichordate S. kowalevskii ( Zimek and Weber, 2002 ) as a probe on the genome information of Nematostella , we located a potential IF gene on scaffold 94 (nt. 50739–65390). The deduced protein sequence is shown in Fig. 1 , which also gives the position of the 12 introns from the 5′-end. Intron sizes are 800 bp, 285 bp, 930 bp, 380 bp, 1554 bp, 110 bp, 5716 bp, 322 bp, 697 bp, 211 bp, 957 bp and 435 bp.
