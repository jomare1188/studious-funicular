    "full_text": "Percomorpha has been described as the “(unresolved) bush at the top” of the teleostean phylogenies and its intrarelationships are intrinsically difficult to solve because of its huge diversity (>15,000 spp.) and ill-defined higher taxa. Patterns of facial nerves, such as those of the ramus lateralis accessorius (RLA), have been considered as one of the candidate characters to delimit a monophyletic group within the percomorphs. Six families of the suborder Percoidei (Arripidae, Dichistiidae, Kyphosidae, Terapontidae, Kuhliidae, and Oplegnathidae) and suborder Stromateoidei (including six families) share the unique pattern 10 of RLA and it has been suggested that those fishes form a monophyletic group across the two perciform suborders. To evaluate the usefulness of the RLA pattern 10 as a phylogenetic marker within the percomorphs, we newly determined whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences for the 13 species having RLA pattern 10 and their putatively, closely-related species (5 spp.). Unambiguously aligned sequences (14,263 bp) from those 18 species plus 50 percomrphs and two outgroups (total 70 species) were subjected to partitioned maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. The resulting trees clearly indicated that there were at least two independent origins of the unique facial nerve pattern: one in a common ancestor of Kyphosidae, Terapontidae, Kuhliidae, and Oplegnathidae and another one in that of the percoid Arripidae and Stromateoidei. Thus further detailed anatomical studies are needed to clarify the homology of this character between the two lineages. It should be noted that the latter two taxa (Arripidae and Stromateoidei) formed an unexpected, highly-supported monophyletic group together with Scombridae and possibly Chiasmodontidae and Bramidae, all lacking RLA pattern 10 (the former two are members of other perciform suborders Scombroidei and Trachinoidei, respectively). This novel, trans-subordinal clade has never been suggested by any morphological studies, although they share a common ecological characteristic, dwelling in the pelagic realm and often associated with long-distance migrations."

          "Percomorpha (sensu Miya et al., 2003, 2005 ) occupies the top of the higher teleostean phylogenies, comprising some 15,322 species placed in 13 orders, 269 families, and 2537 genera (calculated from Nelson, 2006 ). The group was first recognized in a cladistic framework by Rosen (1973) , who treated it as the most derived clade in his euteleostean phylogeny without mentioning evidence for its monophyly. Since Rosen (1973) , numerous comparative anatomical studies have been conducted in attempts to delimit monophyletic groups within the percomorphs and to resolve their inter- and intrarelationships using cladistic methodology (for recent reviews, see Johnson, 1993; Stiassny et al., 2004 ). The comparative anatomical approaches, however, have faced a number of difficulties, such as the lack of applicable characters and homology assessment among characters if any ( Johnson and Patterson, 1993 ). One of the exceptions to this was the recognition of Smegmamorpha (synbranchids + mastacembelids + elassomatids + gasterosteiforms + mugilids + atherinomorphs), which was based on a single specialization, a unique attachment of the first epineural at the tip of a prominent transverse process on the first vertebra ( Johnson and Patterson, 1993 ; but see Springer and Johnson, 2004 for a slightly different view). The group as a whole, however, has gained no support from subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies ( Chen et al., 2003; Dettai and Lecointre, 2005; Kawahara et al., 2008; Mabuchi et al., 2007; Miya et al., 2001, 2003, 2005; Setiamarga et al., 2008; Smith and Craig, 2007; Wiley et al., 2000 ).",
          "The patterns of nerves, such as the ramus lateralis accessorius (RLA) of the facial nerve, have attracted attention as an additional source of characters that can be used to diagnose monophyletic subgroups of the percomorphs ( Freihofer, 1963; Helfman et al., 1997 ). Actually Freihofer (1963) observed that, while RLA patterns 8 and 9 ( Fig. 1 A) were common in the order Perciformes, pattern 10 ( Fig. 1 B) was uniquely shared by the following percoid families (Pomatomidae, Arripidae, Kyphosidae, Terapontidae, Kuhliidae, and Nematistiidae) and two families of the suborder Stromateoidei (Stromateidae and Nomeidae). Subsequently the remaining four families of Stromateoidei, percoid Oplegnathidae ( Johnson and Fritzsche, 1989 ) and Dichistiidae ( Leis and van der Lingen, 1997 ) have been added to the group, while Pomatomidae and Nematistiidae ( Johnson and Fritzsche, 1989 ) have been deleted from the original listing of Freihofer (1963) . Recently Yagishita et al. (2002) compared the partial sequences from the mitochondrial ND2 gene from fishes having RLA pattern 10 and evaluated the monophyly of the Kyphosidae (sensu Nelson, 1994 ). Yagishita et al. (2002) suggested that the group characterized by RLA pattern 10 formed a monophyletic group, although their taxonomic sampling was far from satisfactory to address this question, because they included only one perciform family (Serranidae) as a taxon without RLA pattern 10. Since then no molecular phylogenetic study has been conducted that purposefully sample those taxa having RLA pattern 10 from the percomorphs.",
          "Recently a mitochondrial phylogenomic approach has been employed to address questions regarding the percomorph phylogenies. For instance Mabuchi et al. (2007) resolved a long-standing problem of the suborder Labroidei, convincingly demonstrating that labrids and cichlids (+ embiotocids and pomacentrids) have diverged basally within the percomorphs. Yamanoue et al. (2007) investigated phylogenetic position of the order Tetraodontiformes within the percomorphs and found that either Lophiiformes plus Caproidei or Caproidei alone were sister-groups of the group. Subsequently Kawahara et al. (2008) investigated relationships of the 11 gasterosteiform families and found that the order was polyphyletic, comprising three lineages (Gasterosteoidei, Syngnathoidei, and Indostomidae) that have diverged basally within the percomorphs. Recently Setiamarga et al. (2008) corroborated monophyly of the series Atherinomoprha and found that the group was deeply nested in a highly supported, more comprehensive clade, all of which spawn demersal eggs with filaments. Interestingly these studies, together with earlier studies by Miya et al. (2003, 2005) , have consistently reproduced eight unnested clades within the percomorphs ( Fig. 2 ), although none of them have used fishes having RLA pattern 10.",
          "To evaluate the usefulness of RLA pattern 10 as a phylogenetic marker within the percomorphs, we newly determined whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences for the 13 species having RLA pattern 10 and their putatively, closely-related species (5 spp.). Unambiguously aligned sequences (14,263 bp) from those 18 species plus 50 percomrphs and two outgroups (total 70 species) were subjected to partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) analyses. The resulting trees not only indicated multiple origins of RLA pattern 10, but also revealed a highly supported, unexpected clade that solely comprises pelagic species placed in three (or possibly four) different perciform suborders (Percoidei, Stromateoidei, Scombroidei, and Trachinoidei)."

              "To address the origin of RLA pattern 10, we used 13 species having RLA pattern 10: three species from two stromateoid families (Centrolophidae and Nomeidae) plus 10 species from five percoid families (Arripidae, Kyphosidae, Terapontidae Kuhliidae, and Oplegnathidae). We also used 27 species from 10 percoid families and tetraodontiforms that have been hypothesized to be closely related to the members having RLA pattern 10, viz. Monodactylidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Ephippididae ( Gosline, 1985; Mok and Shen, 1983 ), Toxotidae, Enoplosidae, Pentacerotidae, Siganidae, Zanclidae, Acanthuridae, and Tetraodontiformes ( Mok and Shen, 1983 ). In addition, our analyses included whole mitogenome sequences from 28 percomorph species (sensu Miya et al., 2003, 2005 ). We did not use those percomorph species found in Clades A and B in Fig. 2 , because none of them have been assumed to be related to the members having RLA pattern 10 based on both morphological ( Gosline, 1985; Mok and Shen, 1983 ) and molecular ( Kawahara et al., 2008; Mabuchi et al., 2007; Miya et al., 2003, 2005; Setiamarga et al., 2008; Yamanoue et al., 2007 ) studies. As collective outgroups to root the trees, Polymixia japonica (Polymixiidae) and Beryx splendens (Berycidae) were selected with reference to Miya et al. (2003, 2005) .

The mitogenomes were amplified in their entirety using a long PCR technique ( Cheng et al., 1994 ). We used seven fish-versatile long PCR primers in the following five combinations: S-LA-16S-L + S-LA-16S-H; L2508-16S + H1065-12S; L2508-16S + H15149-CYB; L2508-16S + H12293-Leu; L12321-Leu + S-LA-16S-H (for locations and sequences of these primers, see Inoue et al., 2000, 2001; Ishiguro et al., 2001; Kawaguchi et al., 2001; Miya and Nishida, 2000 ) to amplify the entire mitogenome in two reactions. Long PCR reaction conditions followed Miya and Nishida (1999) . Long PCR products diluted with TE buffer (1:19) were subsequently used as templates for short PCR reactions employing fish-versatile PCR primers in various combinations to amplify contiguous, overlapping segments of the entire mitogenome. The short PCR reactions were carried out following protocols previously described ( Miya and Nishida, 1999 ), then purified using ExoSap-IT enzyme (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.), and subsequently sequenced with dye-labeled terminators (BigDye terminator ver. 3.1, Applied Biosystems) and the primers used in the short PCRs. Sequencing reactions were conducted following the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by electrophoresis on an ABI Prism 3100 or 3130 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A list of PCR primers used in this study is available from N.Y. upon request."

This matrix was constructed by first replacing the third codon purines (A/G) with “R”, and the third codon pyrimidines (C/T) with “Y” ( Phillips and Penny, 2003; Phillips et al., 2004 ). The data matrices were then subjected to partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) analyses. Five (for 123 n RT n and 12 n 3 r RT n ) and four (for 12 n RT n ) partitions were set for each analysis.",

For each dataset, a rapid bootstrap analysis and search for the best-scoring ML tree were conducted in one single program run, with the GTR + I + Γ nucleotide substitution model ( Yang, 1994 ). The rapid bootstrap analyses were conducted with 100 replications, with four threads running in parallel. The program finally conducted ML optimization for every 5th bootstrapped tree to search for the best-scoring ML tree.",

The GTR + I + Γ model was used for nucleotide substitution model. We assumed that all of the model parameters were unlinked, that the rate multipliers were variable across partitions, and used the default settings for the priors on the proportion of invariable sites (0–1) and gamma shape parameters (0.1–50.0). A Dirichlet distribution was assumed for the rate matrix and base frequencies, and every tree topology was assumed equally probable. For third codon positions in 12 n 3 r RT n coding, we used arbitrarily “A” and “C” instead of “R” and “Y” respectively, and set a single rate category for this partition (lset nst = 1) instead of six to avoid unnecessary estimation of transitional changes during the calculations.",

(2006) performed detailed analyses of phylogenetic performance for the five partitions as used in this study and demonstrated that inclusion of the third codon position transitions (3 n ) led to erroneous estimations of phylogenies for the basal relationships of the cypriniforms. Following their suggestion, we considered that the results from the 12 n 3 r RT n dataset (RY-coding) represented the best estimate of phylogenies at this taxonomic level (within the percomorphs), which effectively removing likely noise from quickly saturated transitional changes in third codon positions and avoiding a lack of signal by retaining all available positions in the dataset. Accordingly, the resultant tree from the 12 n 3 r RT n data derived from the partitioned ML analysis (ln L = −234,460.757) is shown in Figs. 3 (cladogram) and 4 (phylogram), with statistical support [bootstrap probabilities (BPs) from the partitioned ML analysis and posterior probabilities (PPs) from the partitioned BA analysis] indicated on each internal branch. Topological differences between the results from the two analyses (partitioned ML and BA analyses) were minor and found only in the placement of Scomber scombrus (Scombridae), Kuhlia mugil (Kuhliidae) and Pomacanthidae (denoted by arrowheads in Fig. 3 ).",

However, in none of the analyses was the group having RLA pattern 10 recovered as monophyletic within the Percomorpha ( Fig. 3 ). Statistical comparisons using the likelihood-based SH test confidently rejected monophyly of the group having RLA pattern 10 (Δln L = –1102.9; p < 0.001). Leis and van der Lingen (1997) suggested the subgroup of the families having RLA pattern 10 which excludes Oplegnathidae and Stromateoidei to be monophyletic, based on similarities of larval characters, such as body form, opercular series spination, fin development and, most notably, distinctive pigmentation patterns. Oplegnathidae, however, was deeply nested in a highly supported clade within Clade H (Clade h2: BP/PP = 100%) comprising those percoids having RLA pattern 10. Stromateoidei, on the other hand, formed a highly-supported monophyletic group (Clade F: BP/PP = 100%) together with Arripidae (with RLA pattern 10) and Scombridae (without RLA pattern 10). Although we could not resolve interrelationships among Arripidae, Stromateoidei and Scombridae definitely, most parsimonious reconstruction of RLA pattern 10 on the present tree suggested that there are at least two independent origins of RLA pattern 10 in the percomorphs (common ancestors of Clade h2 and Stromateoidei + Arripidae, subsequently lost in Scombridae with the exception of Scomber for the latter clade). The homology reassessment of the facial nerve patterns between these two lineages is necessary for more correct understanding of the morphological similarities. Scombridae was presented as a non-monophyletic group in the present tree and future dense taxonomic sampling from the other scombroids together with other members of Clade F would clarify the issue."

              "One of the most unexpected findings in this study was that members of the Arripidae (Percoidei), Stromateoidei, and Scombridae (Scombroidei) formed a well-supported monophyletic group (Clade F; Fig. 3 ) in both ML and BA (BP/PP = 100%) analyses. The three percomorph taxa have been consistently placed in different suborders and no previous morphological studies have suggested such close relationships. Molecular studies, however, have repeatedly implied such relationships. Yagishita et al. (2002) , for example, analyzed mitochondrial ND2 gene sequences (678 bp) from 20 percomorphs with RLA pattern 10 and found that members of Arripidae and Stromateoidei formed a monophyletic group in the resulting trees, although the support values were relatively low (50–63% BPs and 59% quartet puzzling). Chen et al. (2003) conducted extensive taxonomic sampling from acanthomorphs (72 species), analyzed relatively long sequences from the combined mitochondrial and nuclear genes (2420 bp in total), and found that a scombrid, two stromateoids, and a trachinoid genus Kali (Chiasmodontidae: without RLA pattern 10) formed a monophyletic group with a high BP (97%). Subsequently Dettai and Lecointre (2005, 2008) recovered this monophyletic group with the same species based on different nuclear loci. Recently, Li et al. (2009) analyzed different nuclear marker, and demonstrated that a percoid genus Pterycombus (Bramidae: without RLA pattern 10) was included in the monophyletic group. It is therefore likely that members from (at least) four different perciform suborders (Percoidei, Stromateoidei, Scombroidei, and Trachinoidei) form a monophyletic group.",
              "It should be noted that the fishes included in this monophyletic group (Clade F in this study and Clade H in Chen et al., 2003; Dettai and Lecointre, 2005, 2008; Li et al., 2009 ) are morphologically diverse, but they are all dwellers of pelagic realm and often associated with long-distance migrations: scombrids are commonly pelagic and some species perform transoceanic migrations ( Collette, 2001 ); stromateoids are generally pelagic, actively swimming along continental slopes and shelves ( Helfman et al., 1997; McDowall, 2001 ); although arripids are nearshore pelagic fishes, they migrate long distances ( Ayvazian et al., 2004; Kuiter, 1993 ); chiasmodontids are also pelagic, but they may be lethargic because they are found in meso- and bathypelagic depths (200–2000 m; Mooi and Paxton, 2001 ); bramids are mostly true pelagic fishes ( Smith, 1986 ). Future addition of pelagic species from the percomorphs with unknown identity would further expand the limits of this distinct, previously unrecognized clade."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Percomorpha (sensu Miya et al., 2003, 2005 ) occupies the top of the higher teleostean phylogenies, comprising some 15,322 species placed in 13 orders, 269 families, and 2537 genera (calculated from Nelson, 2006 ). The group was first recognized in a cladistic framework by Rosen (1973) , who treated it as the most derived clade in his euteleostean phylogeny without mentioning evidence for its monophyly. Since Rosen (1973) , numerous comparative anatomical studies have been conducted in attempts to delimit monophyletic groups within the percomorphs and to resolve their inter- and intrarelationships using cladistic methodology (for recent reviews, see Johnson, 1993; Stiassny et al., 2004 ). The comparative anatomical approaches, however, have faced a number of difficulties, such as the lack of applicable characters and homology assessment among characters if any ( Johnson and Patterson, 1993 ). One of the exceptions to this was the recognition of Smegmamorpha (synbranchids + mastacembelids + elassomatids + gasterosteiforms + mugilids + atherinomorphs), which was based on a single specialization, a unique attachment of the first epineural at the tip of a prominent transverse process on the first vertebra ( Johnson and Patterson, 1993 ; but see Springer and Johnson, 2004 for a slightly different view). The group as a whole, however, has gained no support from subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies ( Chen et al., 2003; Dettai and Lecointre, 2005; Kawahara et al., 2008; Mabuchi et al., 2007; Miya et al., 2001, 2003, 2005; Setiamarga et al., 2008; Smith and Craig, 2007; Wiley et al., 2000 ). The patterns of nerves, such as the ramus lateralis accessorius (RLA) of the facial nerve, have attracted attention as an additional source of characters that can be used to diagnose monophyletic subgroups of the percomorphs ( Freihofer, 1963; Helfman et al., 1997 ). Actually Freihofer (1963) observed that, while RLA patterns 8 and 9 ( Fig. 1 A) were common in the order Perciformes, pattern 10 ( Fig. 1 B) was uniquely shared by the following percoid families (Pomatomidae, Arripidae, Kyphosidae, Terapontidae, Kuhliidae, and Nematistiidae) and two families of the suborder Stromateoidei (Stromateidae and Nomeidae). Subsequently the remaining four families of Stromateoidei, percoid Oplegnathidae ( Johnson and Fritzsche, 1989 ) and Dichistiidae ( Leis and van der Lingen, 1997 ) have been added to the group, while Pomatomidae and Nematistiidae ( Johnson and Fritzsche, 1989 ) have been deleted from the original listing of Freihofer (1963) . Recently Yagishita et al. (2002) compared the partial sequences from the mitochondrial ND2 gene from fishes having RLA pattern 10 and evaluated the monophyly of the Kyphosidae (sensu Nelson, 1994 ). Yagishita et al. (2002) suggested that the group characterized by RLA pattern 10 formed a monophyletic group, although their taxonomic sampling was far from satisfactory to address this question, because they included only one perciform family (Serranidae) as a taxon without RLA pattern 10. Since then no molecular phylogenetic study has been conducted that purposefully sample those taxa having RLA pattern 10 from the percomorphs. Recently a mitochondrial phylogenomic approach has been employed to address questions regarding the percomorph phylogenies. For instance Mabuchi et al. (2007) resolved a long-standing problem of the suborder Labroidei, convincingly demonstrating that labrids and cichlids (+ embiotocids and pomacentrids) have diverged basally within the percomorphs. Yamanoue et al. (2007) investigated phylogenetic position of the order Tetraodontiformes within the percomorphs and found that either Lophiiformes plus Caproidei or Caproidei alone were sister-groups of the group. Subsequently Kawahara et al. (2008) investigated relationships of the 11 gasterosteiform families and found that the order was polyphyletic, comprising three lineages (Gasterosteoidei, Syngnathoidei, and Indostomidae) that have diverged basally within the percomorphs. Recently Setiamarga et al. (2008) corroborated monophyly of the series Atherinomoprha and found that the group was deeply nested in a highly supported, more comprehensive clade, all of which spawn demersal eggs with filaments. Interestingly these studies, together with earlier studies by Miya et al. (2003, 2005) , have consistently reproduced eight unnested clades within the percomorphs ( Fig. 2 ), although none of them have used fishes having RLA pattern 10. To evaluate the usefulness of RLA pattern 10 as a phylogenetic marker within the percomorphs, we newly determined whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences for the 13 species having RLA pattern 10 and their putatively, closely-related species (5 spp.). Unambiguously aligned sequences (14,263 bp) from those 18 species plus 50 percomrphs and two outgroups (total 70 species) were subjected to partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) analyses. The resulting trees not only indicated multiple origins of RLA pattern 10, but also revealed a highly supported, unexpected clade that solely comprises pelagic species placed in three (or possibly four) different perciform suborders (Percoidei, Stromateoidei, Scombroidei, and Trachinoidei). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Taxonomic sampling To address the origin of RLA pattern 10, we used 13 species having RLA pattern 10: three species from two stromateoid families (Centrolophidae and Nomeidae) plus 10 species from five percoid families (Arripidae, Kyphosidae, Terapontidae Kuhliidae, and Oplegnathidae). We also used 27 species from 10 percoid families and tetraodontiforms that have been hypothesized to be closely related to the members having RLA pattern 10, viz. Monodactylidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Ephippididae ( Gosline, 1985; Mok and Shen, 1983 ), Toxotidae, Enoplosidae, Pentacerotidae, Siganidae, Zanclidae, Acanthuridae, and Tetraodontiformes ( Mok and Shen, 1983 ). In addition, our analyses included whole mitogenome sequences from 28 percomorph species (sensu Miya et al., 2003, 2005 ). We did not use those percomorph species found in Clades A and B in Fig. 2 , because none of them have been assumed to be related to the members having RLA pattern 10 based on both morphological ( Gosline, 1985; Mok and Shen, 1983 ) and molecular ( Kawahara et al., 2008; Mabuchi et al., 2007; Miya et al., 2003, 2005; Setiamarga et al., 2008; Yamanoue et al., 2007 ) studies. As collective outgroups to root the trees, Polymixia japonica (Polymixiidae) and Beryx splendens (Berycidae) were selected with reference to Miya et al. (2003, 2005) . A list of the 70 species examined in this study is provided in Table 1 , along with DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Accession Nos. and references. 2.2 DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing Total genomic DNA was extracted using the Aquapure genomic DNA isolation kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) or DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen K.K.) from frozen or ethanol-preserved specimens, following each manufacturer’s protocol. The mitogenomes were amplified in their entirety using a long PCR technique ( Cheng et al., 1994 ). We used seven fish-versatile long PCR primers in the following five combinations: S-LA-16S-L + S-LA-16S-H; L2508-16S + H1065-12S; L2508-16S + H15149-CYB; L2508-16S + H12293-Leu; L12321-Leu + S-LA-16S-H (for locations and sequences of these primers, see Inoue et al., 2000, 2001; Ishiguro et al., 2001; Kawaguchi et al., 2001; Miya and Nishida, 2000 ) to amplify the entire mitogenome in two reactions. Long PCR reaction conditions followed Miya and Nishida (1999) . Long PCR products diluted with TE buffer (1:19) were subsequently used as templates for short PCR reactions employing fish-versatile PCR primers in various combinations to amplify contiguous, overlapping segments of the entire mitogenome. The short PCR reactions were carried out following protocols previously described ( Miya and Nishida, 1999 ), then purified using ExoSap-IT enzyme (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.), and subsequently sequenced with dye-labeled terminators (BigDye terminator ver. 3.1, Applied Biosystems) and the primers used in the short PCRs. Sequencing reactions were conducted following the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by electrophoresis on an ABI Prism 3100 or 3130 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A list of PCR primers used in this study is available from N.Y. upon request. 2.3 Sequence editing and alignment Sequence electropherograms were edited and analyzed with EditView ver. 1.0.1, AutoAssembler ver. 2.1 (Applied Biosystems), and DNASIS ver. 3.2 (Hitachi Software Engineering). Twelve protein coding (excluding ND6 gene because of its heterogeneous base composition), 22 tRNA, and two rRNA gene sequences for 70 species were aligned using ProAlign ver. 0.5a3 ( Löytynoja and Milinkovitch, 2003 ). All sequences from the L-strand-encoded eight tRNA genes were converted into complementary strand sequences. Amino acids were used for protein-coding sequence alignments. Aligned regions with posterior probabilities of ⩾70% were used for phylogenetic analyses. The complete dataset, which was built using MacClade 4.08 ( Maddison and Maddison, 2000 ), included 14,263 positions, comprising 12 protein-coding genes (10,851 positions), two rRNA genes (1964 positions), and 22 tRNA genes (1448 positions). 2.4 Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on three datasets: the first matrix (14,263 positions) includes all aligned positions of gene-coding regions of mitogenomic sequences (123 n RT n ; n denotes nucleotides); the second dataset (10,222 positions) includes all the concatenated nucleotide sequences of the mitogenomes except the third codon positions (12 n RT n ); and the third dataset (14,263 positions), which includes the same set of characters as the second dataset, but included transversion (R-Y) substitutions at the third codon positions of protein-coding genes (12 n 3 r RT n , r denotes RY-coding). This matrix was constructed by first replacing the third codon purines (A/G) with “R”, and the third codon pyrimidines (C/T) with “Y” ( Phillips and Penny, 2003; Phillips et al., 2004 ). The data matrices were then subjected to partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) analyses. Five (for 123 n RT n and 12 n 3 r RT n ) and four (for 12 n RT n ) partitions were set for each analysis. Partitioned ML analyses were performed with RAxML ver. 7.0.4 ( Stamatakis, 2006 ), a program implementing a novel, rapid-hill-climbing algorithm. For each dataset, a rapid bootstrap analysis and search for the best-scoring ML tree were conducted in one single program run, with the GTR + I + Γ nucleotide substitution model ( Yang, 1994 ). The rapid bootstrap analyses were conducted with 100 replications, with four threads running in parallel. The program finally conducted ML optimization for every 5th bootstrapped tree to search for the best-scoring ML tree. Partitioned BA analyses were conducted with MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 ( Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003 ) for the above three datasets. The GTR + I + Γ model was used for nucleotide substitution model. We assumed that all of the model parameters were unlinked, that the rate multipliers were variable across partitions, and used the default settings for the priors on the proportion of invariable sites (0–1) and gamma shape parameters (0.1–50.0). A Dirichlet distribution was assumed for the rate matrix and base frequencies, and every tree topology was assumed equally probable. For third codon positions in 12 n 3 r RT n coding, we used arbitrarily “A” and “C” instead of “R” and “Y” respectively, and set a single rate category for this partition (lset nst = 1) instead of six to avoid unnecessary estimation of transitional changes during the calculations. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process was set so that four chains (three heated and one cold) ran simultaneously. We conducted two independent runs of 10,000,000 cycles for 123 n RT n dataset, and 5,000,000 cycles for 12 n 3 r RT n and 12 n RT n datasets, with one in every 1000 trees being sampled. “Stationarity” (lack of improvement in the likelihood score) was checked graphically using Tracer ver. 1.4 (available from http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/ ) and all trees and parameters before stationarity were discarded as “burn-in.” After confirming agreement of the estimated parameters between the two independent runs using Tracer, we pooled all post “burn-in” trees from the two runs. Posterior probabilities of phylogenies and their internal branches were estimated on the basis of these pooled trees. 2.5 Testing alternative phylogenetic hypotheses Alternative tree topologies were compared to the best-scoring ML tree using the likelihood-based SH test ( Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 1999 ). We first created the constraint topologies considering monophyly of alternative hypotheses using MacClade and conducted ML analyses using RAxML with those constraints. The resulting constrained ML trees were used to compute the per-site log likelihoods using RAxML (–f g option) and outputs were subjected to SH tests using CONSEL ( Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 2001 ). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Mitochondrial genome organization The whole mitogenome sequences of the 18 species reported here for the first time were registered in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank ( Table 1 ). The genome contents, including two rRNA, 22 tRNA, 13 protein-coding genes, and control region, and gene arrangements were identical to those of typical vertebrates. 3.2 Percomorph phylogeny In an attempt to resolve higher-level relationships of the order Cypriniformes based on a partitioned Bayesian method of whole mitogenome sequences, Saitoh et al. (2006) performed detailed analyses of phylogenetic performance for the five partitions as used in this study and demonstrated that inclusion of the third codon position transitions (3 n ) led to erroneous estimations of phylogenies for the basal relationships of the cypriniforms. Following their suggestion, we considered that the results from the 12 n 3 r RT n dataset (RY-coding) represented the best estimate of phylogenies at this taxonomic level (within the percomorphs), which effectively removing likely noise from quickly saturated transitional changes in third codon positions and avoiding a lack of signal by retaining all available positions in the dataset. Accordingly, the resultant tree from the 12 n 3 r RT n data derived from the partitioned ML analysis (ln L = −234,460.757) is shown in Figs. 3 (cladogram) and 4 (phylogram), with statistical support [bootstrap probabilities (BPs) from the partitioned ML analysis and posterior probabilities (PPs) from the partitioned BA analysis] indicated on each internal branch. Topological differences between the results from the two analyses (partitioned ML and BA analyses) were minor and found only in the placement of Scomber scombrus (Scombridae), Kuhlia mugil (Kuhliidae) and Pomacanthidae (denoted by arrowheads in Fig. 3 ). Taxonomic contents of each clade examined here were as follows [clade names followed Kawahara et al. (2008) with some expansion, and we have not used any taxa from Clades A and B in Fig. 2 ]: Clade C (Gobioidei); Clade D (Dactylopteriformes); Clade E (Toxotidae, Pleuronectiformes, and Carangidae); Clade F (Scombridae, Arripidae, and Stromateoidei); Clade G (Scorpaenoidei); Clade H (Pentacerotidae, Monodactylidae, Pomacanthidae, Chaetodontidae, Sparidae, Acanthuroidei, Lophiiformes, Tetraodontiformes and newly including Enoplosidae, Terapontidae, Kyphosidae, Kuhliidae, and Oplegnathidae: clade including the latter four families tentatively named Clade h2). As noted in Kawahara et al. (2008) , despite differences in taxonomic coverage and molecular markers, these clades (except for the newly added fishes) have been repeatedly recovered in various combinations in previous studies ( Chen et al., 2003; Dettai and Lecointre, 2005; Holcroft, 2005; Kawahara et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009; Mabuchi et al., 2007; Miya et al., 2003, 2005; Smith and Wheeler, 2004; Setiamarga et al., 2008; Smith and Craig, 2007; Yamanoue et al., 2007 ), supporting the existence of these novel, previously unrecognized clades within the Percomorpha. 3.3 Origin of RLA pattern 10 Monophyly of the group having RLA pattern 10 has been suggested by Freihofer (1963), Johnson and Fritzsche (1989), and Leis and van der Lingen (1997) . However, in none of the analyses was the group having RLA pattern 10 recovered as monophyletic within the Percomorpha ( Fig. 3 ). Statistical comparisons using the likelihood-based SH test confidently rejected monophyly of the group having RLA pattern 10 (Δln L = –1102.9; p < 0.001). Leis and van der Lingen (1997) suggested the subgroup of the families having RLA pattern 10 which excludes Oplegnathidae and Stromateoidei to be monophyletic, based on similarities of larval characters, such as body form, opercular series spination, fin development and, most notably, distinctive pigmentation patterns. Oplegnathidae, however, was deeply nested in a highly supported clade within Clade H (Clade h2: BP/PP = 100%) comprising those percoids having RLA pattern 10. Stromateoidei, on the other hand, formed a highly-supported monophyletic group (Clade F: BP/PP = 100%) together with Arripidae (with RLA pattern 10) and Scombridae (without RLA pattern 10). Although we could not resolve interrelationships among Arripidae, Stromateoidei and Scombridae definitely, most parsimonious reconstruction of RLA pattern 10 on the present tree suggested that there are at least two independent origins of RLA pattern 10 in the percomorphs (common ancestors of Clade h2 and Stromateoidei + Arripidae, subsequently lost in Scombridae with the exception of Scomber for the latter clade). The homology reassessment of the facial nerve patterns between these two lineages is necessary for more correct understanding of the morphological similarities. Scombridae was presented as a non-monophyletic group in the present tree and future dense taxonomic sampling from the other scombroids together with other members of Clade F would clarify the issue. 3.4 Monophyly of Kyphosidae (sensu Nelson, 1994, 2006 ) Among the fishes in Clade h2, Girella , Kyphosus , Labracoglossa , Scorpis , and Microcanthus have been placed in the family Kyphosidae and treated as different subfamilies [Girellinae, Kyphosinae, Scorpidinae ( Labracoglossa and Scorpis ), and Microcanthinae] by Nelson (1994, 2006) . Although the monophyly of the Kyphosidae (sensu Nelson, 1994, 2006 ) was not rejected by a SH test (Δln L = –17.2; p = 0.552), these genera consistently failed to form a clade in either ML or BA analyses ( Fig. 3 ). The results are consistent with that of Yagishita et al. (2002) , suggesting that Kyphosidae (sensu Nelson, 1994, 2006 ) is not supposed to be monophyletic. 3.5 Clade F, a pelagic fish assemblage? One of the most unexpected findings in this study was that members of the Arripidae (Percoidei), Stromateoidei, and Scombridae (Scombroidei) formed a well-supported monophyletic group (Clade F; Fig. 3 ) in both ML and BA (BP/PP = 100%) analyses. The three percomorph taxa have been consistently placed in different suborders and no previous morphological studies have suggested such close relationships. Molecular studies, however, have repeatedly implied such relationships. Yagishita et al. (2002) , for example, analyzed mitochondrial ND2 gene sequences (678 bp) from 20 percomorphs with RLA pattern 10 and found that members of Arripidae and Stromateoidei formed a monophyletic group in the resulting trees, although the support values were relatively low (50–63% BPs and 59% quartet puzzling). Chen et al. (2003) conducted extensive taxonomic sampling from acanthomorphs (72 species), analyzed relatively long sequences from the combined mitochondrial and nuclear genes (2420 bp in total), and found that a scombrid, two stromateoids, and a trachinoid genus Kali (Chiasmodontidae: without RLA pattern 10) formed a monophyletic group with a high BP (97%). Subsequently Dettai and Lecointre (2005, 2008) recovered this monophyletic group with the same species based on different nuclear loci. Recently, Li et al. (2009) analyzed different nuclear marker, and demonstrated that a percoid genus Pterycombus (Bramidae: without RLA pattern 10) was included in the monophyletic group. It is therefore likely that members from (at least) four different perciform suborders (Percoidei, Stromateoidei, Scombroidei, and Trachinoidei) form a monophyletic group. It should be noted that the fishes included in this monophyletic group (Clade F in this study and Clade H in Chen et al., 2003; Dettai and Lecointre, 2005, 2008; Li et al., 2009 ) are morphologically diverse, but they are all dwellers of pelagic realm and often associated with long-distance migrations: scombrids are commonly pelagic and some species perform transoceanic migrations ( Collette, 2001 ); stromateoids are generally pelagic, actively swimming along continental slopes and shelves ( Helfman et al., 1997; McDowall, 2001 ); although arripids are nearshore pelagic fishes, they migrate long distances ( Ayvazian et al., 2004; Kuiter, 1993 ); chiasmodontids are also pelagic, but they may be lethargic because they are found in meso- and bathypelagic depths (200–2000 m; Mooi and Paxton, 2001 ); bramids are mostly true pelagic fishes ( Smith, 1986 ). Future addition of pelagic species from the percomorphs with unknown identity would further expand the limits of this distinct, previously unrecognized clade. 4 Concluding remarks The phylogenetic analyses of whole mitogenome sequences from the fishes having RLA pattern 10 and various percomorph fishes revealed that the fishes having RLA pattern 10 did not constitute a monophyletic group and suggested that there are at least two independent origins of this unique character: one in a common ancestor of inshore and reef fishes, Terapontidae, Kyphosidae, Kuhliidae, and Oplegnathidae and another one in that of pelagic fishes, Arripidae and Stromateoidei. We also found that the latter two taxa formed a highly-supported monophyletic group together with Scombridae (and possibly with Chiasmodontidae and Bramidae), a clade solely comprising pelagic fishes and further taxonomic sampling would warrant recognition of this previously unrecognized taxon that share the common ecological characteristic.
