    "full_text": "Parasites may manipulate host behavior to increase the odds of transmission or to reach the proper environment to complete their life cycle. 1 , 2 Members of the phylum Nematomorpha (known as horsehair worms, hairworms, or Gordian worms) are large endoparasites that affect the behavior of their arthropod hosts. In terrestrial hosts, they cause erratic movements toward bodies of water, 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 where the adult worm emerges from the host to find mates for reproduction. We present a chromosome-level genome assembly for the freshwater Acutogordius australiensis and a draft assembly for one of the few known marine species, Nectonema munidae . The assemblies span 201 Mbp and 213 Mbp in length (N50: 38 Mbp and 716 Kbp), respectively, and reveal four chromosomes in Acutogordius , which are largely rearranged compared to the inferred ancestral condition in animals. Both nematomorph genomes have a relatively low number of genes (11,114 and 8,717, respectively) and lack a high proportion (∼30%) of universal single-copy metazoan orthologs (BUSCO genes 7 ). We demonstrate that missing genes are not an artifact of the assembly process, with the majority of missing orthologs being shared by the two independent assemblies. Missing BUSCOs are enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with the organization of cilia and cell projections in other animals. We show that most cilium-related genes conserved across eukaryotes have been lost in Nematomorpha, providing a molecular basis for the suspected absence of ciliary structures in these animals."

              "Assemblies for two divergent species of hairworms ( Figure 1 ) were built with 30–48× coverage of Nanopore long reads and polished with 230–320× Illumina data. Acutogordius australiensis was additionally scaffolded with 126× coverage of short-read Hi-C data. Raw data and assembly statistics for both genomes are shown in Table S1 . For Acutogordius , we produced a chromosome-level assembly of 201 Mbp, 83.4% of which was assembled into four chromosome-scale scaffolds (scaffold N50 of 38 Mbp) ( Figure 2 ). Although chromosome number had never been estimated for this species, this result is consistent with the haploid number of 1–8 chromosomes determined for other species in the same family. 8 , 9 The assembled chromosomes have lengths between 36.3 Mbp and 46.6 Mbp. The remaining 1,319 small scaffolds represent 16.6% of the genome, with the largest representing less than 0.07% of the assembly ( Figure 2 ). The strong physical interactions shown in the contact map (bottom/right of Figure 2 A) indicate that most of these scaffolds belong to one of the four chromosomes. For comparison, the draft assembly of Acutogordius before scaffolding with Hi-C data had an N50 of 230 Kbp and 2,368 contigs.",
              "Despite limited tissue availability preventing us from obtaining Hi-C data for Nectonema munidae , the draft assembly has relatively high contiguity, with 1,061 scaffolds assembled into a 213 Mbp genome, and an N50 of 716.6 Kbp ( Figure 2 B). This is of greater quality than the draft assembly of Acutogordius before Hi-C mapping, which can be at least partially explained by variation in heterozygosity: 0.71% in Nectonema compared to a high level of 3.72% in Acutogordius , as estimated with GenomeScope. 10"

              "Deep conservation of chromosomal linkages has been recognized across metazoan phyla, with 29 ancestral linkage groups (ALGs) inferred for Metazoa. 11 However, like in fruit flies and nematodes, 11 the genome of nematomorphs has been substantially rearranged into few chromosomes, and most orthologs from ALG origin are now dispersed throughout the genome of Acutogordius ( Figure 3 A). Still, it is possible to recognize blocks of conserved synteny: two equivalences tie ALG_M to scaffold_3 and ALG_O2 to scaffold_4, scaffold_2 seems to be the product of an end-to-end fusion with mixing of ALG_A1a and ALG_L, and a centric insertion of ALG_I into ALG_D formed scaffold_1 ( Figure 3 A).",
              "Repetitive elements comprise 49.41% and 53.47% of the genome of Acutogordius and Nectonema ( Figure 3 B), respectively. Interspersed repeats make up the majority of repetitive regions, with a high proportion of unclassified repeats (27%–34%), followed by DNA transposons (8%–16%). Prediction of protein coding genes revealed 11,114 and 8,717 genes in each of the assemblies. There is a positive relationship between number of genes and scaffold size, with the majority of predicted genes in Acutogordius being located on the four chromosome-level scaffolds, which contain 2,611, 2,775, 1,841, and 1,962 genes ( Figure 3 C). The number of genes in nematomorphs is notably lower than in other animals, and at the lower end of the range for parasitic worms (6,712–17,274 genes/species in nematodes and flatworms 12 , 13 ). Other parasites with the smallest animal genomes ever recorded include myxozoan cnidarians ( Myxobolus cerebralis at 22.5 Mpb and 5,533 genes 14 ) and orthonectids ( Intoshia variabili at 15.3 Mbp and 5,120 genes; 15 I. linei at 43.2 Mbp and ∼9,000 genes 16 , 17 ). In a comparison of representative protostomes, free-living taxa hold more species-specific orthogroups than parasitic ones ( Figure S1 ), possibly reflecting a tendency of parasitic lineages toward smaller genomes. Still, nematomorphs reveal many lineage-specific orthologs (886 in Acutogordius , 449 in Nectonema ), even when compared to other parasites ( Figure S1 ). Future functional analyses across clades will help determine which genes lost or gained by Nematomorpha could be related to their parasitic lifestyle.",
              "In addition to the low number of protein-coding genes, a reduction of non-coding DNA has been noted in some parasitic species (e.g., orthonectids, 16 nematodes, 13 and plants 18 ). In nematomorphs, however, loss of genes does not seem to be accompanied by genome streamlining. The average number of introns per gene (7.1 in Acutogordius , 5.1 in Nectonema ) is similar to that in other protostomes, regardless of lifestyle ( Figure 3 D). Furthermore, intron size and intergenic distances are larger than in free-living relatives ( Figures 3 E and 3F).",
              "Of all predicted genes, functional annotations were obtained for 4,670 genes in Acutogordius and for 3,910 in Nectonema . Three regulatory muscle proteins have been identified on the body wall musculature of a Gordian worm based on immunocytochemistry, 19 of which caldesmon was unexpected for never having been detected in the genomes of invertebrates. 20 In our two nematomorph assemblies, no homolog was detected for caldesmon, supporting that results from electron microscopy imaging were likely a false positive from antibodies binding to other unknown proteins in the tissue. 19 For the other two proteins, we identified 5–6 genes with homology to calponin domains and 1–2 genes annotated as troponins."

              "Notably, evaluating our two nematomorph assemblies against a curated dataset of metazoan single-copy orthologs (BUSCO, benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs 7 ) revealed that over 30% of such widely conserved genes are missing in the genomes of horsehair worms ( Figure 2 B). To investigate whether this could be an artifact of the assembly process, we first compared the sets of missing genes, finding that the missing orthologs in the two nematomorph genomes largely overlap ( Figure 4 A). If the quality of the assemblies was responsible for missing BUSCOs, we would expect missing genes to be randomly distributed in the genomes. Instead, we found that such a large identity overlap of 220 missing genes would be statistically implausible (p < 2.2e−16, χ 2 = 339.3, df = 1).",
              "We then considered the fact that, even with high-quality genomes, sequences that are highly derived compared to the reference clade might artificially display more missing BUSCOs due to strong sequence divergence preventing recognition of orthologs. 7 While this could be responsible for some of the genes missing in our assemblies, we note that other divergent phyla of Ecdysozoa with no representation in the reference Metazoa database show much lower proportions of missing BUSCOs, even with less contiguous assemblies, such as velvet worms (Onychophora, 3.7%) 21 and penis worms (Priapulida, 3%). 22 Even the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , well known for its small genome of 100 Mbp, has only 11% missing BUSCOs. 7 Evolutionary divergence alone is therefore not expected to be the cause of the large amount of undetected BUSCOs in nematomorphs.",
              "To investigate the nature of the missing universal genes, we did a functional enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology terms in the set of 220 missing genes compared to all 954 orthologs in the metazoan BUSCO dataset. We found that Biological Processes (BP) and Cellular Component (CC) terms that in other animals are associated with cilium and cell projection assembly are strongly over-represented in the set of genes missing in Nematomorpha ( Figures 4 B and S2 A). Overall, 112 missing BUSCOs were significant for 43 terms ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Importantly, terms with the lowest p values in the enrichment analysis (red colors in Figure 4 B) represent functions for which most genes in the background metazoan set are missing in nematomorphs ( Figure 4 C). For example, of the 14 genes associated with the top BP term (GO:0030030: cell projection organization) in the background set of metazoan BUSCOs, 13 are missing in both nematomorph genomes ( Figures 4 B and 4C; Table S2 ). The top 10 terms with the most significant loss of genes are all connected to cilium assembly, cell projection organization, and microtubule cytoskeleton ( Figure 4 C). Other enriched terms with related functions include organelle organization, cellular localization, and intracellular transport ( Figure 4 C).",
              "Nematomorpha is one of the few animal phyla with no conclusive evidence for cilia. 23 , 24 Defined as organelles containing a microtubule-based cytoskeleton (axoneme) and supported by a basal body, 23 , 25 cilia are conserved at an even broader evolutionary level, sharing a similar ultrastructure across eukaryotes. 26 , 27 Mechano- and chemosensory perception, as well as male gamete motility, are some of the important roles played by ciliary structures across animals. 23 Nematomorphs, however, are known for aflagellate spermatozoa, 28 and despite ultrastructural studies spanning different species, developmental stages, and body regions, 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 only one uncertain instance of a microtubule-like feature in a cell projection has been recorded. 33 , 34 Our findings provide a molecular basis for the lack of cilia, with evidence that the genomic machinery responsible for making cilia no longer exists in the genomes of nematomorphs. The congruent gene loss in our two species, which represent the sister lineages Nectonematoidea (marine) and Gordioidea (freshwater), 35 further implies that this substantial genomic reduction very likely happened in the ancestor of modern nematomorphs.",
              "In animals, cilia have a prominent role in sensory structures. A search for selected functional terms related to sensory genes in the genome annotations of Acutogordius and Nectonema resulted in less than 20 genes for each species. In ecdysozoan relatives, some of these gene families are extremely rich. For example, C. elegans boasts over 1,300 predicted G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 36 and D. melanogaster about 200. 37 GPCRs are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including visual and olfactory senses. It is plausible that the absence of such genes in nematomorphs could be related to loss of sensory structures associated with cilia. While obligate parasitism has been tentatively linked to a reduction of sensory genes in some nematodes, 38 nematomorph adults and early larvae are free-living, presumably having some recognition mechanism for finding mates and hosts. Given the number of lineage-specific orthologs in nematomorphs, and of genes that cannot be annotated by homology, it is conceivable that the phylum might have unique sensory structures and pathways that remain to be characterized."

              "The specimen of Nectonema munidae had been preserved in RNA later in −80°C for nearly 10 years, while specimens of Acutogordius australiensis were likewise preserved for under 1 year. Noteworthy laboratory observations are described to help inform future long-read sequencing of museum specimens. When extracting high-molecular-weight DNA, a high-salt method provided the highest yields and the longest fragments ( Figure S3 ). Initial attempts to sequence a genomic library in the Nanopore MinION device resulted in very low pore occupancy and almost no yield. We observed the same issue with other non-model invertebrate taxa, with initial pore occupancy as low as one active pore for a library made from mollusk tissue preserved in 95% EtOH at −20°C for about 5 years. We discovered that extending the DNA repair and end-prep step from the 5 min in the standard protocol to 30 min produced the expected optimal pore occupancy and high sequencing yield. We also used the PreCR Repair Mix (NEB) following DNA extraction as an additional measure to repair DNA. Applying the extended repair steps was successful for all taxa. 21 , 22",
              "Decline in pore occupancy throughout the run is a typical feature of ONT sequencing. We found that washing the flow cell when the rate of new output is reduced (at ∼24 h) rescues unavailable pores and significantly increases yield ( Figure S4 ). This entailed starting library preparation with up to 2 μg of input DNA whenever possible and splitting libraries into two aliquots of 400–600 ng, but smaller aliquots were also successful as a second load. For Nectonema , for example, one wash doubled the yield of the run to 10.3 Gb ( Figure S3 ), with the second load containing about 200 ng of DNA.",
              "Finally, a taxon-specific behavior was observed in handling nematomorph DNA. While the Short Read Eliminator kit (Circulomics; now Pacific Biosciences) was successfully used for size selection in other taxa we worked with, the DNA of Acutogordius consistently failed to precipitate, despite increased centrifugation time. We alternatively tried size selection with SPRI beads, but the DNA likewise remained in the supernatant despite extensive incubation times with the beads. It is unclear what caused these behaviors, possibly some undetected carryover from the DNA extractions. These size selection methods, therefore, were not applied in the final protocol, which nonetheless resulted in high-quality assemblies.",
              "Gordioid horsehair worms are common parasites with notable effects on lotic systems, infecting a suite of host species in natural communities 39 , 40 , 41 and drastically altering food webs and the energy flow in forest-stream ecosystems. 5 , 42 They accelerate the development of paratenic hosts 43 and shape the behavior of definitive hosts, 3 , 6 , 44 in addition to being able to survive long periods in the digestive tract of predators that consume host species. 45 Despite their unique biology and ecological role, Nematomorpha is among the 10 animal phyla for which genomic representation has so far been neglected. 46 Here we present contiguous genomes for the two lineages of nematomorphs. We demonstrate extensive chromosomal rearrangement, a large number of lineage-specific orthologs of unknown function, and pervasive loss of universal metazoan genes, providing the molecular foundation that explains their lack of ciliary structures. These genomic resources will serve as an atlas of nematomorph gene repertoire, opening new avenues for investigating the genomic mechanisms underlying parasitism, control of host behavior, and genome reduction."

    "full_text": "Results and discussion A chromosome-level assembly for Nematomorpha Assemblies for two divergent species of hairworms ( Figure 1 ) were built with 30–48× coverage of Nanopore long reads and polished with 230–320× Illumina data. Acutogordius australiensis was additionally scaffolded with 126× coverage of short-read Hi-C data. Raw data and assembly statistics for both genomes are shown in Table S1 . For Acutogordius , we produced a chromosome-level assembly of 201 Mbp, 83.4% of which was assembled into four chromosome-scale scaffolds (scaffold N50 of 38 Mbp) ( Figure 2 ). Although chromosome number had never been estimated for this species, this result is consistent with the haploid number of 1–8 chromosomes determined for other species in the same family. 8 , 9 The assembled chromosomes have lengths between 36.3 Mbp and 46.6 Mbp. The remaining 1,319 small scaffolds represent 16.6% of the genome, with the largest representing less than 0.07% of the assembly ( Figure 2 ). The strong physical interactions shown in the contact map (bottom/right of Figure 2 A) indicate that most of these scaffolds belong to one of the four chromosomes. For comparison, the draft assembly of Acutogordius before scaffolding with Hi-C data had an N50 of 230 Kbp and 2,368 contigs. Despite limited tissue availability preventing us from obtaining Hi-C data for Nectonema munidae , the draft assembly has relatively high contiguity, with 1,061 scaffolds assembled into a 213 Mbp genome, and an N50 of 716.6 Kbp ( Figure 2 B). This is of greater quality than the draft assembly of Acutogordius before Hi-C mapping, which can be at least partially explained by variation in heterozygosity: 0.71% in Nectonema compared to a high level of 3.72% in Acutogordius , as estimated with GenomeScope. 10 Genome architecture and annotation Deep conservation of chromosomal linkages has been recognized across metazoan phyla, with 29 ancestral linkage groups (ALGs) inferred for Metazoa. 11 However, like in fruit flies and nematodes, 11 the genome of nematomorphs has been substantially rearranged into few chromosomes, and most orthologs from ALG origin are now dispersed throughout the genome of Acutogordius ( Figure 3 A). Still, it is possible to recognize blocks of conserved synteny: two equivalences tie ALG_M to scaffold_3 and ALG_O2 to scaffold_4, scaffold_2 seems to be the product of an end-to-end fusion with mixing of ALG_A1a and ALG_L, and a centric insertion of ALG_I into ALG_D formed scaffold_1 ( Figure 3 A). Repetitive elements comprise 49.41% and 53.47% of the genome of Acutogordius and Nectonema ( Figure 3 B), respectively. Interspersed repeats make up the majority of repetitive regions, with a high proportion of unclassified repeats (27%–34%), followed by DNA transposons (8%–16%). Prediction of protein coding genes revealed 11,114 and 8,717 genes in each of the assemblies. There is a positive relationship between number of genes and scaffold size, with the majority of predicted genes in Acutogordius being located on the four chromosome-level scaffolds, which contain 2,611, 2,775, 1,841, and 1,962 genes ( Figure 3 C). The number of genes in nematomorphs is notably lower than in other animals, and at the lower end of the range for parasitic worms (6,712–17,274 genes/species in nematodes and flatworms 12 , 13 ). Other parasites with the smallest animal genomes ever recorded include myxozoan cnidarians ( Myxobolus cerebralis at 22.5 Mpb and 5,533 genes 14 ) and orthonectids ( Intoshia variabili at 15.3 Mbp and 5,120 genes; 15 I. linei at 43.2 Mbp and ∼9,000 genes 16 , 17 ). In a comparison of representative protostomes, free-living taxa hold more species-specific orthogroups than parasitic ones ( Figure S1 ), possibly reflecting a tendency of parasitic lineages toward smaller genomes. Still, nematomorphs reveal many lineage-specific orthologs (886 in Acutogordius , 449 in Nectonema ), even when compared to other parasites ( Figure S1 ). Future functional analyses across clades will help determine which genes lost or gained by Nematomorpha could be related to their parasitic lifestyle. In addition to the low number of protein-coding genes, a reduction of non-coding DNA has been noted in some parasitic species (e.g., orthonectids, 16 nematodes, 13 and plants 18 ). In nematomorphs, however, loss of genes does not seem to be accompanied by genome streamlining. The average number of introns per gene (7.1 in Acutogordius , 5.1 in Nectonema ) is similar to that in other protostomes, regardless of lifestyle ( Figure 3 D). Furthermore, intron size and intergenic distances are larger than in free-living relatives ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Of all predicted genes, functional annotations were obtained for 4,670 genes in Acutogordius and for 3,910 in Nectonema . Three regulatory muscle proteins have been identified on the body wall musculature of a Gordian worm based on immunocytochemistry, 19 of which caldesmon was unexpected for never having been detected in the genomes of invertebrates. 20 In our two nematomorph assemblies, no homolog was detected for caldesmon, supporting that results from electron microscopy imaging were likely a false positive from antibodies binding to other unknown proteins in the tissue. 19 For the other two proteins, we identified 5–6 genes with homology to calponin domains and 1–2 genes annotated as troponins. Rampant loss of universal metazoan genes Notably, evaluating our two nematomorph assemblies against a curated dataset of metazoan single-copy orthologs (BUSCO, benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs 7 ) revealed that over 30% of such widely conserved genes are missing in the genomes of horsehair worms ( Figure 2 B). To investigate whether this could be an artifact of the assembly process, we first compared the sets of missing genes, finding that the missing orthologs in the two nematomorph genomes largely overlap ( Figure 4 A). If the quality of the assemblies was responsible for missing BUSCOs, we would expect missing genes to be randomly distributed in the genomes. Instead, we found that such a large identity overlap of 220 missing genes would be statistically implausible (p < 2.2e−16, χ 2 = 339.3, df = 1). We then considered the fact that, even with high-quality genomes, sequences that are highly derived compared to the reference clade might artificially display more missing BUSCOs due to strong sequence divergence preventing recognition of orthologs. 7 While this could be responsible for some of the genes missing in our assemblies, we note that other divergent phyla of Ecdysozoa with no representation in the reference Metazoa database show much lower proportions of missing BUSCOs, even with less contiguous assemblies, such as velvet worms (Onychophora, 3.7%) 21 and penis worms (Priapulida, 3%). 22 Even the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , well known for its small genome of 100 Mbp, has only 11% missing BUSCOs. 7 Evolutionary divergence alone is therefore not expected to be the cause of the large amount of undetected BUSCOs in nematomorphs. To investigate the nature of the missing universal genes, we did a functional enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology terms in the set of 220 missing genes compared to all 954 orthologs in the metazoan BUSCO dataset. We found that Biological Processes (BP) and Cellular Component (CC) terms that in other animals are associated with cilium and cell projection assembly are strongly over-represented in the set of genes missing in Nematomorpha ( Figures 4 B and S2 A). Overall, 112 missing BUSCOs were significant for 43 terms ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Importantly, terms with the lowest p values in the enrichment analysis (red colors in Figure 4 B) represent functions for which most genes in the background metazoan set are missing in nematomorphs ( Figure 4 C). For example, of the 14 genes associated with the top BP term (GO:0030030: cell projection organization) in the background set of metazoan BUSCOs, 13 are missing in both nematomorph genomes ( Figures 4 B and 4C; Table S2 ). The top 10 terms with the most significant loss of genes are all connected to cilium assembly, cell projection organization, and microtubule cytoskeleton ( Figure 4 C). Other enriched terms with related functions include organelle organization, cellular localization, and intracellular transport ( Figure 4 C). Nematomorpha is one of the few animal phyla with no conclusive evidence for cilia. 23 , 24 Defined as organelles containing a microtubule-based cytoskeleton (axoneme) and supported by a basal body, 23 , 25 cilia are conserved at an even broader evolutionary level, sharing a similar ultrastructure across eukaryotes. 26 , 27 Mechano- and chemosensory perception, as well as male gamete motility, are some of the important roles played by ciliary structures across animals. 23 Nematomorphs, however, are known for aflagellate spermatozoa, 28 and despite ultrastructural studies spanning different species, developmental stages, and body regions, 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 only one uncertain instance of a microtubule-like feature in a cell projection has been recorded. 33 , 34 Our findings provide a molecular basis for the lack of cilia, with evidence that the genomic machinery responsible for making cilia no longer exists in the genomes of nematomorphs. The congruent gene loss in our two species, which represent the sister lineages Nectonematoidea (marine) and Gordioidea (freshwater), 35 further implies that this substantial genomic reduction very likely happened in the ancestor of modern nematomorphs. In animals, cilia have a prominent role in sensory structures. A search for selected functional terms related to sensory genes in the genome annotations of Acutogordius and Nectonema resulted in less than 20 genes for each species. In ecdysozoan relatives, some of these gene families are extremely rich. For example, C. elegans boasts over 1,300 predicted G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 36 and D. melanogaster about 200. 37 GPCRs are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including visual and olfactory senses. It is plausible that the absence of such genes in nematomorphs could be related to loss of sensory structures associated with cilia. While obligate parasitism has been tentatively linked to a reduction of sensory genes in some nematodes, 38 nematomorph adults and early larvae are free-living, presumably having some recognition mechanism for finding mates and hosts. Given the number of lineage-specific orthologs in nematomorphs, and of genes that cannot be annotated by homology, it is conceivable that the phylum might have unique sensory structures and pathways that remain to be characterized. Long-read sequencing of museum specimens The specimen of Nectonema munidae had been preserved in RNA later in −80°C for nearly 10 years, while specimens of Acutogordius australiensis were likewise preserved for under 1 year. Noteworthy laboratory observations are described to help inform future long-read sequencing of museum specimens. When extracting high-molecular-weight DNA, a high-salt method provided the highest yields and the longest fragments ( Figure S3 ). Initial attempts to sequence a genomic library in the Nanopore MinION device resulted in very low pore occupancy and almost no yield. We observed the same issue with other non-model invertebrate taxa, with initial pore occupancy as low as one active pore for a library made from mollusk tissue preserved in 95% EtOH at −20°C for about 5 years. We discovered that extending the DNA repair and end-prep step from the 5 min in the standard protocol to 30 min produced the expected optimal pore occupancy and high sequencing yield. We also used the PreCR Repair Mix (NEB) following DNA extraction as an additional measure to repair DNA. Applying the extended repair steps was successful for all taxa. 21 , 22 Decline in pore occupancy throughout the run is a typical feature of ONT sequencing. We found that washing the flow cell when the rate of new output is reduced (at ∼24 h) rescues unavailable pores and significantly increases yield ( Figure S4 ). This entailed starting library preparation with up to 2 μg of input DNA whenever possible and splitting libraries into two aliquots of 400–600 ng, but smaller aliquots were also successful as a second load. For Nectonema , for example, one wash doubled the yield of the run to 10.3 Gb ( Figure S3 ), with the second load containing about 200 ng of DNA. Finally, a taxon-specific behavior was observed in handling nematomorph DNA. While the Short Read Eliminator kit (Circulomics; now Pacific Biosciences) was successfully used for size selection in other taxa we worked with, the DNA of Acutogordius consistently failed to precipitate, despite increased centrifugation time. We alternatively tried size selection with SPRI beads, but the DNA likewise remained in the supernatant despite extensive incubation times with the beads. It is unclear what caused these behaviors, possibly some undetected carryover from the DNA extractions. These size selection methods, therefore, were not applied in the final protocol, which nonetheless resulted in high-quality assemblies. Gordioid horsehair worms are common parasites with notable effects on lotic systems, infecting a suite of host species in natural communities 39 , 40 , 41 and drastically altering food webs and the energy flow in forest-stream ecosystems. 5 , 42 They accelerate the development of paratenic hosts 43 and shape the behavior of definitive hosts, 3 , 6 , 44 in addition to being able to survive long periods in the digestive tract of predators that consume host species. 45 Despite their unique biology and ecological role, Nematomorpha is among the 10 animal phyla for which genomic representation has so far been neglected. 46 Here we present contiguous genomes for the two lineages of nematomorphs. We demonstrate extensive chromosomal rearrangement, a large number of lineage-specific orthologs of unknown function, and pervasive loss of universal metazoan genes, providing the molecular foundation that explains their lack of ciliary structures. These genomic resources will serve as an atlas of nematomorph gene repertoire, opening new avenues for investigating the genomic mechanisms underlying parasitism, control of host behavior, and genome reduction.

Experimental model and subject details Specimen data Specimens of Acutogordius australiensis and Nectonema munidae are deposited at the Museum of Comparative Zoology ( https://mczbase.mcz.harvard.edu/guid/MCZ:IZ:152393 , https://mczbase.mcz.harvard.edu/guid/MCZ:IZ:153622 ; Table S1 ). Nectonema munidae was collected from inside the squat lobster host Munida sp. in 2010, in a well-known locality for this species in Norway. Acutogordius australiensis was so far known from a single male collected in Queensland, Australia. 78 Our specimens, collected in 2019 in New South Wales, match the original illustrations and the English diagnosis provided in a literature review of the genus. 79 The posterior end of the body has a broad post-cloacal crescent, semicircular and not extending over the base of the tail lobes, and with abundant cone-shaped spines in the region posterior to the crescent ( Figure 1 B). The tail region of a male was cut and mounted on bi-adhesive carbon tape on a SEM stub. The specimen was coated with 20 nm of Pt–Pd (80:20) in a HAR 050 EMS 300T D dual head sputter coater at the Center for Nanoscale Systems, Harvard University. Specimens were then imaged using a Zeiss FESEM Ultra Plus using an SE2 detector with an EHT target of 5 kV. All images are accessible through the voucher link. Method details DNA extraction and sequencing For each specimen, high-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from a tissue clip using a high salt protocol from the Donnan Laboratories, University of Liverpool (the DNA pellet of Acutogordius was eluted overnight). The DNA was then repaired with the PreCR Repair Mix (New England Biolabs), and cleaned off contaminants with a chloroform cleanup. 80 , 81 The quantity and quality of resuspended DNA were measured with a Qubit fluorometer and a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the fragment size distribution was assessed with a TapeStation Genomic DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies) ( Figure S3 ). For short-read sequencing, a whole-genome shotgun library was prepared using the KAPA HyperPlus library preparation kit (Roche), starting with about 100 ng of input DNA. For Acutogordius only, a second library was prepared using the Arima Hi-C kit (Arima Genomics) and the Kapa HyperPrep kit (Roche), starting from a flash-frozen tissue clip of the same specimen. Libraries were dual-indexed and sequenced for paired ends of 150 bp in an Illumina NovaSeq S4 flow cell, pooled with unrelated libraries at the Bauer Core Facility at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), Harvard University. For long-read sequencing, libraries were prepared following the Genomic DNA by Ligation protocol from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (SQK-LSK109, v.14Aug2019), with the following modifications: increased incubation times for the DNA repair and end-prep step (30 min at each temperature); skipping the first bead cleanup; doubling the incubation times for the second bead cleanup. Two MinION flow cells were used for Acutogordius , and one for Nectonema . Whenever possible, we started library preparation with more than 1 μg of input DNA, so that the final library was concentrated enough to be split into two volumes. The second aliquot was loaded in the same flow cell in the middle of the sequencing run after a wash (ONT protocol EXP-WSH003, v.18Sep2019) to increase yield. Run statistics were visualized with NanoPlot v1.29.0 49 ( Figure S4 ). Estimation of genome size Genome size and heterozygosity were estimated with a k-mer approach using Jellyfish v2.2.5 48 and GenomeScope. 10 Genome assembly ONT long-reads were basecalled with Guppy v4.5.2 and assembled with Flye v2.8.1. 50 Long reads were then mapped back to the assembly with BWA v0.7.17 51 and used to polish the assembly with Racon v1.4.21 52 and Medaka v1.3.2. Haplotigs and contig overlaps were removed with purge_dups v1.2.5, 53 and the assembly was polished with HyPo v1.0.3 55 using Illumina short-reads preprocessed with TrimGalore. 54 Contaminant contigs in the assembly were identified and removed with BlobTools2 in the BlobToolKit v2.5.0. 56 , 82 For the assembly of Acutogordius , we further mapped Hi-C reads to the draft assembly using Arima Genomics' pipeline A160156_v02 ( https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline ), followed by scaffolding with YaHS v1.2a.2. 57 The contact map was visualized in JuiceBox. 58 , 83 Completeness of the assemblies was evaluated with BUSCO v5.4.5 by comparison with the metazoa_odb10 database. 7 Snailplots for assembly statistics were plotted with assembly-stats v17.02. 60 RNA sequencing For Acutogordius , RNA was extracted from a second specimen with the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). A library was prepared with the Kapa mRNA HyperPrep kit (Roche) and sequenced for 150 bp paired-end reads in an Illumina NovaSeq S4 flow cell at the Bauer Core Facility at Harvard University. We used TrimGalore 54 to trim raw reads of Acutogordius and of the published RNA-seq data of Nectonema munidae (SRX5417513 47 ), derived from the same specimen used here for genome sequencing. Genome annotation For each species, a library of repetitive elements was built using RepeatModeler2 v2.0.2, 61 and repeats were masked in the respective assemblies using RepeatMasker v.4.1.2. 62 Cleaned RNA-seq reads were mapped to the assemblies with HISAT2 v2.1.0 63 and used to inform gene predictions during annotation of the masked assemblies with BRAKER2 v2.1.6. 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 Functional annotations were added to the final protein predictions using eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7, 70 , 71 with settings to report only alignments equal or above an identity threshold of 40%, and query and subject coverage fraction thresholds of 20%. To identify genes related to sensory organs, we screened the eggNOG output for the terms 'opsin', 'GPCR', '7 transmembrane receptor', 'olfactory', and 'visual'. Comparative analyses with other protostomes We compared the two new nematomorph genomes with other representative parasitic and free-living taxa, focusing on the distribution of non-coding regions in the genome, and on lineage-specific and shared orthologous genes. The following assemblies were downloaded from NCBI (unless otherwise noted): nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans (GCF_000002985.6), Pristionchus pacificus (GCA_000180635.4), Angiostrongylus cantonensis (GCA_009735665.1), and Loa loa (GCF_000183805.2); arthropod Drosophila melanogaster (GCA_000001215.4), platyhelminthes Schmidtea mediterranea (WormBase ParaSite: SmedGD_v1.3) and Schistosoma haematobium (GCF_000699445.3); orthonectid Intoshia linei (GCA_001642005.1). Orthologs were identified with OrthoFinder v2.5.4 72 using the fasta file of annotated proteins of each species ( Figure S1 ). Introns and intergenic distances were calculated as the distance between exons or between transcripts for the longest isoform of each gene from GTF annotation files. Synteny Orthologs belonging to ancestral linkage groups (ALGs) were identified in the assembly of Acutogordius australiensis and visualized in Oxford dot plots with odp v0.3.0. 73 Orthologous relationships were determined by odp with reciprocal best diamond blastp matches, and significant interactions between chromosomes calculated with Fisher's exact test (opaque dots in the plot representing p values ≤ 0.05). To create the required .chrom input file of protein locations, we first used a custom script (gtf_to_gff.py) to convert our GTF annotation file to a GFF file. We then slightly modified the script NCBIgff2chrom.py from odp to process our file instead of those derived from NCBI. Functional enrichment The list of 954 BUSCO gene IDs from the metazoa_odb10 database 59 was used to obtain specific and ancestral Gene Ontology (GO) terms from the OrthoDB v10 database 74 ( https://v10.orthodb.org/ , accessed on February 14, 2023) with a custom python script (buscos_to_GO.py). We then performed a hypergeometric enrichment analysis using the 220 genes missing from both Acutogordius australiensis and Nectonema munidae as the gene set of interest, and the entire metazoan dataset as the background set of genes. The over-representation analysis was done for each of the three GO categories (Biological Process, Cellular Component, Molecular Function) with the clusterProfiler package 75 , 76 in R. 77 Acknowledgments Computations were run on the FASRC Cannon cluster supported by the FAS Division of Science Research Computing Group at Harvard University , and on the cluster of the Grainger Bioinformatics Center at the Field Museum.
