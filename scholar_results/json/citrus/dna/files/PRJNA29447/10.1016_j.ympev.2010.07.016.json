          "The small, enigmatic Western Australian fish, Lepidogalaxias salamandroides , has been the subject of debate, ever since its description by Mees (1961) . Mees was uncertain when placing it in Galaxiidae, because it possesses scales (unlike other galaxiids), and also has a suite of distinctive characters ( Frankenberg, 1969; Fink, 1984 ), Frankenberg (1969) drew attention to its distinctive morphology but made no explicit recommendations about its taxonomic positions, while McDowall (1969) in a review of southern ‘galaxioids,’ suggested that Lepidogalaxias is not a galaxiid. Rosen (1974) controversially suggested that its closest relatives were among northern Esocidae, whereas Fink (1984) was perplexed, concluding that Lepidogalaxias is a sister group of neoteleosts. Johnson and Patterson (1996) , equally controversially, described Lepidogalaxias as a sister taxon to the Tasmanian Lovettia , a conclusion supported by Nelson (2006) . Williams (1997) , however, suggested that Lepidogalaxias is a sister group of all other galaxiids. All of these hypotheses of relationships were based largely on morphological characters and were based on the examination of a narrow range of potentially related fishes. Waters et al. (2000) concluded that Lepidogalaxias is not a galaxiid based on mitochondrial DNA sequences, but again, Waters et al.’s (2000) study was based on a limited diversity of fish genera. Ishiguro et al. (2003) attempted to unravel relationships among basal euteleost fishes by examining DNA sequences of a broader range of genera, but did not examine Lepidogalaxias . Given all these divergent conclusions, determining relationships of Lepidogalaxias is of considerable interest and in our view can only be resolved by studying a broader range of lower euteleostean fishes than hitherto, which is our purpose here.",
          "Hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships should be examined within the context of modern higher-level classifications of teleostean fishes, which began with Greenwood et al. (1966) , who grouped teleostean fishes into three major divisions. Their division III or Euteleostei ( Greenwood et al., 1967 ), includes five superorders: Protacanthopterygii, Ostariophysi, Paracanthopterygii, Atherinomorpha, and Acanthopterygii. The composition of the euteleostean group has changed since its inception. Ostariophysi was removed from Euteleostei and placed in subdivision Otocephala by Lecointre and Nelson (1996) . Then Protacanthopterygii, within Euteleostei was limited to only Argentiniformes (Argentinoidei and Alepocephaloidei) and Salmoniformes (Salmonoidei and Osmeroidei), by Johnson and Patterson (1996) (see Fig. 1 a); all remaining euteleosts, apart from Esociformes, were combined in Neoteleostei ( Johnson, 1992 ). Using mitogenomic data, Alepocephaloidei and Sundasalangidae were removed from Euteleostei, and placed in subdivision Otocephala ( Ishiguro et al., 2003, 2005; Lavoué et al., 2008 ). Where Lepidogalaxias fits among these higher groups is a question of great interest.",
          "There is no general consensus on relationships among lower euteleosts, as summarized by Johnson and Patterson (1996) . Incongruence among morphology-based hypotheses has been attributed to difficulty in correctly coding and weighting of morphological characters (e.g. Waters et al., 2002; López et al., 2004 ). Molecular evidence provides another way of reconstructing interrelationships of these fishes ( Ishiguro et al., 2003 ). Three major molecule-based hypotheses ( Fig. 1 c–e) have consistently revealed sister-relationships between salmoniforms and esociforms ( Ishiguro et al., 2003; López et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008 ), despite their separation using morphological data ( Johnson and Patterson, 1996 ). However, disagreement persists about the positions of Argentiniformes and Osmeriformes, as indicated by three different molecular-based hypotheses ( Fig. 1 c–e). In addition, none of these molecular studies has included Lepidogalaxias .",
          "In this study, we extend the work of Ishiguro et al. (2003) , and include Lepidogalaxias in a study of lower euteleost relationships, adding eight new mitochondrial genomes. Our specific goals were to (1) evaluate the phylogenetic position of Lepidogalaxias , and (2) clarify interrelationships among lower euteleostean orders."

ND6 gene and control region were excluded because of their heterogeneous base composition ( Miya and Nishida, 2000 ). Protein-coding genes were aligned based on translated amino acid sequences using Clustal W as implemented in DAMBE version 5.1.1 ( Xia and Xie, 2001 ). After alignment, they were translated back to nucleotide sequences. Non-coding genes (two rRNAs and twenty-two tRNAs) were aligned individually using MUSCLE ver. 3.6 ( Edgar, 2004 ). Aligned sequences were further revised by visual inspection, and regions with ambiguous alignment removed. Three concatenated datasets were assembled: (1) ‘123 n RT n ’ (subscript n denotes ‘nucleotide’) dataset consisting of 12 protein-coding, 2 rRNA and 22 tRNA genes (a total of 14,551 bp); (2) ‘12 n RT n ’ dataset consisting of the above genes with third codon positions of protein-coding genes removed (a total of 10,935 bp); (3) ‘12 n 3 r RT n ’ dataset consisting of the above genes using a ‘RY-coding’ (a total of 14,551 bp; subscript r denotes ‘RY-coding’) in which the third codon purines (A/G) were replaced by ‘R’ and third codon pyrimidines (C/T) with ‘Y’ for protein genes ( Phillips and Penny, 2003 ). In the actual operation, we arbitrarily used ‘A’ and ‘C’ instead of ‘R’ and ‘Y’, respectively following Saitoh et al. (2006) . For each of the three datasets, partitioned Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses were performed. Four (‘12 n RT n ’) or five partitions (‘123 n RT n ’ and ‘12 n 3 r RT n ’) were set as different codon positions of protein-coding genes, rRNA and tRNA. For Bayesian (BS) analyses, independent substitution models were selected for each partition in MrModeltest ver. 2.2 ( Nylander, 2004 ) following Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) except for third codon positions in the 12 n 3 r RT n dataset, where we set a single rate category (lset nst = 1). BS analyses were performed with MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 ( Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 ), with model parameters unlinked and rate multipliers variable across partitions. Markov chain Monte Carlo (10 million generations) was run for each dataset with every 1000 generations. Finally, we built the consensus tree after discarding the first 30% of trees as burn-in. Two independent runs were performed to examine congruence of results. Partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were implemented using a rapid-hill-climbing algorithm in RAxML ver. 7.0.4 ( Stamatakis, 2006 ). For each of the three datasets, we first performed ML inference with 100 replications under GTRMIX model to find the best-scoring ML tree. Then, a nonparametric bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications was conducted under GTRCAT model to evaluate node robustness of the ML tree."

Saitoh et al.

Within lineage ‘B’, monophyly of Argentiniformes, Esociformes, Stomiiformes and Salmoniformes is well supported (BS = 100% and PP = 100%), but Osmeriformes ( sensu Nelson, 2006 ) is revealed as polyphyletic. Esociformes and Salmoniformes show a sister taxon relationship, and they together represent the sister group of Argentiniformes with strong support (BS = 74–100% and PP = 100%). Four families, i.e., Osmeridae, Plecoglossidae, Retropinnidae and Salangidae, form a monophyletic group that represent the sister group of Stomiiformes with strong support (BS = 99–100% and PP = 100%).

Our results strongly support both hypotheses, as does another recent molecular study ( López et al., 2004 ) which showed that Retropinnidae + Osmeridae constitute a monophyletic group that is the sister group of Stomiiformes. Therefore, we have refined Osmeriformes to include only Retropinnidae, Osmeridae, Plecoglossidae, and Salangidae. We found that Galaxiidae comprises a monophyletic group that is only distantly related to the reconstituted Osmeriformes. Detailed analyses of molecular data based on intensive taxa sampling by Waters et al. (2000, 2002) of galaxiids, which Nelson (2006) placed within Osmeriformes, represent a monophyletic group that is the sister group of other orders together (Argentiniformes, Esociformes, Salmoniformes, Stomiiformes and Osmeriformes). Thus, with Retropinnidae and Lepidogalaxias removed, as outlined above, we suggest erection of an Order Galaxiiformes to Galaxias and allied genera. The position of Aplochiton and Lovettia , included in Aplochitonidae by McDowall (1969) but linked to Galaxias by Johnson and Patterson (1996) , remains to be determined within the context of the above classification."

All of these hypotheses of relationships were based largely on morphological characters and were based on the examination of a narrow range of potentially related fishes. Waters et al.

(2003) attempted to unravel relationships among basal euteleost fishes by examining DNA sequences of a broader range of genera, but did not examine Lepidogalaxias . Given all these divergent conclusions, determining relationships of Lepidogalaxias is of considerable interest and in our view can only be resolved by studying a broader range of lower euteleostean fishes than hitherto, which is our purpose here. Hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships should be examined within the context of modern higher-level classifications of teleostean fishes, which began with Greenwood et al. (1966) , who grouped teleostean fishes into three major divisions. Their division III or Euteleostei ( Greenwood et al., 1967 ), includes five superorders: Protacanthopterygii, Ostariophysi, Paracanthopterygii, Atherinomorpha, and Acanthopterygii. The composition of the euteleostean group has changed since its inception. Ostariophysi was removed from Euteleostei and placed in subdivision Otocephala by Lecointre and Nelson (1996) . Then Protacanthopterygii, within Euteleostei was limited to only Argentiniformes (Argentinoidei and Alepocephaloidei) and Salmoniformes (Salmonoidei and Osmeroidei), by Johnson and Patterson (1996) (see Fig. 1 a); all remaining euteleosts, apart from Esociformes, were combined in Neoteleostei ( Johnson, 1992 ). Using mitogenomic data, Alepocephaloidei and Sundasalangidae were removed from Euteleostei, and placed in subdivision Otocephala ( Ishiguro et al., 2003, 2005; Lavoué et al., 2008 ). Where Lepidogalaxias fits among these higher groups is a question of great interest. There is no general consensus on relationships among lower euteleosts, as summarized by Johnson and Patterson (1996) . Incongruence among morphology-based hypotheses has been attributed to difficulty in correctly coding and weighting of morphological characters (e.g. Waters et al., 2002; López et al., 2004 ). Molecular evidence provides another way of reconstructing interrelationships of these fishes ( Ishiguro et al., 2003 ). Three major molecule-based hypotheses ( Fig. 1 c–e) have consistently revealed sister-relationships between salmoniforms and esociforms ( Ishiguro et al., 2003; López et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008 ), despite their separation using morphological data ( Johnson and Patterson, 1996 ). However, disagreement persists about the positions of Argentiniformes and Osmeriformes, as indicated by three different molecular-based hypotheses ( Fig. 1 c–e). In addition, none of these molecular studies has included Lepidogalaxias . In this study, we extend the work of Ishiguro et al. (2003) , and include Lepidogalaxias in a study of lower euteleost relationships, adding eight new mitochondrial genomes. Our specific goals were to (1) evaluate the phylogenetic position of Lepidogalaxias , and (2) clarify interrelationships among lower euteleostean orders. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Taxon sampling and molecular data Mitochondrial genomes from 39 ingroup taxa and 17 outgroups ( Appendix A ) were used to reconstruct an ordinal level phylogeny of lower euteleosts. Among these, 48 mitogenomes were obtained from GenBank. Eight ingroup taxa from four families were newly determined to improve coverage of ‘osmeriform’ fishes, including (1) Galaxias gollumoides and G. sp. ‘southern’ (Galaxiidae) from New Zealand; (2) Lepidogalaxias salamandroides (Lepidogalaxiidae) from Western Australia; (3) Hypomesus nipponensis , Mallotus villosus and Osmerus mordax (Osmeridae) from China, and Canada; (4) Neosalanx anderssoni and Protosalanx chinensis (Salangidae) also from China. 2.2 Laboratory protocol Total genomic DNA was extracted from muscle tissues using E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Inc., Georgia, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Versatile fish primers and species-specific primers ( Appendix E ) were used to amplify contiguous and overlapping fragments of the whole mitogenome by PCR for each species. PCR products were purified in 1.5–2.0% Sea plaque agarose (FMC) and directly sequenced by using PCR primers or additional sequencing primers in an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). 2.3 Phylogenetic inference We conducted phylogenetic analyses broadly similar to those employed by Miya and colleagues (e.g. Ishiguro et al., 2005; Saitoh et al., 2006 ) in their analyses of mitogenomic data.

Aligned sequences were further revised by visual inspection, and regions with ambiguous alignment removed. Three concatenated datasets were assembled: (1) ‘123 n RT n ’ (subscript n denotes ‘nucleotide’) dataset consisting of 12 protein-coding, 2 rRNA and 22 tRNA genes (a total of 14,551 bp); (2) ‘12 n RT n ’ dataset consisting of the above genes with third codon positions of protein-coding genes removed (a total of 10,935 bp); (3) ‘12 n 3 r RT n ’ dataset consisting of the above genes using a ‘RY-coding’ (a total of 14,551 bp; subscript r denotes ‘RY-coding’) in which the third codon purines (A/G) were replaced by ‘R’ and third codon pyrimidines (C/T) with ‘Y’ for protein genes ( Phillips and Penny, 2003 ).

BS analyses were performed with MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 ( Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 ), with model parameters unlinked and rate multipliers variable across partitions.

For each of the three datasets, we first performed ML inference with 100 replications under GTRMIX model to find the best-scoring ML tree. Then, a nonparametric bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications was conducted under GTRCAT model to evaluate node robustness of the ML tree. 2.4 Topology test Statistical differences among alternative topologies were examined under the likelihood framework. First, site-wise log-likelihoods were calculated for alternative topologies using the -f g option in RAxML. Then, outputs were subjected to CONSEL ver. 0.1i ( Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 2001 ) to decide whether hypotheses with lower likelihood value should be rejected. Five tests were used to make a confident choice, including approximately unbiased test, bootstrap probability, Bayesian posterior probability, Kishino-Hasegawa test and Shimodaira-Hasegawa test. For each test, a p -value at 5% significance level represented rejection of the hypothesis. 3 Results 3.1 Mitogenome The eight newly determined mitochondrial genomes reported here (HM106487-106494) are consistent in gene composition and organization with generalized fish mitogenomes, i.e., comprising two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes and a control region. The size of these mitogenomes ranges from 16 506 bp in G. gollumoides to 16,899 bp in P. chinensis . 3.2 Phylogenetic inference Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BS) analyses of three datasets (12 n 3 r RT n , 12 n RT n and 123 n RT n ) yielded five alternative topologies ( Fig. 2 ; Appendix C ). Statistical comparisons among these topologies were under a likelihood framework ( Appendix B ). These results show that ML and BS analyses using the 12 n 3 r RT n dataset represent the most likely phylogeny based on difference in log-likelihood (Δln L ) and five types of likelihood-based tests. Saitoh et al. (2006) also found that the 12 n 3 r RT n dataset, using ‘RY-coding’ of the third codon positions for protein genes, yielded the most robust results likely as a result of a tradeoff between preserving third codon position information and avoiding transition saturation at those sites. Hereafter, we restrict the discussion to results based on the 12 n 3 r RT n dataset ( Fig. 2 ). Euteleostean fishes, minus Alepocephaliformes ( sensu Marshall, 1962 ), represent a monophyletic group with strong support [bootstrap (BP) 93% for ML and Bayesian posterior probability (PP) 100% for BS, Fig. 2 ]. ML and BS analyses further show that euteleosts can be divided into three major lineages: (1) the Lepidogalaxias lineage occupies a basal position in the euteleostean phylogeny with strong support (BP = 98% and PP = 100%); (2) lineage ‘B’, which includes Stomiiformes + Protacanthoptergygii ( sensu Nelson, 2006 ) minus Lepidogalaxias with strong support (BS = 87% and PP = 100%); and (3) the Neoteleostei ( sensu Nelson, 2006 ) excluding Stomiiformes with strong support (BS = 100% and PP = 100%). Within lineage ‘B’, monophyly of Argentiniformes, Esociformes, Stomiiformes and Salmoniformes is well supported (BS = 100% and PP = 100%), but Osmeriformes ( sensu Nelson, 2006 ) is revealed as polyphyletic. Esociformes and Salmoniformes show a sister taxon relationship, and they together represent the sister group of Argentiniformes with strong support (BS = 74–100% and PP = 100%). Four families, i.e., Osmeridae, Plecoglossidae, Retropinnidae and Salangidae, form a monophyletic group that represent the sister group of Stomiiformes with strong support (BS = 99–100% and PP = 100%). The galaxiid fishes are supported as a monophyletic group that occupies a basal position in lineage ‘B’ with strong support (BS = 99% and PP = 100%). 4 Discussion Our results do not agree with most of the recent major hypotheses for euteleostean interrelationships at the ordinal level ( Fig. 1 a–e). In addition, the monophyly of Neoteleostei ( sensu Johnson, 1992 ) minus Stomiiformes revealed in this study agrees with results reported in a previous molecular study ( Li et al., 2008 ). 4.1 Phylogenetic position of Lepidogalaxias The phylogenetic position of Lepidogalaxias has been disputed for many years, as discussed earlier. The first molecular study of relationships of Lepidogalaxias was by Waters et al. (2000) . They used mitochondrial DNA sequences and concluded that it is not a galaxiid, and were unable to reject a relationship to esocids ( Rosen, 1974 ), but again, Waters et al’s (2000) study reached no conclusions about its relationships because they did not include appropriate outgroups. Our paper provides a new perspective, suggesting that it represents the sister group of all remaining euteleosts. This distinctive result derives from our inclusion of a much broader range of taxa than has hitherto been examined. 4.2 Interrelationships among lower euteleostean orders The monophyly of Argentiniformes minus Alepocephaliformes supported by results in this study agrees with previous molecular studies (e.g. Ishiguro et al., 2003; Lavoué et al., 2008 ). Williams (1987) first reported a sister group relationship between Salmoniformes and Esociformes, a conclusion that was supported by recent morphological studies ( Arratia, 1997 ) and also by molecular studies ( Ishiguro et al., 2003; López et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008 ; this study). McDowall (1969) and Rosen (1974) proposed a close relationship between southern and northern smelts (Retropinnidae, Osmeridae, Plecoglossidae and Salangidae), whereas Weitzman (1967) suggested a close relationship between Stomiiformes and Osmeridae. Our results strongly support both hypotheses, as does another recent molecular study ( López et al., 2004 ) which showed that Retropinnidae + Osmeridae constitute a monophyletic group that is the sister group of Stomiiformes. Therefore, we have refined Osmeriformes to include only Retropinnidae, Osmeridae, Plecoglossidae, and Salangidae. We found that Galaxiidae comprises a monophyletic group that is only distantly related to the reconstituted Osmeriformes. Detailed analyses of molecular data based on intensive taxa sampling by Waters et al. (2000, 2002) of galaxiids, which Nelson (2006) placed within Osmeriformes, represent a monophyletic group that is the sister group of other orders together (Argentiniformes, Esociformes, Salmoniformes, Stomiiformes and Osmeriformes). Thus, with Retropinnidae and Lepidogalaxias removed, as outlined above, we suggest erection of an Order Galaxiiformes to Galaxias and allied genera. The position of Aplochiton and Lovettia , included in Aplochitonidae by McDowall (1969) but linked to Galaxias by Johnson and Patterson (1996) , remains to be determined within the context of the above classification.
