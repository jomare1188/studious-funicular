          "Over half of all birds are in the single order Passeriformes. This is a diverse group of species, comprising three orders of magnitude in body size variation, a broad array of feeding adaptations ranging from nectarivory to carnivory, a range of social systems from lekking to coloniality, and some of the most modest (e.g., tapaculos, Rhinocryptidae) and most spectacular (e.g., birds of paradise, Paradisaeidae) plumage displays found in birds. One major group within passerines—the oscines (Passeri)—is characterized by a significant learning component in the development of their vocal repertoire, and several oscine species (especially the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata ) have become models of vocal learning. Due to the impressive phenotypic variation in this species-rich group, many comparative studies of trait evolution have focused on passerines ( Gohli et al., 2013; Ricklefs, 2012; Rowe et al., 2013; Sol et al., 2010 ), making an understanding of their phylogenetic relationships a priority for systematists and comparative biologists.",
          "Early work on passerine monophyly and phylogeny has been reviewed elsewhere ( Barker, 2011; Barker et al., 2002 ), and is not addressed here. More recent work on inferring higher-level relationships in passerines, primarily using nuclear exon and intron data, has resolved many long-standing questions and overturned many previous hypotheses ( Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Ericson et al., 2002a; Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Irestedt et al., 2001; Johansson et al., 2008; Jønsson et al., 2008; Moyle et al., 2009, 2006; Tello et al., 2009 ). However, significant uncertainty remains, especially within the oscine passerines, or songbirds. Relationships of lineages in the region of transition between the ancestrally Australasian crow-like birds (core Corvoidea), and the primarily extra-Australasian Passerida, have been unresolved in some studies ( Barker et al., 2004 ), and may be affected by among-gene conflict ( Irestedt and Ohlson, 2008 ). Basal relationships within Passerida also remain unresolved with most data sets, despite fairly extensive taxon sampling and use of multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes ( Barker et al., 2004; Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Johansson et al., 2008 ). The resolving power of many of these studies is undoubtedly affected by the relatively small number (at most 5) of sampled loci, many of which are slowly-evolving nuclear genes, as well as by use of short fragments of rapidly-evolving mitochondrial DNA. Conversely, sampling a small number of passerines for a relatively large sample of nuclear genes has also failed to resolve basal passeridan relationships ( Hackett et al., 2008 ). More recent studies including hundreds or thousands of conserved loci ( Faircloth et al., 2012; McCormack et al., 2013 ) have yet to include enough passerines to establish the utility of these markers within the order.",
          "The work reported here focuses on testing the resolving power of a relatively underutilized source of data in avian phylogenetics—the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome)—in estimating passerine relationships. Mitogenomic data have been used widely in other animal groups at multiple hierarchical levels ( Douglas and Gower, 2010; Masta et al., 2009; Mayden et al., 2009; Simon and Hadrys, 2013; Zhang and Wake, 2009 ), but studies of birds have been fairly limited by comparison. Starting with the earliest work ( Härlid and Arnason, 1999; Mindell et al., 1999, 1997 ), most of this effort has been focused on ordinal relationships within birds ( Gibb et al., 2007; Haddrath and Baker, 2001; Harrison et al., 2004; Morgan-Richards et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 2010; Pratt et al., 2009; Slack et al., 2007, 2003, 2006 ). Unfortunately, the mitogenome’s effectiveness in recovering relationships among avian orders is mixed, and depends heavily on taxon sampling and methods of analysis ( Braun and Kimball, 2002 ). More recently, mitogenome data have been applied with apparently greater success to problems within more closely related groups of birds, such as families ( Krajewski et al., 2010; Lerner et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2013 ), and even genera ( Cerasale et al., 2012a ). A largely open question is how well such data would resolve relationships at intermediate taxonomic levels, such as among lineages within an order. Although two previous studies ( Marshall et al., 2013; Nabholz et al., 2010 ) have addressed passerine relationships using mitogenome data, both focused on a subset of the data (light strand protein-coding genes only), and both relied heavily on opportunistic sampling of available mitogenome data that were not collected with a comprehensive sampling of passerines in mind. Here, 15 new passerine mitogenome sequences selected primarily to address questions of relationships within the oscine passerines are reported. These data are analyzed in combination with published passerine mitogenomic data to determine their phylogenetic utility at the intraordinal level and to recover novel hypotheses of relationship within Passeriformes."

              "Other than a handful of studies of specific passerine groups ( Cerasale et al., 2012a; Lerner et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2013 ), relatively few passerine mitogenome sequences have been published to date. These include the three “suboscines” Acanthisitta , Smithornis and Cnemotriccus ( Harrison et al., 2004; Mindell et al., 1999; Slack et al., 2007 ; in quotes because this is a paraphyletic group, with Acanthisitta sister to all other passerines), two basal oscines ( Menura, Epthianura ; Cooke et al., 2012; Slack et al., 2007 ), several corvoids ( Oriolus , Lanius , Urocissa , Cyanopica , Pica , Podoces , Garrulus , Corvus , and Nucifraga ; Barker et al., in press; Härlid and Arnason, 1999; Ke et al., 2010; Qian et al., 2013c ; unpublished GenBank accessions HQ915867 , JN018413 , JN108020 , JQ083495 , JQ423932 ), and an assortment of Passerida and their close relatives ( Eopsaltria, Petroica, Vidua, Taeniopygia, Pseudopodoces, Alauda, Acrocephalus, Sylvia, Garrulax, Leiothrix, Pycnonotus, Campylorhynchus, Cyanoptila, Ficedula, Luscinia, Gracula, Sturnus, and Acridotheres ; Cooke et al., 2012; Mindell et al., 1998; Mossman et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2010; Barker et al., in press; Qian et al., 2013a,b ; unpublished GenBank accessions FJ378536 , GU475148 , HQ690246 , HQ896033 , HQ896037 , HQ915864 , HQ915865 , HQ915866 , JF810423 , JF937590 , JN018411 , JQ003191 , JQ348398 , JQ423933 ). This sampling is weak in suboscine representation, and fails to include a number of divergent oscine lineages whose placement with nuclear data is uncertain. For this reason, mitogenomes from three additional suboscines and 12 additional oscines ( Table 1 ) were obtained. The new suboscines represent major New World lineages, while the oscines include one basal meliphagoid lineage ( Malurus ), one clear but divergent corvoid ( Vireo ), several “transitional” lineages whose placement between corvoids and Passerida remains controversial ( Notiomystis , Oedistoma , Tregellasia , Picathartes ), and major lineages of Passerida ( Bombycilla , Poecile , Hyliota , Regulus , Sitta , and Turdus )."

              "Mitogenomes were sequenced and assembled using a range of methods that reflect evolving approaches to this problem ( Table 2 ). These methods include: (A) PCR and primer walking using Sanger sequencing, (B) long PCR followed by shotgun sequencing of PCR products using Sanger sequencing, and (C) whole genome shotgun sequencing using several combinations of Illumina library preparation and sequencing methods. Approach A has been outlined in detail elsewhere ( Powell et al., 2013 ), so here only the specific primers used in obtaining complete sequences from the three taxa sequenced in this manner are reported ( Supporting online Table 1 ). The experimental and informatics details of approach C have also been reported ( Barker et al., in press ). The only differences here were that a Nextera rather than TruSeq (both from Illumina, San Diego CA) library preparation was used for Lepidothrix due to limited input DNA (NB: of two attempts at whole genome amplification using Genomiphi [GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh PA], mitogenome assembly was successful in one and failed in a second) and that both MiSeq (150 bp paired-end; 0.6–12.8 × 10 6 reads per taxon) and HiSeq 2000 (100 bp paired-end; 19.9–25.5 × 10 6 reads per taxon) instruments were used to sequence the libraries.",
              "Approach B, used in obtaining sequences of Vireo and Bombycilla , was straightforward. First, specific long PCR primers located in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b genes were developed using sample-specific sequences of those genes obtained using universal primers ( Barker et al., 2008; Hebert et al., 2004 ). These specific primers ( Table 2 ) were then used to amplify the complete mitogenome in two fragments, using the Expand Long PCR kit (Roche Applied Science, Madison WI). Long PCR products were quantified fluorometrically, combined in equimolar concentrations, 3–25 μg sheared by 4 min of nebulization (Invitrogen #K7025-05, Carlsbad, CA) using N 2 at 30 psi, and recovered following the manufacturer’s directions. Recovered DNA fragments were repaired by incubation at 12 °C for 15 min with 3 μL T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs [NEB], Ipswich, MA) and 100 mM dNTPs in appropriate buffer. The reaction was halted by adding EDTA to 10 mM concentration and heating to 75 °C for 20 min to denature the polymerase. After purification with a QIAquick spin column (Qiagen, Valencia CA), repaired fragments were phosphorylated by incubation with 10 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and rATP following the manufacturer’s directions. Polished blunt-end fragments were ligated with 20 ng of Sma I-digested, dephosphorylated vector (Fermentas, Hanover MD) at a 4:1 insert: plasmid molar ratio, by incubation with 400 U of T4 DNA ligase (NEB) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The ligation mix was used to transform E. coli JM109 cells (Promega, Madison WI) following the manufacturer’s protocols, and colonies were amplified using M13 primers by colony PCR ( Woodman, 2008 ). PCR products were sized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ∼two 96-well plates of appropriately-sized products were sequenced in the forward direction using BigDye v3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems [ABI], Foster City, CA), electrophoresed on an ABI 3730XL at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center.",
              "Assembly and alignment .—For the two Sanger approaches (A and B), primers and vector (if any) were trimmed and sequences assembled using Sequencher v4.9 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor MI). Methods for assembly of the Illumina data used here have been described elsewhere ( Barker et al., in press ), but in short, low coverage whole genome shotgun sequence was assembled using Velvet ( Zerbino and Birney, 2008 ), mitogenome sequences identified, and incomplete sequences finished using PRICE ( Ruby et al., 2013 ) and/or Gapfiller ( Boetzer and Pirovano, 2012 ). Using Geneious ( Biomatters, 2013 ), reads were mapped back to the assembled consensus to evaluate levels and evenness of coverage, assess possible assembly artifacts (e.g., indels, violations of pairing orientation or expected pair distances), and guide end-trimming prior to gap filling. Assembled mitogenome contigs were rotated so as to begin at tRNA-Phe, then aligned against a reference mitogenome ( Taeniopygia , DQ422742) in Geneious , and gene boundaries annotated. Due to questions of homology within passerines ( Mindell et al., 1998; Singh et al., 2008 ), and the failure to completely assemble the control region and some flanking sequence from a number of genomic shotgun sequence data sets, mitogenomes were truncated after tRNA-Thr prior to alignment (thus excluding tRNA-Pro, ND6, tRNA-Glu and the control region from alignment and subsequent phylogenetic analyses). Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.6 ( Edgar, 2004 ), with default parameters."

              "The alignment obtained was analyzed using both unpartitioned and partitioned approaches, using both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. The data were partitioned using an optimal partitioning scheme selected by Partitionfinder v1.1.1 ( Lanfear et al., 2012 ): these analyses used a greedy search algorithm under the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978 ). Partitions were tested for variation in base composition using a χ 2 test of homogeneity, as implemented in PAUP * v4.0b10 ( Swofford, 2000 ). In order to explore the impact of indel-rich regions on phylogenetic analysis, analyses were performed after excluding sites from the alignment (filtering) using Gblocks v0.91 ( Castresana, 2000 ), with the minimum number of positions for a conserved position set at 50%, for a flanking position at 85%, a maximum of 8 contiguous non-conserved positions, a minimum block length of 4, and allowing up to 50% of taxa to have a gap at a given site. In order to ameliorate the effects of taxon-specific base compositional biases (see Results), as well as to reduce the impact of transitional relative to transversional substitutions, analyses were performed using AGY coding (a second type of filtering; Gibson et al., 2005 ). A detailed annotation of Agelaius , indicating the position of each gene, coding position, RNA paired and unpaired, and non-coding site ( Powell et al., 2013 ) was mapped onto the alignment to generate character sets corresponding to these features.",
              "All maximum likelihood analyses were performed in RAxML ( Stamatakis, 2006 ) either using v7.6.3 on XSEDE through the CIPRES Science Gateway ( Miller et al., 2010 ), or locally using v7.7.0. Searches for optimal trees were performed under the best fit model chosen by Partitionfinder , with 20 random starting trees. For each partitioning scheme and matrix (e.g., original alignment, Gblocks -filtered, AGY-filtered), non-parametric bootstrapping ( Felsenstein, 1985 ) was performed with 500 replicates, each starting from a single parsimony starting tree. Partitioned Bayesian analyses of the unfiltered matrix were performed in MrBayes v3.2.2 ( Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003 ) on a local cluster. Multiple 4-chain Metropolis-coupled analyses (with default heating) were run 2 × 10 7 generations, sampling every 1000. These analyses unlinked all substitution model parameters, with branch lengths constrained to proportionality. Appropriate burn-in, run convergence and parameter posteriors were assessed using Tracer v1.5 ( Rambaut and Drummond, 2004 ), and convergence of nodal posterior probabilities using AWTY ( Nylander et al., 2004 )."

              "Assemblies of three out of the five species sequenced using Sanger methods ( Table 3 ) were complete, while the remaining two were nearly so. The sequence of Bombycilla is missing 81 bases of ND5 in two short segments, 64 bases of CYTB, and part of the 3’ end of the control region, whereas the sequence of Hyliota is missing a substantial portion of the control region due to a repeat expansion in its 3’ end. Of the ten samples for which de novo mitogenome assembly from whole genome shotgun data was attempted, only four (all with the standard avian gene order) yielded complete mitogenomes ( Table 3 ), although partial mitogenome sequences covering the region from tRNA-Phe through tRNA-Thr (∼90% of the genome) were obtained from all species. These sequences have been submitted to GenBank (accessions KJ909186 – KJ909200 ). Velvet assemblies typically foundered in or near the control region, probably due to similarities between the functional and decaying control regions in species with the “remnant” configuration ( Singh et al., 2008 ), as well as heteroplasmy of repeat expansions in some species ( Mundy et al., 1996 ). Even coverage for the completely-assembled mitogenomes indicated that all had the “standard” gene order ( Gibb et al., 2007 ). MUSCLE alignment of the assembled and trimmed mitogenome sequences was straightforward, and yielded an alignment with relatively few gapped positions (1347 or 8.7%). This alignment has been deposited in TreeBASE ( http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S15907 ). Given the straightforward alignment, few (643 or 4%) gapped sites were filtered by a Gblocks analysis using the parameters described above, primarily in unpaired regions of RNA genes and intergenic spacers."

              "Analysis of the unfiltered alignment using Partitionfinder returned a fourteen partition model as the best fit ( Table 4 ). Partitions primarily recognized codon position of protein-coding genes (including three partitions each for most first, second, and third codon positions) and paired (helix) versus unpaired (non-helix) positions of ribosomal genes, with some protein-coding first codon position sites combined with the ribosomal genes ( Table 4 ). Partitions differed substantially in relative nucleotide substitution rates, base composition, among-site rate heterogeneity ( α ranging from 0.4 to 1.8), and proportion of invariant sites (from 1% to 76%). Rates of evolution also varied widely, ranging from 4.2 substitutions/site (partition 7, consisting of second positions of codons) to 115.5 substitutions/site (partition 14, consisting of third positions of codons). Of these fourteen partitions, the three consisting entirely of codon third positions all deviated significantly from base compositional homogeneity as judged by the (generally conservative) χ 2 contingency test (all values >1300, p < 0.0001). To explore this pattern further, third position base frequencies were plotted by taxon, sorting by the proportion of cytosine (per Gibson et al., 2005 ). This qualitative analysis ( Fig. 1 ) strongly indicated that while the proportion of guanine was constant and low, the proportion of cytosine ranged widely (from ∼0.35 to 0.5), and was strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of thymine (and to a lesser extent adenine). This is reflected in the strong negative correlation (Pearson’s r = −0.8) of C and T frequencies among species which was higher than all other among-base correlations. This analysis provides strong a priori justification for use of methods that do not assume stationarity ( Boussau and Gouy, 2006; Foster, 2004; Gowri-Shankar and Jow, 2006 ), or filtering of the data to remove C–T transitional differences (AGY-filtering), as suggested by Gibson et al. (2005) for ordinal sampling of mammal mitogenomes. Due to computational limitations of non-stationary methods in handling large matrices, this study focuses on the latter approach."

              "Phylogenetic analyses of the mitogenome data generally yielded fully-resolved, well-supported hypotheses of relationship. However, the specific topologies obtained and the support measures for inferred relationships varied to some degree among analyses (e.g., partitioning and filtering of data, see Fig. 2 ), including at some nodes of interest. Three of six ML analyses yielded the same topology ( Fig. 2 A), whereas the remaining three yielded topologies ( Fig. 2 B–D) that differed slightly, primarily in the arrangement of Oedistoma , Notiomystis , and the Petroicidae at a deeper level, and of Hyliota , Poecile , Alauda and Bombycilla + Regulus at a more recent level. In addition to these topological differences, support for some relationships varied extensively among analyses, while other results were robust to analytical details ( Fig. 2 , Table 5 ). Individual analyses varied in overall support, ranging from 78% to 87% of nodes (out of a maximum of 122) receiving ⩾75% bootstrap support. In general, unpartitioned, unfiltered analyses yielded higher nodal support values than corresponding partitioned or filtered approaches, both in terms of overall support and for specific relationships ( Fig. 3 ). A partitioned Bayesian analysis of the unfiltered matrix yielded a maximum clade credibility tree with relationships as in Fig. 2 D. As is typically found in comparisons of Bayesian posteriors and non-parametric bootstraps, nodal support for most relationships was higher than in corresponding ML analyses, with only eight nodes receiving estimated posterior probabilities <0.95. Given the non-stationarity described above, and the critical importance of partitioning in properly describing mitogenome sequence evolution ( Krajewski et al., 2010; Powell et al., 2013 ), the partitioned, AGY-filtered analysis is arguably the best representation of these data ( Fig. 4 ). One apparent artifact in these analyses regarded placement of a GenBank sequence (accession HM535648 ) labeled Pseudopodoces (Hume’s ground tit), which fell inside of a clade otherwise including members of the family Muscicapidae. This specimen is clearly mislabelled, as this genus is indisputably a highly-derived corvid-like member of the Paridae ( James et al., 2003 ), and the true parid sequenced here is more closely related to the sylvioid passerines, as expected: the discussion below assumes that the “ Pseudopodoces ” sequence is an unidentified muscicapid. Other specific relationships recovered in these analyses are discussed in detail below."

With regard to previously-established relationships, these data strongly support the following clades ( Figs. 2 and 4 ): (1) a basal split between Tyranni and oscines ( Barker et al., 2002; Ericson et al., 2002a; Hackett et al., 2008 ); (2) monophyly of New World subscines to the exclusion of the Old World subscines (represented here only by Smithornis ; Barker et al., 2002; Ericson et al., 2002a; Hackett et al., 2008 ); (3) a basal split between the lyrebird Menura and all other oscines ( Barker et al., 2002; Ericson et al., 2002b; Hackett et al., 2008 ); (4) a subsequent split between Meliphagoids ( Malurus and Ephthianura ) and the remaining oscines (except Menura and the Ptilonorhynchidae + Climacteridae, the latter unsampled here; Barker et al., 2002; Hackett et al., 2008 ); and (5) a clade containing two major groups corresponding to the “core Corvoidea” ( Barker et al., 2004 ) on the one hand and the Passerida ( sensu stricto , Barker et al., 2004 ) and its closest relatives ( Oedistoma , Notiomystis , Petroicidae , and Picathartes ) on the other ( Aggerbeck et al., 2014; Barker et al., 2004; Treplin et al., 2008 ). Within these major groupings, the mitogenomic data also corroborate a number of previously-established relationships, including: (1) monophyletic Furnariida and Tyrannida ( sensu Ericson et al., 2002b ) within the suboscines ( Barker et al., 2002; Hackett et al., 2008; Irestedt et al., 2001; Treplin et al., 2008 ), (2) a clade including Laniidae and Corvidae to the exclusion of Vireo and Oriolus ( Aggerbeck et al., 2014; Barker et al., 2004 ), (3) association of Old World warblers ( Acrocephalus ), babblers ( Sylvia , Garrulax , and Leiothrix ), bulbuls ( Pycnonotus ), and swallows ( Tachycineta ) in a clade of Sylvioidea ( Alström et al., 2005; Barker et al., 2002; Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Fregin et al., 2012; Johansson et al., 2008; Treplin et al., 2008 ), (4) monophyly of a clade of finch-like birds roughly corresponding to the Passeroidea ( Barker et al., 2002; Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Johansson et al., 2008; Treplin et al., 2008 ), (5) within passeroids, a sequence of splits between Estrildidae, Passeridae, and Fringillidae + New World nine-primaried oscines ( Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Treplin et al., 2008 ), (6) monophyly of a clade of thrush-like birds in a clade of Muscicapoidea ( Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Cibois and Cracraft, 2004; Johansson et al., 2008; Treplin et al., 2008 ), and (7) a basal split within muscicapoids between starlings and thrushes, and a split within thrushes between typical thrushes (Turdidae) and flycatchers, chats and allies (Muscicapidae; Cibois and Cracraft, 2004; Sangster et al., 2010; Treplin et al., 2008; Zuccon et al., 2006 )."

              "As noted above, these data also resolve some passerine relationships that have remained unresolved in previous studies, or that have proven controversial because of differences in taxon or gene sampling. One of these areas involves relationships among the core Corvoidea, the Passerida ( sensu stricto , excluding taxa such as Irenidae that were clearly misplaced in early DNA hybridization studies), and deeply-divergent “transitional” groups including the Cnemophilidae, Melanocharitidae, Notiomystidae, Callaeidae, Petroicidae, and Picathartidae. Previous studies have varied in the placement of these taxa, as well as the strength of support for their placement. The earliest evidence for their relationships came from nuclear DNA sequence studies, including that of Barker et al. (2002) that showed (without sampling Petroicidae) moderate support for Picathartidae as sister of the Passerida, and that of Ericson et al. (2002b) that very weakly supported Petroicidae (represented by Eopsaltria ) as the sister to Passerida (without having sampled Picathartidae). A subsequent study of Passerida by Ericson and Johansson (2003) sampled both Picathartidae and Petroicidae, but found the former most closely related to Passerida (and included it in that clade, based on the presence of a shared indel in c- myc ). Although included, placement of Petroicidae in that study relative to Passerida was not presented. Barker et al.’s (2004) study of RAG exons found Petroicidae and Picathartidae as sequential sister taxa to the Passerida, although this relationship was only strongly supported in Bayesian analyses, and neither Bayesian nor ML analyses significantly favored Petroicidae or Picathartidae as sister to Passerida. The same study found weak support for a monophyletic grouping of Cnemophilidae, Callaeidae and Melanocharitidae, with this clade in turn sister to the core Corvoidea. Placement of this group of families was only strongly supported in Bayesian analysis, and its monophyly was not strongly supported by any analysis. A subsequent study by Jonsson et al. (2007) based on three nuclear introns also recovered Picathartidae and Petroicidae as the closest relatives to Passerida, although this study found the two families to be sister taxa (with weak Bayesian support). This much smaller study did not sample the other groups listed above. The only other study to sample these transitional groups as thoroughly as Barker et al. (2004) was that of Irestedt and Ohlson (2008) , which sampled both RAG exons as well as three additional introns (from MB, GAPDH, and ODC). Their preferred analysis (that excluded RAG1 data) yielded a topology with all of these transitional taxa in a grade leading to the crown Passerida. However, placement of the Melanocharitidae in this grade was only weakly supported (even in Bayesian analysis), and inclusion of RAG1 data favored its placement with the core Corvoidea. Among the remaining taxa, their analysis failed to resolve relationships robustly, except for demonstrating that the Cnemophilidae were the most distantly related to Passerida.",
              "The current study strongly supports placement of Melanocharitidae, Notiomystidae, Petroicidae, and Picathartidae in a grade leading to a generally well-supported monophyletic Passerida. At the moment, the mitochondrial placement of Cnemophilidae and Callaeidae is unknown, but the latter at least should fall out as sister to Notiomystidae based on analyses of nuclear DNA ( Driskell et al., 2007; Ewen et al., 2006 ). Relationships among the sampled transitional taxa vary somewhat by analysis, as does support for specific relationships. All of the analyses place Picathartes sister to the Passerida, in agreement with the c- myc indel and intron data ( Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Irestedt and Ohlson, 2008 ). Either Petroicidae ( Fig. 2 A and D) or Petroicidae + Notiomystidae ( Fig. 2 B and C) appear as the next closest relative to Picathartidae + Passerida. However, support for relationships among these taxa and Oedistoma (Melanocharitidae) is poor. It is possible that these relationships might be stabilized by inclusion of representative Cnemophilidae and Callaeidae, as well as increased sampling of Melanocharitidae, Petroicidae, and Picathartidae."

              "The other region of the tree where the mitogenome data offer resolution is at the base of the Passerida. Relationships among basal passeridan lineages have proven difficult to resolve, despite several studies with reasonable taxon sampling and multilocus sequence data. Barker et al. (2002, 2004) recovered clades roughly corresponding to Sibley and Ahlquist’s superfamilies Muscicapoidea, Sylvioidea and Passeroidea, although a number of genera or families fell outside their presumptive core groups (e.g., Alaudidae with Sylvioidea, Promeropidae with the Passeroidea). Those studies also identified a number of deeply-diverging lineages whose affinity was unclear, including the Bombycillidae, Regulidae, Paridae, Stenostiridae, and the so-called Certhioidea (the creepers, wrens, and allies). Unfortunately, the RAG data largely failed to resolve relationships among the major groups of Passerida and these deeply-divergent lineages. This lack of resolution was reinforced by concurrent and subsequent studies, such as those of Ericson and Johansson (2003 ; based on RAG1, c- myc , MB, and mitochondrial cytochrome b ), which represented passeridan relationships as a six-way polytomy, Fuchs et al. (2006; based on mitochondrial ND2 and nuclear MB intron) , Johansson et al. (2008 , based on MB, ODC, and FGB introns), and Treplin et al. (2008 ; based on the nuclear protein-coding genes RAG1, RAG2, ZENK, and c- myc ), the latter three yielding little better resolution than Ericson et al.’s polytomy. One notable result of the Fuchs et al. and Johansson et al. studies was identification of the presumptive sylvioid genus Hyliota as another deeply-diverging member of the Passerida with unclear affinities. Finally, two previous mitogenome studies have suggested resolution of passeridan relationships. One study ( Nabholz et al., 2010 ) analyzed mitochondrial transcriptome data from four species ( Parus , Muscicapa , Pipra , and Corvus ), in the context of eleven other passerine mitogenomes. That study found significant variation in basal passeridan relationships among analytical approaches, with some analyses showing strong support for a sylvioid + passeroid relationship, and others not. In their favored hypothesis, sylvioids and passeroids were sister to the parids, with Muscicapa sister to all other Passerida; however, the relationship of Parus with sylvioids and passeroids was only supported in one partitioned Bayesian analysis, with negligible support in other analyses. In the other study, Marshall et al. (2013) sequenced four mitogenomes from the finch species Fringilla coelebs , and analyzed them in the context of 29 passerine mitogenomes, making it the next most comprehensive passerine mitogenome study before this. Their codon-model Bayesian analysis of protein-coding genes strongly supported only a sister-group relationship between muscicapoids and passeroids, with sylvioids sister to both, contradicting Nabholz et al.’s results.",
              "The much more comprehensively-sampled mitogenome data analyzed here greatly improve our understanding of basal passeridan relationships, consistently pointing to a split between a clade of sylvioids, Hyliota , and Poecile on the one hand, and a strongly-supported clade comprising the Passeroidea, Muscicapoidea, Certhioidea, Bombycilla , and Regulus on the other ( Fig. 2 , node I; Fig. 4 ). This arrangement is similar to that obtained by Marshall et al., although that study did not include many of the deeply divergent passeridan taxa (Certhioidea, Bombycilla , Regulus , Poecile , or Hyliota ). Within the passeroid + muscicapoid clade, a sister-group relationship between Certhioidea and Muscicapoidea is universally recovered and generally well supported, though support drops as low as 42% in the partitioned analysis of the AGY-filtered matrix ( Fig. 2 , Table 5 ). These analyses also universally recover a sister group relationship between Bombycilla and Regulus , but support for this relationship is only strong in the unfiltered and Gblocks -filtered analyses, vanishing in the AGY-filtered analyses ( Fig. 2 , node L; Table 5 ). This suggests that base compositional biases likely play a role in attracting these two taxa, and indeed Bombycilla has the second-highest and Regulus the 13th highest C content at protein-coding third positions (most of the remaining C-rich taxa are suboscines and corvoids). Five out of six analyses place this pair as sister to Certhioidea + Muscicapoidea, but this is almost never well supported ( Fig. 2 , node J, Table 5 ). The Regulus + Bombycilla relationship is almost entirely novel, the exceptions being the parsimony analysis of Treplin et al. ( Treplin et al., 2008 ), which recovered the same grouping with 60% bootstrap, and the extensive gene sampling of Hackett et al. (2008) , which found the same grouping with 54% bootstrap support.",
              "The other major grouping within Passerida includes the Sylvioidea, Poecile , and Hyliota ( Fig. 2 , node F; Fig. 4 ). This clade receives moderate support from filtered and partitioned analyses, and is only weakly supported by the unfiltered, unpartitioned analysis. Relationships within this group are not well resolved. As currently delineated based on nuclear sequence data ( Alström et al., 2005; Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Fregin et al., 2012 ), Sylvioidea should include the larks (Alaudidae), but the mitogenome data are equivocal on this relationship, with only three out of six analyses recovering it, none with appreciable support ( Fig. 2 , node Q, Table 5 ). However, all the remaining sylvioids sampled do form a well-supported monophyletic group that is referred to here as the “core Sylvioidea”. Two other groups, the Paridae (represented by Poecile ) and Hyliota , appear either as sister taxa (3/6 ML analyses), or together in a clade with Alauda (with the latter sister to Poecile ), with all three sister to the core Sylvioidea. None of these alternative arrangements receive appreciable support. Additional sampling of deeply-divergent lineages that do or may fall in this region of the tree (e.g., Remiz , Stenostiridae, other larks) could help to stabilize these relationships.",
              "In summary, the mitogenomic data generally perform well in recovering passerine relationships at multiple hierarchical levels. Basal passerine relationships, including relationships among the suboscines and early-branching oscines such as the Menuroidea, Meliphagoidea, Corvoidea and Passerida and allies are strongly supported and congruent with robust results derived from multiple nuclear loci. These data strongly corroborate recent results regarding the placement of “transitional” forms most closely related to Passerida (e.g., Notiomystis , Petroicidae , Picathartes ), and better them by strongly supporting the placement of Oedistoma in this grade. Finally, the passerine mitogenome data for the first time resolve basal relationships among Passerida with respectable support. Although additional deeply-diverging lineages remain to be sampled in Passerida (e.g., Cnemophilidae, Stenostiridae, Promeropidae), these results are extremely encouraging regarding the future utility of mitogenome data in passerine phylogenetics."

            "paragraphs": [
              "Both hypotheses of passerine phylogenetic relationships ( Fig. 2 ) and nodal support ( Table 5 , Figs. 3 and 4 ) varied significantly with analytical approach. Perhaps surprisingly, partitioned analyses yielded lower support values for relationships at all levels of support (compare “Unpartitioned” and “Partitionfinder” panels in Fig. 3 ). This result, noted previously in an analysis of icterid mitogenomes (a subset of the current data), suggests that unpartitioned analysis overestimates support for many phylogenetic relationships. The most likely explanation for this is long branch attraction ( Felsenstein, 1978 ). Since support for many relationships goes down slightly without changing the topology (see the upper right hand corner of many panels in Fig. 3 ), these trees may be in the so-called “Farris zone” ( Siddall, 1998 ) for at least some sites, where methods like parsimony or underparameterized likelihood might be biased in favor of “true” relationships ( Swofford et al., 2001 ). This underscores the need to adequately address heterogeneity in partition-specific evolutionary dynamics.",
              "The effect of filtering the data generally depended on whether the data were analyzed using partitioning or not. Without partitioning, Gblocks filtering slightly reduced support overall, changing very few relationships, whereas once partitioning was applied, Gblocks filtering had essentially no additional effect ( Fig. 3 ). This suggests that many of the sites filtered by Gblocks (i.e., spacers, some unpaired RNA sites) have significantly different evolutionary dynamics from the remaining data, but these differences are adequately addressed by partitioning rather than exclusion. For this reason, at this level of comparison Gblocks filtering does not appear warranted. The effects of AGY filtering were also context dependent, being much stronger in the unpartitioned than in partitioned analyses ( Fig. 3 ). In the former, AGY filtering strongly reduced overall support values, whereas in the latter it had very little effect above and beyond that of partitioning, although specific relationships were impacted by AGY filtering in a complex pattern. For example, on the one hand monophyly of the Passerida ( Table 5 , node D)—a clade strongly corroborated by nuclear data ( Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Ericson et al., 2002a; Hackett et al., 2008 )—was more strongly supported by the AGY-filtered than the unfiltered analysis without partitioning. On the other hand, unpartitioned and partitioned AGY-filtered analyses strongly reduced support for a Bombycilla + Regulus clade ( Table 5 , node L), although neither recovered an alternative relationship. Since the latter result may be caused (or at least artificially strengthened) by base compositional biases (see above), this should be seen in a positive light. Overall, the benefits of AGY filtering seem mixed. Although not shown here, combination of partitioning, Gblocks -filtering, and AGY coding does not appear to offer additional benefits, yielding results essentially the same as partitioned AGY-filtered analyses. Partitioning by itself seems to compensate for many of the effects addressed by the filtering strategies used here (e.g., saturation); however, it cannot address the issue of non-stationarity posed by these data."

            "paragraphs": [
              "The use of mitogenomic data in inferring higher-level avian relationships has a somewhat checkered past. The earliest studies of complete avian mitogenomes (e.g., Mindell et al., 1999, 1997 ) yielded hypotheses of relationship strongly at odds with traditional notions of avian phylogeny, perhaps most notably placing the root of the avian tree between one or more Passeriformes and all other birds. Improved analytical approaches and increased taxon sampling have gone a long way to ameliorating such artifacts ( Braun and Kimball, 2002; Pratt et al., 2009 ). Even so, other than ordinal monophyly (with some notable exceptions) and some interordinal relationships (e.g., the Paleognath/Neognath split, the Galloanserae/Neoavian split, a clade of flamingos and grebes), higher-level relationships among birds remain largely unresolved with mitogenome data. To be fair, this does not appear to be entirely due to limitations of mtDNA, since multilocus nuclear data sets largely fail to resolve parts of the avian tree that are also unresolved by mitogenomes (e.g., basal relationships among Neoaves; Faircloth et al., 2012; Hackett et al., 2008; McCormack et al., 2013 ). By contrast, more recent mitogenome studies focusing on specific avian groups ( Cerasale et al., 2012b; Krajewski et al., 2010; Lerner et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2013 ) have proven far more successful, yielding fully resolved and generally well-supported hypotheses of relationship.",
              "The current study falls somewhere on the border between these two extremes. That is, mitogenome sequences perform relatively well in recovering relationships among passerine families, resolving a number of both deep and recent nodes that are strongly corroborated by nuclear data as well as supporting novel relationships that have not been resolved with any certainty until now ( Figs. 2 and 4 ; Table 5 ). On the other hand, some relationships (or nodal support values) vary with analytical approach, particularly along the grade leading to Passerida, and to some degree within Passerida as well. At least two factors are probably at play in the performance of mitogenome data in the current study. First, the taxon sampling here was focused more on deeply-diverging Passerida and allies than deeper in the tree. This may have artifically inflated resolution outside of these focal taxa. Second, the data analyzed here appear to span a range of divergences where saturation may begin to significantly impact accurate tree reconstruction.",
              "Evidence for saturation comes from comparison of mitgenome divergence to much more slowly-evolving nuclear loci. Fig. 5 shows a scatterplot of protein-coding gene divergence by codon position, as a function of divergence at the nuclear locus RAG1. This analysis is based on published RAG1 sequences for all genera in the mitogenome data set that had matching data. Third position transition divergences are clearly overprinting by ∼2% divergence in RAG1, somewhere at the level of intra-familial divergences in Fringillidae and Icteridae. By contrast, all first and second position changes, third position transversions, and all non-coding substitutions ( Supplementary online Fig. 2 ) evolve much more linearly, suggesting that they may perform similarly to nuclear loci within Passeriformes. As noted above, due primarily to issues of non-stationarity, the passerine mitogenome data were analyzed using AGY coding or filtering, which coincidentally eliminates C–T transitions from consideration. Perhaps unexpectedly given the high rate of third position transitions, AGY-filtering had the effect of reducing overall support (especially in the unpartitioned analysis, Fig. 3 ). By contrast, the AGY analyses strengthened a few specific relationships (e.g., node C in the unpartitioned analyses, node D in the partitioned), whose support may have been underestimated due to saturation effects. Ordinal-level studies of mitogenome data have favored RY-coding (elimination of both C–T and A–G transitions), due both to base compositional and sequence saturation concerns ( Morgan-Richards et al., 2008; Pratt et al., 2009; Slack et al., 2007 ). RY-coding was also applied to these data, but the results of those analyses (not shown) were quite similar to AGY-filtering, likely because the majority of third position transitions will be C–T, given the low stationary frequency of third position guanine. Overall, there is little evidence of the benefits of AGY-filtering from the perspective of transitional saturation within passerines. However, this approach will continue to be important in analysis of passerine mitogenomes due to the problem of non-stationarity (i.e. among-taxon variance in C and T frequencies), especially since available non-stationary likelihood and Bayesian methods are limited in their ability to perform thorough searches ( Boussau and Gouy, 2006 ) or to deal with large numbers of taxa ( Foster, 2004; Gowri-Shankar and Jow, 2006 ).",
              "The variance in topology and support among analytical approaches (e.g., types of filtering) introduces some ambiguity in interpretation of the mitogenome data. Some of this ambiguity might be eliminated by further increases in taxon sampling, especially given the high levels of divergence observed within passerines ( Graybeal, 1998; Hedtke et al., 2006; Hillis et al., 2003; Poe, 1998; Pollock et al., 2002; Zwickl and Hillis, 2002 ; but see Kim, 1996; Poe and Swofford, 1999; Rosenberg and Kumar, 2001, 2003 ). Future passerine mitogenome studies should focus on sampling deep splits within the major groups sampled here, in the hope that they will help resolve homoplasious changes and stabilize among-group relationships. However, it is possible that even with extensive sampling, passerine mitogenomic data will not be adequate to recover some deeper aspects of passerine phylogeny, and the issue of base compositional heterogeneity cannot be ignored. As importantly, mitogenome data represent a single genetic locus, and it must be borne in mind that horizontal gene transfer by hybridization may mislead interpretation of phylogenies generated from them (e.g., Hailer et al., 2012; Reid et al., 2012 ). Even so, judging from the results presented here inclusion of properly-analyzed mitogenomes along with other sources of data in a comprehensive approach to passerine phylogeny is likely to be beneficial."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Over half of all birds are in the single order Passeriformes. This is a diverse group of species, comprising three orders of magnitude in body size variation, a broad array of feeding adaptations ranging from nectarivory to carnivory, a range of social systems from lekking to coloniality, and some of the most modest (e.g., tapaculos, Rhinocryptidae) and most spectacular (e.g., birds of paradise, Paradisaeidae) plumage displays found in birds. One major group within passerines—the oscines (Passeri)—is characterized by a significant learning component in the development of their vocal repertoire, and several oscine species (especially the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata ) have become models of vocal learning. Due to the impressive phenotypic variation in this species-rich group, many comparative studies of trait evolution have focused on passerines ( Gohli et al., 2013; Ricklefs, 2012; Rowe et al., 2013; Sol et al., 2010 ), making an understanding of their phylogenetic relationships a priority for systematists and comparative biologists. Early work on passerine monophyly and phylogeny has been reviewed elsewhere ( Barker, 2011; Barker et al., 2002 ), and is not addressed here. More recent work on inferring higher-level relationships in passerines, primarily using nuclear exon and intron data, has resolved many long-standing questions and overturned many previous hypotheses ( Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Ericson et al., 2002a; Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Irestedt et al., 2001; Johansson et al., 2008; Jønsson et al., 2008; Moyle et al., 2009, 2006; Tello et al., 2009 ). However, significant uncertainty remains, especially within the oscine passerines, or songbirds. Relationships of lineages in the region of transition between the ancestrally Australasian crow-like birds (core Corvoidea), and the primarily extra-Australasian Passerida, have been unresolved in some studies ( Barker et al., 2004 ), and may be affected by among-gene conflict ( Irestedt and Ohlson, 2008 ). Basal relationships within Passerida also remain unresolved with most data sets, despite fairly extensive taxon sampling and use of multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes ( Barker et al., 2004; Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Johansson et al., 2008 ). The resolving power of many of these studies is undoubtedly affected by the relatively small number (at most 5) of sampled loci, many of which are slowly-evolving nuclear genes, as well as by use of short fragments of rapidly-evolving mitochondrial DNA. Conversely, sampling a small number of passerines for a relatively large sample of nuclear genes has also failed to resolve basal passeridan relationships ( Hackett et al., 2008 ). More recent studies including hundreds or thousands of conserved loci ( Faircloth et al., 2012; McCormack et al., 2013 ) have yet to include enough passerines to establish the utility of these markers within the order. The work reported here focuses on testing the resolving power of a relatively underutilized source of data in avian phylogenetics—the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome)—in estimating passerine relationships. Mitogenomic data have been used widely in other animal groups at multiple hierarchical levels ( Douglas and Gower, 2010; Masta et al., 2009; Mayden et al., 2009; Simon and Hadrys, 2013; Zhang and Wake, 2009 ), but studies of birds have been fairly limited by comparison. Starting with the earliest work ( Härlid and Arnason, 1999; Mindell et al., 1999, 1997 ), most of this effort has been focused on ordinal relationships within birds ( Gibb et al., 2007; Haddrath and Baker, 2001; Harrison et al., 2004; Morgan-Richards et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 2010; Pratt et al., 2009; Slack et al., 2007, 2003, 2006 ). Unfortunately, the mitogenome’s effectiveness in recovering relationships among avian orders is mixed, and depends heavily on taxon sampling and methods of analysis ( Braun and Kimball, 2002 ). More recently, mitogenome data have been applied with apparently greater success to problems within more closely related groups of birds, such as families ( Krajewski et al., 2010; Lerner et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2013 ), and even genera ( Cerasale et al., 2012a ). A largely open question is how well such data would resolve relationships at intermediate taxonomic levels, such as among lineages within an order. Although two previous studies ( Marshall et al., 2013; Nabholz et al., 2010 ) have addressed passerine relationships using mitogenome data, both focused on a subset of the data (light strand protein-coding genes only), and both relied heavily on opportunistic sampling of available mitogenome data that were not collected with a comprehensive sampling of passerines in mind. Here, 15 new passerine mitogenome sequences selected primarily to address questions of relationships within the oscine passerines are reported. These data are analyzed in combination with published passerine mitogenomic data to determine their phylogenetic utility at the intraordinal level and to recover novel hypotheses of relationship within Passeriformes. 2 Methods 2.1 Taxon sampling Other than a handful of studies of specific passerine groups ( Cerasale et al., 2012a; Lerner et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2013 ), relatively few passerine mitogenome sequences have been published to date. These include the three “suboscines” Acanthisitta , Smithornis and Cnemotriccus ( Harrison et al., 2004; Mindell et al., 1999; Slack et al., 2007 ; in quotes because this is a paraphyletic group, with Acanthisitta sister to all other passerines), two basal oscines ( Menura, Epthianura ; Cooke et al., 2012; Slack et al., 2007 ), several corvoids ( Oriolus , Lanius , Urocissa , Cyanopica , Pica , Podoces , Garrulus , Corvus , and Nucifraga ; Barker et al., in press; Härlid and Arnason, 1999; Ke et al., 2010; Qian et al., 2013c ; unpublished GenBank accessions HQ915867 , JN018413 , JN108020 , JQ083495 , JQ423932 ), and an assortment of Passerida and their close relatives ( Eopsaltria, Petroica, Vidua, Taeniopygia, Pseudopodoces, Alauda, Acrocephalus, Sylvia, Garrulax, Leiothrix, Pycnonotus, Campylorhynchus, Cyanoptila, Ficedula, Luscinia, Gracula, Sturnus, and Acridotheres ; Cooke et al., 2012; Mindell et al., 1998; Mossman et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2010; Barker et al., in press; Qian et al., 2013a,b ; unpublished GenBank accessions FJ378536 , GU475148 , HQ690246 , HQ896033 , HQ896037 , HQ915864 , HQ915865 , HQ915866 , JF810423 , JF937590 , JN018411 , JQ003191 , JQ348398 , JQ423933 ). This sampling is weak in suboscine representation, and fails to include a number of divergent oscine lineages whose placement with nuclear data is uncertain. For this reason, mitogenomes from three additional suboscines and 12 additional oscines ( Table 1 ) were obtained. The new suboscines represent major New World lineages, while the oscines include one basal meliphagoid lineage ( Malurus ), one clear but divergent corvoid ( Vireo ), several “transitional” lineages whose placement between corvoids and Passerida remains controversial ( Notiomystis , Oedistoma , Tregellasia , Picathartes ), and major lineages of Passerida ( Bombycilla , Poecile , Hyliota , Regulus , Sitta , and Turdus ). 2.2 Mitogenome sequencing Mitogenomes were sequenced and assembled using a range of methods that reflect evolving approaches to this problem ( Table 2 ). These methods include: (A) PCR and primer walking using Sanger sequencing, (B) long PCR followed by shotgun sequencing of PCR products using Sanger sequencing, and (C) whole genome shotgun sequencing using several combinations of Illumina library preparation and sequencing methods. Approach A has been outlined in detail elsewhere ( Powell et al., 2013 ), so here only the specific primers used in obtaining complete sequences from the three taxa sequenced in this manner are reported ( Supporting online Table 1 ). The experimental and informatics details of approach C have also been reported ( Barker et al., in press ). The only differences here were that a Nextera rather than TruSeq (both from Illumina, San Diego CA) library preparation was used for Lepidothrix due to limited input DNA (NB: of two attempts at whole genome amplification using Genomiphi [GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh PA], mitogenome assembly was successful in one and failed in a second) and that both MiSeq (150 bp paired-end; 0.6–12.8 × 10 6 reads per taxon) and HiSeq 2000 (100 bp paired-end; 19.9–25.5 × 10 6 reads per taxon) instruments were used to sequence the libraries. Approach B, used in obtaining sequences of Vireo and Bombycilla , was straightforward. First, specific long PCR primers located in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b genes were developed using sample-specific sequences of those genes obtained using universal primers ( Barker et al., 2008; Hebert et al., 2004 ). These specific primers ( Table 2 ) were then used to amplify the complete mitogenome in two fragments, using the Expand Long PCR kit (Roche Applied Science, Madison WI). Long PCR products were quantified fluorometrically, combined in equimolar concentrations, 3–25 μg sheared by 4 min of nebulization (Invitrogen #K7025-05, Carlsbad, CA) using N 2 at 30 psi, and recovered following the manufacturer’s directions. Recovered DNA fragments were repaired by incubation at 12 °C for 15 min with 3 μL T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs [NEB], Ipswich, MA) and 100 mM dNTPs in appropriate buffer. The reaction was halted by adding EDTA to 10 mM concentration and heating to 75 °C for 20 min to denature the polymerase. After purification with a QIAquick spin column (Qiagen, Valencia CA), repaired fragments were phosphorylated by incubation with 10 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and rATP following the manufacturer’s directions. Polished blunt-end fragments were ligated with 20 ng of Sma I-digested, dephosphorylated vector (Fermentas, Hanover MD) at a 4:1 insert: plasmid molar ratio, by incubation with 400 U of T4 DNA ligase (NEB) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The ligation mix was used to transform E. coli JM109 cells (Promega, Madison WI) following the manufacturer’s protocols, and colonies were amplified using M13 primers by colony PCR ( Woodman, 2008 ). PCR products were sized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ∼two 96-well plates of appropriately-sized products were sequenced in the forward direction using BigDye v3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems [ABI], Foster City, CA), electrophoresed on an ABI 3730XL at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center. Assembly and alignment .—For the two Sanger approaches (A and B), primers and vector (if any) were trimmed and sequences assembled using Sequencher v4.9 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor MI). Methods for assembly of the Illumina data used here have been described elsewhere ( Barker et al., in press ), but in short, low coverage whole genome shotgun sequence was assembled using Velvet ( Zerbino and Birney, 2008 ), mitogenome sequences identified, and incomplete sequences finished using PRICE ( Ruby et al., 2013 ) and/or Gapfiller ( Boetzer and Pirovano, 2012 ). Using Geneious ( Biomatters, 2013 ), reads were mapped back to the assembled consensus to evaluate levels and evenness of coverage, assess possible assembly artifacts (e.g., indels, violations of pairing orientation or expected pair distances), and guide end-trimming prior to gap filling. Assembled mitogenome contigs were rotated so as to begin at tRNA-Phe, then aligned against a reference mitogenome ( Taeniopygia , DQ422742) in Geneious , and gene boundaries annotated. Due to questions of homology within passerines ( Mindell et al., 1998; Singh et al., 2008 ), and the failure to completely assemble the control region and some flanking sequence from a number of genomic shotgun sequence data sets, mitogenomes were truncated after tRNA-Thr prior to alignment (thus excluding tRNA-Pro, ND6, tRNA-Glu and the control region from alignment and subsequent phylogenetic analyses). Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.6 ( Edgar, 2004 ), with default parameters. 2.3 Phylogenetic analyses The alignment obtained was analyzed using both unpartitioned and partitioned approaches, using both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. The data were partitioned using an optimal partitioning scheme selected by Partitionfinder v1.1.1 ( Lanfear et al., 2012 ): these analyses used a greedy search algorithm under the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978 ). Partitions were tested for variation in base composition using a χ 2 test of homogeneity, as implemented in PAUP * v4.0b10 ( Swofford, 2000 ). In order to explore the impact of indel-rich regions on phylogenetic analysis, analyses were performed after excluding sites from the alignment (filtering) using Gblocks v0.91 ( Castresana, 2000 ), with the minimum number of positions for a conserved position set at 50%, for a flanking position at 85%, a maximum of 8 contiguous non-conserved positions, a minimum block length of 4, and allowing up to 50% of taxa to have a gap at a given site. In order to ameliorate the effects of taxon-specific base compositional biases (see Results), as well as to reduce the impact of transitional relative to transversional substitutions, analyses were performed using AGY coding (a second type of filtering; Gibson et al., 2005 ). A detailed annotation of Agelaius , indicating the position of each gene, coding position, RNA paired and unpaired, and non-coding site ( Powell et al., 2013 ) was mapped onto the alignment to generate character sets corresponding to these features. All maximum likelihood analyses were performed in RAxML ( Stamatakis, 2006 ) either using v7.6.3 on XSEDE through the CIPRES Science Gateway ( Miller et al., 2010 ), or locally using v7.7.0. Searches for optimal trees were performed under the best fit model chosen by Partitionfinder , with 20 random starting trees. For each partitioning scheme and matrix (e.g., original alignment, Gblocks -filtered, AGY-filtered), non-parametric bootstrapping ( Felsenstein, 1985 ) was performed with 500 replicates, each starting from a single parsimony starting tree. Partitioned Bayesian analyses of the unfiltered matrix were performed in MrBayes v3.2.2 ( Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003 ) on a local cluster. Multiple 4-chain Metropolis-coupled analyses (with default heating) were run 2 × 10 7 generations, sampling every 1000. These analyses unlinked all substitution model parameters, with branch lengths constrained to proportionality. Appropriate burn-in, run convergence and parameter posteriors were assessed using Tracer v1.5 ( Rambaut and Drummond, 2004 ), and convergence of nodal posterior probabilities using AWTY ( Nylander et al., 2004 ). 3 Results 3.1 Assembly and alignment Assemblies of three out of the five species sequenced using Sanger methods ( Table 3 ) were complete, while the remaining two were nearly so. The sequence of Bombycilla is missing 81 bases of ND5 in two short segments, 64 bases of CYTB, and part of the 3’ end of the control region, whereas the sequence of Hyliota is missing a substantial portion of the control region due to a repeat expansion in its 3’ end. Of the ten samples for which de novo mitogenome assembly from whole genome shotgun data was attempted, only four (all with the standard avian gene order) yielded complete mitogenomes ( Table 3 ), although partial mitogenome sequences covering the region from tRNA-Phe through tRNA-Thr (∼90% of the genome) were obtained from all species. These sequences have been submitted to GenBank (accessions KJ909186 – KJ909200 ). Velvet assemblies typically foundered in or near the control region, probably due to similarities between the functional and decaying control regions in species with the “remnant” configuration ( Singh et al., 2008 ), as well as heteroplasmy of repeat expansions in some species ( Mundy et al., 1996 ). Even coverage for the completely-assembled mitogenomes indicated that all had the “standard” gene order ( Gibb et al., 2007 ). MUSCLE alignment of the assembled and trimmed mitogenome sequences was straightforward, and yielded an alignment with relatively few gapped positions (1347 or 8.7%). This alignment has been deposited in TreeBASE ( http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S15907 ). Given the straightforward alignment, few (643 or 4%) gapped sites were filtered by a Gblocks analysis using the parameters described above, primarily in unpaired regions of RNA genes and intergenic spacers. 3.2 Model fit and base compositional heterogeneity Analysis of the unfiltered alignment using Partitionfinder returned a fourteen partition model as the best fit ( Table 4 ). Partitions primarily recognized codon position of protein-coding genes (including three partitions each for most first, second, and third codon positions) and paired (helix) versus unpaired (non-helix) positions of ribosomal genes, with some protein-coding first codon position sites combined with the ribosomal genes ( Table 4 ). Partitions differed substantially in relative nucleotide substitution rates, base composition, among-site rate heterogeneity ( α ranging from 0.4 to 1.8), and proportion of invariant sites (from 1% to 76%). Rates of evolution also varied widely, ranging from 4.2 substitutions/site (partition 7, consisting of second positions of codons) to 115.5 substitutions/site (partition 14, consisting of third positions of codons). Of these fourteen partitions, the three consisting entirely of codon third positions all deviated significantly from base compositional homogeneity as judged by the (generally conservative) χ 2 contingency test (all values >1300, p < 0.0001). To explore this pattern further, third position base frequencies were plotted by taxon, sorting by the proportion of cytosine (per Gibson et al., 2005 ). This qualitative analysis ( Fig. 1 ) strongly indicated that while the proportion of guanine was constant and low, the proportion of cytosine ranged widely (from ∼0.35 to 0.5), and was strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of thymine (and to a lesser extent adenine). This is reflected in the strong negative correlation (Pearson’s r = −0.8) of C and T frequencies among species which was higher than all other among-base correlations. This analysis provides strong a priori justification for use of methods that do not assume stationarity ( Boussau and Gouy, 2006; Foster, 2004; Gowri-Shankar and Jow, 2006 ), or filtering of the data to remove C–T transitional differences (AGY-filtering), as suggested by Gibson et al. (2005) for ordinal sampling of mammal mitogenomes. Due to computational limitations of non-stationary methods in handling large matrices, this study focuses on the latter approach. 3.3 Phylogeny inference Phylogenetic analyses of the mitogenome data generally yielded fully-resolved, well-supported hypotheses of relationship. However, the specific topologies obtained and the support measures for inferred relationships varied to some degree among analyses (e.g., partitioning and filtering of data, see Fig. 2 ), including at some nodes of interest. Three of six ML analyses yielded the same topology ( Fig. 2 A), whereas the remaining three yielded topologies ( Fig. 2 B–D) that differed slightly, primarily in the arrangement of Oedistoma , Notiomystis , and the Petroicidae at a deeper level, and of Hyliota , Poecile , Alauda and Bombycilla + Regulus at a more recent level. In addition to these topological differences, support for some relationships varied extensively among analyses, while other results were robust to analytical details ( Fig. 2 , Table 5 ). Individual analyses varied in overall support, ranging from 78% to 87% of nodes (out of a maximum of 122) receiving ⩾75% bootstrap support. In general, unpartitioned, unfiltered analyses yielded higher nodal support values than corresponding partitioned or filtered approaches, both in terms of overall support and for specific relationships ( Fig. 3 ). A partitioned Bayesian analysis of the unfiltered matrix yielded a maximum clade credibility tree with relationships as in Fig. 2 D. As is typically found in comparisons of Bayesian posteriors and non-parametric bootstraps, nodal support for most relationships was higher than in corresponding ML analyses, with only eight nodes receiving estimated posterior probabilities <0.95. Given the non-stationarity described above, and the critical importance of partitioning in properly describing mitogenome sequence evolution ( Krajewski et al., 2010; Powell et al., 2013 ), the partitioned, AGY-filtered analysis is arguably the best representation of these data ( Fig. 4 ). One apparent artifact in these analyses regarded placement of a GenBank sequence (accession HM535648 ) labeled Pseudopodoces (Hume’s ground tit), which fell inside of a clade otherwise including members of the family Muscicapidae. This specimen is clearly mislabelled, as this genus is indisputably a highly-derived corvid-like member of the Paridae ( James et al., 2003 ), and the true parid sequenced here is more closely related to the sylvioid passerines, as expected: the discussion below assumes that the “ Pseudopodoces ” sequence is an unidentified muscicapid. Other specific relationships recovered in these analyses are discussed in detail below. 4 Discussion 4.1 Mitochondrial corroboration of established phylogenetic relationships among passerines The mitogenomic data analyzed here corroborate many higher-level passerine relationships strongly supported in previous studies, as well as recovering novel hypotheses with important implications for passerine evolution. With regard to previously-established relationships, these data strongly support the following clades ( Figs. 2 and 4 ): (1) a basal split between Tyranni and oscines ( Barker et al., 2002; Ericson et al., 2002a; Hackett et al., 2008 ); (2) monophyly of New World subscines to the exclusion of the Old World subscines (represented here only by Smithornis ; Barker et al., 2002; Ericson et al., 2002a; Hackett et al., 2008 ); (3) a basal split between the lyrebird Menura and all other oscines ( Barker et al., 2002; Ericson et al., 2002b; Hackett et al., 2008 ); (4) a subsequent split between Meliphagoids ( Malurus and Ephthianura ) and the remaining oscines (except Menura and the Ptilonorhynchidae + Climacteridae, the latter unsampled here; Barker et al., 2002; Hackett et al., 2008 ); and (5) a clade containing two major groups corresponding to the “core Corvoidea” ( Barker et al., 2004 ) on the one hand and the Passerida ( sensu stricto , Barker et al., 2004 ) and its closest relatives ( Oedistoma , Notiomystis , Petroicidae , and Picathartes ) on the other ( Aggerbeck et al., 2014; Barker et al., 2004; Treplin et al., 2008 ). Within these major groupings, the mitogenomic data also corroborate a number of previously-established relationships, including: (1) monophyletic Furnariida and Tyrannida ( sensu Ericson et al., 2002b ) within the suboscines ( Barker et al., 2002; Hackett et al., 2008; Irestedt et al., 2001; Treplin et al., 2008 ), (2) a clade including Laniidae and Corvidae to the exclusion of Vireo and Oriolus ( Aggerbeck et al., 2014; Barker et al., 2004 ), (3) association of Old World warblers ( Acrocephalus ), babblers ( Sylvia , Garrulax , and Leiothrix ), bulbuls ( Pycnonotus ), and swallows ( Tachycineta ) in a clade of Sylvioidea ( Alström et al., 2005; Barker et al., 2002; Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Fregin et al., 2012; Johansson et al., 2008; Treplin et al., 2008 ), (4) monophyly of a clade of finch-like birds roughly corresponding to the Passeroidea ( Barker et al., 2002; Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Johansson et al., 2008; Treplin et al., 2008 ), (5) within passeroids, a sequence of splits between Estrildidae, Passeridae, and Fringillidae + New World nine-primaried oscines ( Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Treplin et al., 2008 ), (6) monophyly of a clade of thrush-like birds in a clade of Muscicapoidea ( Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Cibois and Cracraft, 2004; Johansson et al., 2008; Treplin et al., 2008 ), and (7) a basal split within muscicapoids between starlings and thrushes, and a split within thrushes between typical thrushes (Turdidae) and flycatchers, chats and allies (Muscicapidae; Cibois and Cracraft, 2004; Sangster et al., 2010; Treplin et al., 2008; Zuccon et al., 2006 ). 4.2 A mitochondrial perspective on the corvoid-Passerida transition As noted above, these data also resolve some passerine relationships that have remained unresolved in previous studies, or that have proven controversial because of differences in taxon or gene sampling. One of these areas involves relationships among the core Corvoidea, the Passerida ( sensu stricto , excluding taxa such as Irenidae that were clearly misplaced in early DNA hybridization studies), and deeply-divergent “transitional” groups including the Cnemophilidae, Melanocharitidae, Notiomystidae, Callaeidae, Petroicidae, and Picathartidae. Previous studies have varied in the placement of these taxa, as well as the strength of support for their placement. The earliest evidence for their relationships came from nuclear DNA sequence studies, including that of Barker et al. (2002) that showed (without sampling Petroicidae) moderate support for Picathartidae as sister of the Passerida, and that of Ericson et al. (2002b) that very weakly supported Petroicidae (represented by Eopsaltria ) as the sister to Passerida (without having sampled Picathartidae). A subsequent study of Passerida by Ericson and Johansson (2003) sampled both Picathartidae and Petroicidae, but found the former most closely related to Passerida (and included it in that clade, based on the presence of a shared indel in c- myc ). Although included, placement of Petroicidae in that study relative to Passerida was not presented. Barker et al.’s (2004) study of RAG exons found Petroicidae and Picathartidae as sequential sister taxa to the Passerida, although this relationship was only strongly supported in Bayesian analyses, and neither Bayesian nor ML analyses significantly favored Petroicidae or Picathartidae as sister to Passerida. The same study found weak support for a monophyletic grouping of Cnemophilidae, Callaeidae and Melanocharitidae, with this clade in turn sister to the core Corvoidea. Placement of this group of families was only strongly supported in Bayesian analysis, and its monophyly was not strongly supported by any analysis. A subsequent study by Jonsson et al. (2007) based on three nuclear introns also recovered Picathartidae and Petroicidae as the closest relatives to Passerida, although this study found the two families to be sister taxa (with weak Bayesian support). This much smaller study did not sample the other groups listed above. The only other study to sample these transitional groups as thoroughly as Barker et al. (2004) was that of Irestedt and Ohlson (2008) , which sampled both RAG exons as well as three additional introns (from MB, GAPDH, and ODC). Their preferred analysis (that excluded RAG1 data) yielded a topology with all of these transitional taxa in a grade leading to the crown Passerida. However, placement of the Melanocharitidae in this grade was only weakly supported (even in Bayesian analysis), and inclusion of RAG1 data favored its placement with the core Corvoidea. Among the remaining taxa, their analysis failed to resolve relationships robustly, except for demonstrating that the Cnemophilidae were the most distantly related to Passerida. The current study strongly supports placement of Melanocharitidae, Notiomystidae, Petroicidae, and Picathartidae in a grade leading to a generally well-supported monophyletic Passerida. At the moment, the mitochondrial placement of Cnemophilidae and Callaeidae is unknown, but the latter at least should fall out as sister to Notiomystidae based on analyses of nuclear DNA ( Driskell et al., 2007; Ewen et al., 2006 ). Relationships among the sampled transitional taxa vary somewhat by analysis, as does support for specific relationships. All of the analyses place Picathartes sister to the Passerida, in agreement with the c- myc indel and intron data ( Ericson and Johansson, 2003; Irestedt and Ohlson, 2008 ). Either Petroicidae ( Fig. 2 A and D) or Petroicidae + Notiomystidae ( Fig. 2 B and C) appear as the next closest relative to Picathartidae + Passerida. However, support for relationships among these taxa and Oedistoma (Melanocharitidae) is poor. It is possible that these relationships might be stabilized by inclusion of representative Cnemophilidae and Callaeidae, as well as increased sampling of Melanocharitidae, Petroicidae, and Picathartidae. 4.3 Resolution of basal relationships among Passerida The other region of the tree where the mitogenome data offer resolution is at the base of the Passerida. Relationships among basal passeridan lineages have proven difficult to resolve, despite several studies with reasonable taxon sampling and multilocus sequence data. Barker et al. (2002, 2004) recovered clades roughly corresponding to Sibley and Ahlquist’s superfamilies Muscicapoidea, Sylvioidea and Passeroidea, although a number of genera or families fell outside their presumptive core groups (e.g., Alaudidae with Sylvioidea, Promeropidae with the Passeroidea). Those studies also identified a number of deeply-diverging lineages whose affinity was unclear, including the Bombycillidae, Regulidae, Paridae, Stenostiridae, and the so-called Certhioidea (the creepers, wrens, and allies). Unfortunately, the RAG data largely failed to resolve relationships among the major groups of Passerida and these deeply-divergent lineages. This lack of resolution was reinforced by concurrent and subsequent studies, such as those of Ericson and Johansson (2003 ; based on RAG1, c- myc , MB, and mitochondrial cytochrome b ), which represented passeridan relationships as a six-way polytomy, Fuchs et al. (2006; based on mitochondrial ND2 and nuclear MB intron) , Johansson et al. (2008 , based on MB, ODC, and FGB introns), and Treplin et al. (2008 ; based on the nuclear protein-coding genes RAG1, RAG2, ZENK, and c- myc ), the latter three yielding little better resolution than Ericson et al.’s polytomy. One notable result of the Fuchs et al. and Johansson et al. studies was identification of the presumptive sylvioid genus Hyliota as another deeply-diverging member of the Passerida with unclear affinities. Finally, two previous mitogenome studies have suggested resolution of passeridan relationships. One study ( Nabholz et al., 2010 ) analyzed mitochondrial transcriptome data from four species ( Parus , Muscicapa , Pipra , and Corvus ), in the context of eleven other passerine mitogenomes. That study found significant variation in basal passeridan relationships among analytical approaches, with some analyses showing strong support for a sylvioid + passeroid relationship, and others not. In their favored hypothesis, sylvioids and passeroids were sister to the parids, with Muscicapa sister to all other Passerida; however, the relationship of Parus with sylvioids and passeroids was only supported in one partitioned Bayesian analysis, with negligible support in other analyses. In the other study, Marshall et al. (2013) sequenced four mitogenomes from the finch species Fringilla coelebs , and analyzed them in the context of 29 passerine mitogenomes, making it the next most comprehensive passerine mitogenome study before this. Their codon-model Bayesian analysis of protein-coding genes strongly supported only a sister-group relationship between muscicapoids and passeroids, with sylvioids sister to both, contradicting Nabholz et al.’s results. The much more comprehensively-sampled mitogenome data analyzed here greatly improve our understanding of basal passeridan relationships, consistently pointing to a split between a clade of sylvioids, Hyliota , and Poecile on the one hand, and a strongly-supported clade comprising the Passeroidea, Muscicapoidea, Certhioidea, Bombycilla , and Regulus on the other ( Fig. 2 , node I; Fig. 4 ). This arrangement is similar to that obtained by Marshall et al., although that study did not include many of the deeply divergent passeridan taxa (Certhioidea, Bombycilla , Regulus , Poecile , or Hyliota ). Within the passeroid + muscicapoid clade, a sister-group relationship between Certhioidea and Muscicapoidea is universally recovered and generally well supported, though support drops as low as 42% in the partitioned analysis of the AGY-filtered matrix ( Fig. 2 , Table 5 ). These analyses also universally recover a sister group relationship between Bombycilla and Regulus , but support for this relationship is only strong in the unfiltered and Gblocks -filtered analyses, vanishing in the AGY-filtered analyses ( Fig. 2 , node L; Table 5 ). This suggests that base compositional biases likely play a role in attracting these two taxa, and indeed Bombycilla has the second-highest and Regulus the 13th highest C content at protein-coding third positions (most of the remaining C-rich taxa are suboscines and corvoids). Five out of six analyses place this pair as sister to Certhioidea + Muscicapoidea, but this is almost never well supported ( Fig. 2 , node J, Table 5 ). The Regulus + Bombycilla relationship is almost entirely novel, the exceptions being the parsimony analysis of Treplin et al. ( Treplin et al., 2008 ), which recovered the same grouping with 60% bootstrap, and the extensive gene sampling of Hackett et al. (2008) , which found the same grouping with 54% bootstrap support. The other major grouping within Passerida includes the Sylvioidea, Poecile , and Hyliota ( Fig. 2 , node F; Fig. 4 ). This clade receives moderate support from filtered and partitioned analyses, and is only weakly supported by the unfiltered, unpartitioned analysis. Relationships within this group are not well resolved. As currently delineated based on nuclear sequence data ( Alström et al., 2005; Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Fregin et al., 2012 ), Sylvioidea should include the larks (Alaudidae), but the mitogenome data are equivocal on this relationship, with only three out of six analyses recovering it, none with appreciable support ( Fig. 2 , node Q, Table 5 ). However, all the remaining sylvioids sampled do form a well-supported monophyletic group that is referred to here as the “core Sylvioidea”. Two other groups, the Paridae (represented by Poecile ) and Hyliota , appear either as sister taxa (3/6 ML analyses), or together in a clade with Alauda (with the latter sister to Poecile ), with all three sister to the core Sylvioidea. None of these alternative arrangements receive appreciable support. Additional sampling of deeply-divergent lineages that do or may fall in this region of the tree (e.g., Remiz , Stenostiridae, other larks) could help to stabilize these relationships. In summary, the mitogenomic data generally perform well in recovering passerine relationships at multiple hierarchical levels. Basal passerine relationships, including relationships among the suboscines and early-branching oscines such as the Menuroidea, Meliphagoidea, Corvoidea and Passerida and allies are strongly supported and congruent with robust results derived from multiple nuclear loci. These data strongly corroborate recent results regarding the placement of “transitional” forms most closely related to Passerida (e.g., Notiomystis , Petroicidae , Picathartes ), and better them by strongly supporting the placement of Oedistoma in this grade. Finally, the passerine mitogenome data for the first time resolve basal relationships among Passerida with respectable support. Although additional deeply-diverging lineages remain to be sampled in Passerida (e.g., Cnemophilidae, Stenostiridae, Promeropidae), these results are extremely encouraging regarding the future utility of mitogenome data in passerine phylogenetics. 4.4 Impact of analytical approaches on phylogenetic inference from mitogenomic data Both hypotheses of passerine phylogenetic relationships ( Fig. 2 ) and nodal support ( Table 5 , Figs. 3 and 4 ) varied significantly with analytical approach. Perhaps surprisingly, partitioned analyses yielded lower support values for relationships at all levels of support (compare “Unpartitioned” and “Partitionfinder” panels in Fig. 3 ). This result, noted previously in an analysis of icterid mitogenomes (a subset of the current data), suggests that unpartitioned analysis overestimates support for many phylogenetic relationships. The most likely explanation for this is long branch attraction ( Felsenstein, 1978 ). Since support for many relationships goes down slightly without changing the topology (see the upper right hand corner of many panels in Fig. 3 ), these trees may be in the so-called “Farris zone” ( Siddall, 1998 ) for at least some sites, where methods like parsimony or underparameterized likelihood might be biased in favor of “true” relationships ( Swofford et al., 2001 ). This underscores the need to adequately address heterogeneity in partition-specific evolutionary dynamics. The effect of filtering the data generally depended on whether the data were analyzed using partitioning or not. Without partitioning, Gblocks filtering slightly reduced support overall, changing very few relationships, whereas once partitioning was applied, Gblocks filtering had essentially no additional effect ( Fig. 3 ). This suggests that many of the sites filtered by Gblocks (i.e., spacers, some unpaired RNA sites) have significantly different evolutionary dynamics from the remaining data, but these differences are adequately addressed by partitioning rather than exclusion. For this reason, at this level of comparison Gblocks filtering does not appear warranted. The effects of AGY filtering were also context dependent, being much stronger in the unpartitioned than in partitioned analyses ( Fig. 3 ). In the former, AGY filtering strongly reduced overall support values, whereas in the latter it had very little effect above and beyond that of partitioning, although specific relationships were impacted by AGY filtering in a complex pattern. For example, on the one hand monophyly of the Passerida ( Table 5 , node D)—a clade strongly corroborated by nuclear data ( Barker et al., 2002, 2004; Ericson et al., 2002a; Hackett et al., 2008 )—was more strongly supported by the AGY-filtered than the unfiltered analysis without partitioning. On the other hand, unpartitioned and partitioned AGY-filtered analyses strongly reduced support for a Bombycilla + Regulus clade ( Table 5 , node L), although neither recovered an alternative relationship. Since the latter result may be caused (or at least artificially strengthened) by base compositional biases (see above), this should be seen in a positive light. Overall, the benefits of AGY filtering seem mixed. Although not shown here, combination of partitioning, Gblocks -filtering, and AGY coding does not appear to offer additional benefits, yielding results essentially the same as partitioned AGY-filtered analyses. Partitioning by itself seems to compensate for many of the effects addressed by the filtering strategies used here (e.g., saturation); however, it cannot address the issue of non-stationarity posed by these data. 4.5 Phylogenetic utility of passerine mitogenomes The use of mitogenomic data in inferring higher-level avian relationships has a somewhat checkered past. The earliest studies of complete avian mitogenomes (e.g., Mindell et al., 1999, 1997 ) yielded hypotheses of relationship strongly at odds with traditional notions of avian phylogeny, perhaps most notably placing the root of the avian tree between one or more Passeriformes and all other birds. Improved analytical approaches and increased taxon sampling have gone a long way to ameliorating such artifacts ( Braun and Kimball, 2002; Pratt et al., 2009 ). Even so, other than ordinal monophyly (with some notable exceptions) and some interordinal relationships (e.g., the Paleognath/Neognath split, the Galloanserae/Neoavian split, a clade of flamingos and grebes), higher-level relationships among birds remain largely unresolved with mitogenome data. To be fair, this does not appear to be entirely due to limitations of mtDNA, since multilocus nuclear data sets largely fail to resolve parts of the avian tree that are also unresolved by mitogenomes (e.g., basal relationships among Neoaves; Faircloth et al., 2012; Hackett et al., 2008; McCormack et al., 2013 ). By contrast, more recent mitogenome studies focusing on specific avian groups ( Cerasale et al., 2012b; Krajewski et al., 2010; Lerner et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2013 ) have proven far more successful, yielding fully resolved and generally well-supported hypotheses of relationship. The current study falls somewhere on the border between these two extremes. That is, mitogenome sequences perform relatively well in recovering relationships among passerine families, resolving a number of both deep and recent nodes that are strongly corroborated by nuclear data as well as supporting novel relationships that have not been resolved with any certainty until now ( Figs. 2 and 4 ; Table 5 ). On the other hand, some relationships (or nodal support values) vary with analytical approach, particularly along the grade leading to Passerida, and to some degree within Passerida as well. At least two factors are probably at play in the performance of mitogenome data in the current study. First, the taxon sampling here was focused more on deeply-diverging Passerida and allies than deeper in the tree. This may have artifically inflated resolution outside of these focal taxa. Second, the data analyzed here appear to span a range of divergences where saturation may begin to significantly impact accurate tree reconstruction. Evidence for saturation comes from comparison of mitgenome divergence to much more slowly-evolving nuclear loci. Fig. 5 shows a scatterplot of protein-coding gene divergence by codon position, as a function of divergence at the nuclear locus RAG1. This analysis is based on published RAG1 sequences for all genera in the mitogenome data set that had matching data. Third position transition divergences are clearly overprinting by ∼2% divergence in RAG1, somewhere at the level of intra-familial divergences in Fringillidae and Icteridae. By contrast, all first and second position changes, third position transversions, and all non-coding substitutions ( Supplementary online Fig. 2 ) evolve much more linearly, suggesting that they may perform similarly to nuclear loci within Passeriformes. As noted above, due primarily to issues of non-stationarity, the passerine mitogenome data were analyzed using AGY coding or filtering, which coincidentally eliminates C–T transitions from consideration. Perhaps unexpectedly given the high rate of third position transitions, AGY-filtering had the effect of reducing overall support (especially in the unpartitioned analysis, Fig. 3 ). By contrast, the AGY analyses strengthened a few specific relationships (e.g., node C in the unpartitioned analyses, node D in the partitioned), whose support may have been underestimated due to saturation effects. Ordinal-level studies of mitogenome data have favored RY-coding (elimination of both C–T and A–G transitions), due both to base compositional and sequence saturation concerns ( Morgan-Richards et al., 2008; Pratt et al., 2009; Slack et al., 2007 ). RY-coding was also applied to these data, but the results of those analyses (not shown) were quite similar to AGY-filtering, likely because the majority of third position transitions will be C–T, given the low stationary frequency of third position guanine. Overall, there is little evidence of the benefits of AGY-filtering from the perspective of transitional saturation within passerines. However, this approach will continue to be important in analysis of passerine mitogenomes due to the problem of non-stationarity (i.e. among-taxon variance in C and T frequencies), especially since available non-stationary likelihood and Bayesian methods are limited in their ability to perform thorough searches ( Boussau and Gouy, 2006 ) or to deal with large numbers of taxa ( Foster, 2004; Gowri-Shankar and Jow, 2006 ). The variance in topology and support among analytical approaches (e.g., types of filtering) introduces some ambiguity in interpretation of the mitogenome data. Some of this ambiguity might be eliminated by further increases in taxon sampling, especially given the high levels of divergence observed within passerines ( Graybeal, 1998; Hedtke et al., 2006; Hillis et al., 2003; Poe, 1998; Pollock et al., 2002; Zwickl and Hillis, 2002 ; but see Kim, 1996; Poe and Swofford, 1999; Rosenberg and Kumar, 2001, 2003 ). Future passerine mitogenome studies should focus on sampling deep splits within the major groups sampled here, in the hope that they will help resolve homoplasious changes and stabilize among-group relationships. However, it is possible that even with extensive sampling, passerine mitogenomic data will not be adequate to recover some deeper aspects of passerine phylogeny, and the issue of base compositional heterogeneity cannot be ignored. As importantly, mitogenome data represent a single genetic locus, and it must be borne in mind that horizontal gene transfer by hybridization may mislead interpretation of phylogenies generated from them (e.g., Hailer et al., 2012; Reid et al., 2012 ). Even so, judging from the results presented here inclusion of properly-analyzed mitogenomes along with other sources of data in a comprehensive approach to passerine phylogeny is likely to be beneficial.
