    "full_text": "Polyembryony has posed a significant impediment to the advancement of citrus hybrid breeding. FhRWP is widely regarded as a pivotal factor governing asexual reproduction in citrus, and prior research has demonstrated that FhARID1 , acting as an upstream regulator, modulates FhRWP expression. In this study, we performed a genome-wide characterization of the ARID-HMG-related genes using the short juvenile mini-citrus Fortunella hindsii . A total of 20 ARID-HMG-related genes were identified. Protein interaction network and enrichment analysis suggested that ARID-HMG-related proteins might might be involved in chromatin remodeling complexes. Knockout of FhARID1 in F. hindsii did not induce the conversion from polyembryony to monoembryony. However, fharid1 plants in T 1 generation exhibited abnormal proliferation at axillary buds, which is similar to phenotype of fhrwp plants. Expression analysis of fharid1 ovary tissues revealed the downregulation of FhRWP . The results indicated that FhARID1 , as an upstream regulator of FhRWP , has an effect on the development of citrus axillary buds. Expression analysis of overexpressed leaves of FhARID1 lines showed that no significant up-regulation of FhRWP , indicating that FhARID1 is not the sole upstream regulatory factor of FhRWP . Only FhARID2 showed a correlation in expression with FhARID1 among the ARID-related genes, further supporting the notion that this gene may be involved in complex formation rather than acting alone. Yeast two-hybrid and MS/MS spectra further indicated that FhARID1 function requires casein kinase II-mediated post-transcriptional phosphorylation. This study elucidated the function of FhARID1 in citrus apomixis and axillary bud development, providing a fundamental basis for understanding the role of ARID-HMG-related genes."

          "In angiosperms, seed formation can be achieved either through sexual reproduction or apomixis ( Underwood and Mercier, 2022 ). The process of sexual reproduction involves the occurrence of meiosis to generate gametes and the subsequent double fertilization of male and female gametes, whereas apomixis involves reproduction without fertilization; clonal embryos are produced through mitosis of either unreduced gametes or specific nucellar cells ( Koltunow and Grossniklaus, 2003 ). In citrus, apomixis (also known as polyembryony) refers to the development of embryos from nucellar tissue without undergoing meiosis, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the maternal parent ( Koltunow, 1993 ). The interference caused by nucellar embryos poses a significant challenge in citrus hybrid breeding, whereas apomixis is widely employed to stabilize hybrid vigor in crops ( Khanday et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Zhou et al., 2020 ). Therefore, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying apomictic traits in citrus not only facilitates the utilization of citrus germplasm resources but also offers novel insights into harnessing hybrid vigor in agricultural crops.",
          "Our previous investigation suggested that FhARID1 has the ability to directly bind to the promoter region of the citrus apomixis key regulator FhRWP , yet its precise function remains enigmatic. The protein FhARID1 comprises two conserved structural domains, namely the AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) and the HMG-box domain. The HMG-box is a protein domain first identified within the HMGB family of proteins, which are known for their association with chromatin and high mobility ( Stros, 2010 ). The primary function of the HMG-box is to prebend the DNA structure, thereby facilitating the binding of transcription factors to their target sites ( Grosschedl et al., 1994 ; Bustin, 1999 ; Hansen et al., 2008 ). In plants, HMG-box proteins can be classified into four distinct groups: HMGB-type proteins, structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1), proteins containing three HMG-box domains (3xHMG-box), and proteins that possess both an ARID and an HMG-box domain (ARID-HMG) ( Mallik et al., 2018 ). One example of the importance of HMG-box proteins is the role of HMGB1 in facilitating the binding of the transcription factor p53 by creating a suitable DNA bending structure ( McKinney and Prives, 2002 ; Rowell et al., 2012 ). The involvement of the AtHMGB15 protein in seed development was evidenced by the observed delay in pollen tube germination in AtHMGB15 mutants ( Xia et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis of AtHMGB15 revealed its involvement in a variety of biological processes, such as cell wall synthesis ( Mallik et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, the expression of HMGB genes in Arabidopsis thaliana is differentially regulated by abiotic stress treatments, indicating their essential role in regulating chromatin structure to promote gene expression ( Kim et al., 2010 ).",
          "The ARID is a DNA-binding module that, akin to the HMG-box domain, was initially identified as a transcription factor, Bright, in the mouse B-cell and Dead Ringer protein of Drosophila melanogaster ( Herrscher et al., 1995 ; Gregory et al., 1996 ; Wilsker et al., 2002 ). In most cases, the ARID domain is commonly found in conjunction with a variety of other protein domains, including the HSP, PHD, and HMG-box domains ( Riechmann et al., 2000 ). Interestingly, proteins possessing ARID domains have been discovered to actively participate in the intricate regulation of chromatin structure by serving as integral components of chromatin remodeling protein complexes ( Zinzalla, 2016 ).",
          "Proteins possessing both ARID and HMG domains constitute a unique class of proteins found exclusively in the plant kingdom ( Antosch et al., 2012 ). In mammals, HMGB and ARID proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and ubiquitous nonhistone chromatin binding ( Grasser et al., 2007a ). Citrus, one of the most extensively cultivated fruit trees and economically important woody plants in temperate regions, lacks comprehensive genome-wide information on the ARID-HMG gene family. Although in-depth studies of ARID-HMG-related proteins have been performed extensively in A. thaliana , research on these proteins in citrus is still scarce.",
          "Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins are crucial regulatory mechanisms that are widely distributed in nature, playing a pivotal role in regulating the cellular functions of various organisms ( Park et al., 2012 ; Chen et al., 2018 ). The protein casein kinase II (CK2) is a highly conserved enzyme that specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues and exhibits diverse physiological functions. The CK2 holoenzyme is a heterotetramer consisting of two α catalytic subunits and two β regulatory subunits ( Wang et al., 2022a ). CK2 is a prototypical multisubstrate protein kinase that interacts with numerous substrates. In humans, CK2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases, including cancer ( Gowda et al., 2017 ; Buljan et al., 2020 ; Borgo et al., 2021 ). CK2 also exerts regulatory functions throughout various stages of plant growth and development ( Mulekar and Huq, 2014 ). CK2B1 in Brassica juncea directly regulated swollen stem formation by phosphorylating E2Fa, a key regulator of the G1/S transition in the cell cycle ( Zhang et al., 2020 ).",
          "To further elucidate the function and regulatory network of FhARID1, we utilized the recently published genome of Fortunella hindsii ( Wang et al., 2022b ), an early flowering mini-citrus, to conduct a genome-wide identification and characterization of typical ARID-HMG-related genes in citrus. Knockout and overexpression of FhARID1 were performed to elucidate its function in the apomixis and axillary bud development in citrus. In addition, the interaction proteins with FhARID1 were also screened. In summary, the results of this study have improved our understanding of the regulatory interplay between FhARID and FhRWP , a pivotal gene associated with apomixis in citrus, and have provided a theoretical framework for a deeper understanding of ARID-HMG-related genes."

All ARID-HMG related genes were mapped to the F. hindsii chromosome. We found that these 20 genes were distributed on nine chromosomes except FhHMGB11 , with each chromosome containing 1–3 genes ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, most of the loci (65%) were located at the ends of the chromosome, only seven genes were located in the middle of the chromosome. To determine the physical and chemical properties of these proteins, the physical and chemical properties of these ARID-HMG related proteins were analyzed. The data presented in Table S2 indicated that ARID-HMG related genes encode polypeptides that range from 153 to 745 amino acids in length, with a predicted molecular weight range of 16.98–82.25 kD. It is plausible that the relatively smaller size of these proteins may aid in their intracellular transport and interaction, thus increasing the probability of their potential interactions with other molecules. The theoretical pI ranged from 4.76 to 10.74, while the grand average of hydropathicity values for all proteins are negative, ranging from −1.467 to −0.269, indicating that these proteins may tend to form clusters or aggregates in water. Most of these genes were predicted to be localized in the nucleus, while FhHMGB5 was localized in the cytoplasm, and FhARID5 was localized in the chloroplast ( Table S2 )."

The 3 FhARID/HMG type genes cluster with the 4 AtARID/HMG genes, and 6 FhHMGB genes cluster with the 7 AtHMGB type genes in A. thaliana ( Fig. 2 , A). The proteins associated with ARID could be classified into four types based on the C-terminal conserved domains: ARID-type, ARID/HMG, ARID/PHD, and ARID/HSP. Note that ARID-type genes contain only one ARID domain ( Fig. 2 , B). These results indicated strong agreement and similarity between the ARID-HMG related proteins of A. thaliana and F. hindsii . The exon and intron structures were analyzed using the amino acid sequence of the ARID-HMG related protein in F. hindsii .

As shown in Fig. 3 , A, most of the interactions between ARID-HMG related proteins have not been experimentally verified, but it was predicted that the SSRP protein FhHMGB8 can interact with most of the ARID-HMG related proteins. Alternatively, this protein may bind to SPT16, GTC2 and other chromatin factors to form the FACT complex, which acts as a histone chaperone to regulate the stable nucleosome structure. In addition, FhHMGB8 seems to be expected to participate in PAF1 complex histone methylation. Notably, the ARID/HMG genes FhARID1 , FhARID2 and FhARID3 may also interact with each other as components of the SWI/SNF complex multiprotein complex, which alters chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts in the nucleosome. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the genes in the interaction network, as shown in Fig. 3 , B, and it could be found that most of the genes were involved in DNA binding factor activity, nucleosynthesis, chromatin binding, transcription factors, structural components of chromatin, regulation of gene expression, and other related processes.

FhARID1 exhibited widespread expression in multiple tissues, including roots and leaves, with particularly high levels observed in ovules. However, its expression level in roots was relatively low ( Fig. 4 , A). Then, the transcriptome data of A. thaliana and F. hindsii tissues were used to analyze the expression profile of ARID-HMG related genes. The results showed that most genes in A. thaliana were widely expressed in all tissues. However, tissues exhibited distinct gene expression patterns, with seeds showing relatively lower levels and flowers and siliques displaying comparatively higher levels ( Fig. 4 , C). For F. hindsii , although most genes were expressed in a variety of tissues, they could be broadly divided into several categories ( Fig. 4 , B). In fruits, the expression levels of certain HMGB genes, such as FhHMGB7 , FhHMGB8 , and FhHMGB9 , exhibited remarkable prominence, whereas in flowers, the highly expressed HMGB genes included FhHMGB2 and FhHMGB11 . Most of the ARID genes tended to be expressed in stems and leaves ( FhARID3 , FhARID5 ). Due to the substantial disparities in organ structure between citrus and A. thaliana , the expression patterns of ARID -related orthologous genes also manifest dissimilarities. For instance, AtARID1-AtARID6 are predominantly expressed in flowers and siliques, whereas FhARID2 was prominently expressed in mature fruits, while FhARID9 tended to be expressed in flowers. The result also signifies the differentiation of ARID-HMGB-related genes in dicotyledons."

              "In our previous study, we found that FhARID1 can bind to the FhRWP promoter region, and FhRWP is a key factor controlling the apomixis in citrus ( Wang et al., 2022b ). To elucidate the function of the FhARID1 gene, we conducted a knockout experiment in F. hindsii by sequencing at least three different regions of the leaves, resulting in two homozygously edited T 0 transformants, D24 and D25 ( Fig. S2 ; Table S3 ). Both D24 and D25 produced an A-base insertion in the first exon of the coding region. It is worth noting that there were still some reads in D24 plants that showed the insertion of two A-bases, accounting for approximately 16.87%–48.23%. According to the editing and identification results of the D25 and D25-T 1 lines, we found that all plants exhibited additional single base insertions (A or T) in addition to producing single A base insertions, and no plants showed the WT type ( Table S3 ). Therefore, we believed that the FhARID1 sequences in D24 and D25 were completely mutated. Due to the tandem repetition of multiple A bases in this region, the sequence still had a high degree of homology after the insertion of the A base. We conducted homology alignment of this sequence, and the comparison results are shown in Fig. S2 . Therefore, we speculated that the additional editing type is caused by the re-editing of the Cas9 protein. Considering the possibility of off-target editing, the target site sequence did not show any off-target sequence on the CRISPR-P prediction website. Meanwhile, homologous comparison between the target site sequence and FhARID-related genes showed that the homologous alignment rate of the sequences were no more than 65%, and no typical PAM sites were found ( Fig. S3 ). Thus, the homologous gene sequences do not exist off-target.",
              "Furthermore, we performed qRT-PCR on the young leaves of D24 and D25. FhRWP showed a significant decreased expression level at D24 and D25 compared to WT ( Fig. 5 , C). However, we did not observe a conversion from polyembryony to monoembryony in the seeds of D24 ( Fig. 5 , A). It was worth mentioning that compared with WT plants, D24 and D25 plants were more compact ( Fig. S4 ), which is due to the proliferation and development of multiple lateral branches of axillary buds in early development. Since this phenotype was more obvious in the T 1 lines seedling stage, subsequently, we screened 10 offspring seedlings (D24-1–D24-5, D25-1–D25-5) and confirmed that all were homozygously edited and almost consistent with the maternal parent ( Table S3 ). In the growth process of the offspring, we observed abnormal proliferation of axillary buds in the T 1 generation of KO-ARID plants (D25-1), resulting in clusters of leaves or branches at lateral positions compared to the wild type ( Fig. 5 , B). To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted qRT-PCR analysis on ARID-related genes in axillary buds. Interestingly, we observed that the frameshift mutation of FhARID1 did not exhibit a significant impact on the transcriptome level ( Fig. S5 ), whereas the expression of FhARID2 was significantly upregulated in comparison with WT. No significant differences were observed in the expression levels of the remaining seven homologous genes ( Fig. 5 , D).",
              "To further explore the function of FhARID1 , we overexpressed the gene in F. hindsii and obtained five overexpression transgenic plants ( Fig. S6 ). Surprisingly, unlike the knockout plants, overexpression of the FhARID1 gene did not yield a significant phenotype compared to the WT, particularly in the axillary buds where no discernible phenotypic traits were observed ( Fig. 6 , A). Subsequently, we analyzed the expression levels in the young leaves, and the results showed that the expression of the FhARID1 gene was upregulated by more than 1000 times compared to WT ( Fig. 6 , B). However, the expression of FhRWP was not significantly upregulated ( Fig. 6 , C). Correspondingly, the FhARID2 gene was also significantly upregulated, although only by a difference of 2–10 fold. The expression levels of the other homologous genes FhARID3-FhARID9 did not show a significant difference compared to the control ( Fig. 6 , D). FhARID1 encodes a chromatin remodeling protein subunit, and we speculate that the function of this gene may depend on the formation of a complete chromatin remodeling complex. In short, the mutant results suggested that the FhARID1 gene may play a crucial role in the differentiation of F. hindsii axillary buds, and its functional loss disrupts the differentiation of this position. Although FhARID2 gene was upregulated, it cannot compensate for the phenotype. Interestingly, whether FhARID1 was knocked out or overexpressed, the expression of the FhARID2 gene was upregulated, indicating that these two genes may interact or have other regulatory relationships."

              "As highly intricate functional units, chromatin remodeling complexes exhibit a wide range of posttranslational modifications. To reveal the type of modifications, the yeast hybrid library was built using the ovule cDNA of apomixis F. hindsii . Yeast two-hybrid assays were utilized to identify the interacting proteins of FhARID1, and two genes, FhCK2β1 and FhCK2β2 (CK2 kinase β subunits), were screened ( Fig. 7 , A). The presence of five CK2 genes in F. hindsii , including three α subunits ( FhCK2α1 , FhCK2α2 , and FhCK2α3 ) and two β subunits ( FhCK2β1 and FhCK2β2 ), were confirmed through genome-wide analysis ( Fig. S7 ). A firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay was used to verify the interaction between FhARID1 and FhCK2β1 and FhCK2β2 ( Fig. 7 , B). The results of yeast two-hybrid and LCI experiments indicated that FhARID1 interacts with FhCK2β1 and FhCK2β2. Furthermore, the results of yeast two-hybrid and LCI experiments indicated that FhCK2β1 interacted with FhCK2α1 and FhCK2α3, while FhCK2β2 interacted with FhCK2α1 and FhCK2α2 ( Figs. S8 and S9 ), suggesting that CK2 may form various tetramers in citrus to regulate phosphorylation processes. To further investigate the phosphorylation of the FhARID1 protein, LC-MS/MS was employed to identify the phosphorylation sites, and it was found that Ser25 was phosphorylated ( Fig. 7 , C). This suggested that FhARID1 was specifically recognized by CK2β subunits, phosphorylated by the CK2 holoenzyme, and acts as a subunit of the chromatin remodeling protein complex. Further research is needed to investigate the other subunits of the complex."

              "The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) and HMG-box domain represent DNA interaction modules found in both sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific DNA binding proteins ( Patsialou et al., 2005 ; Hansen et al., 2008 ). ARID-HMG-related proteins participate in various biological processes in both mammals and plants, including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and chromatin remodeling ( Wilsker et al., 2002 ; Grasser et al., 2007b ; Euskirchen et al., 2012 ). Here, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of ARID-HMG-related genes in F. hindsii and explored their potential roles in plant development. We identified a total of 20 ARID-HMG-related genes evenly distributed across nine chromosomes of F. hindsii . Notably, most of these genes were situated at the chromosome ends, which are crucial for chromosome stability ( Bilaud et al., 1997 ; van Steensel et al., 1998 ). Thus, the functions of these proteins encoded in these regions might be implicated in chromatin regulation and maintenance. Moreover, owing to their relatively small size and strong hydrophobic properties, these proteins can readily interact with other proteins to form complexes in the cell, such as the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex which consists of 12–15 subunits and binds to enhancers or promoters to participate in transcriptional regulation ( Masliah-Planchon et al., 2015 )."

              "Based on transcriptome data from various tissues in F. hindsii , we observed that ARID-HMG-related genes exhibit differential expression levels in different tissues, suggesting that these genes may participate in fundamental biological processes in cells. During our investigation of the regulatory pathway of the FhRWP gene, we discovered the upstream regulatory gene FhARID1 ( Wang et al., 2022b ). However, the loss of function of FhARID1 did not lead to the conversion of polyembryony to monoembryony, despite the expression level of FhRWP was significantly down-regulated in KO lines. This may be due to the lacking of FhARID1 subunit in the chromatin remodeling complex, while functional redundancy of FhARID1 partially compensates for the regulatory ability of downstream genes. In addition, based on our analysis of gene expression levels in FhARID1 KO and OE transgenic lines, we proposed that there may be a synergistic regulatory relationship between FhARID1 and FhARID2 . Nevertheless, the phenotype of fharid1 mutants was similar to that seen in fhrwp mutans ( Song et al., 2024 ) , exhibiting both polyembryony seeds and abnormal proliferation of axillary buds. These results further support the notion that FhARID1 is indeed one of the regulatory factors of FhRWP , although it is highly likely that it is not the sole regulatory factor.",
              "Loss of FhARID1 led to abnormal proliferation of axillary buds, similar phenomena that have also been observed in other species. For instance, in the legume plant Lotus japonicus , the ARID protein SIP1 binded to the promoter region of the NIN protein and interacted with symRK to regulate root nodule development ( Zhu et al., 2008 ). Although reports on related genes in plants are relatively scarce, the role of this gene family has been extensively studied in tumorigenesis in humans and mammals as a tumor suppressor ( Kortschak et al., 2000 ; Lin et al., 2014 ). ARID1A reduces cell proliferation, promotes differentiation, induces apoptosis, and plays a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity ( Streppel et al., 2014 ; Guo et al., 2022a ). In addition, ARID-related proteins play a more diverse role in plant development, with most functional studies focused on A. thaliana . For example, AtARID1 was initially found to coregulate male and female gametogenesis with AtMET1 ( Li et al., 2017 ), and further research revealed that both ARID1 and AGO9 are involved in heterochromatic silencing by facilitating siRNA movement from the vegetative nucleus to the male germline ( Wu et al., 2021b ). As one of the subunits of the ISWI complex CRA type, AtARID5, with its ARID domain and PHD box, may promote the association of the ISWI complex with specific chromatin regions to regulate development and floral transition by recognizing AT-rich DNA and H3K4me3 ( Guo et al., 2022b ). AtHMGB15 is preferentially expressed in pollen grains and pollen tubes and has been shown to play a critical role in pollen tube growth ( Xia et al., 2014 ). It has also been associated with the cold stress response ( Mallik et al., 2020 ). Recent studies in rice have found that OsARID3 is a key transcriptional regulatory factor for the development of stem apical meristem (SAM), while overexpression of OsHMGB707 , a high mobility group protein, enhanced rice drought tolerance by promoting stress-related gene expression ( Xu et al., 2015 ). These findings indicate that the functions of ARID-related proteins have diversified as species have diverged.",
              "Overexpression of the FhARID1 gene did not affect normal plant development, which was also observed for other genes ( Tang et al., 2012 ; He et al., 2023 ). For instance, TaNAC2a transgenic plants grew normally compared to wild type but exhibited stronger tolerance to drought stress, indicating that such genes may participate in biological or abiotic stress responses, resulting in phenotypes that are not abnormal under normal conditions. Moreover, the chromatin remodeling complex is a multifunctional unit ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 ; Michel et al., 2018 ), and ARID genes may be just one of its components. The complete function of the complex relies on the participation of each component, and it is reasonable to hypothesize that overexpression of a single gene may be limited by the insufficient number of other subunits and may not exert its full function. Naturally, it is plausible that FhARID1 might exclusively govern the chromatin status, while concurrently involving other activators. These potential factors may elucidate the absence of a significant phenotype change in the expression level of FhRWP in OE- FhARID1 lines."

              "Based on predicted protein interaction networks and enrichment analysis, ARID-HMG-related proteins, as potential chromatin remodeling proteins, can interact with SPT, ELF, VIP, GTC, and other proteins to form chromatin complexes and polymerase-related factors, and regulate gene expression ( Liu et al., 2011 ; Nakagawa et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, there may be complex interactions among ARID-HMG-related proteins, as reported in other species. For example, AtHMGB15 can form homodimers and interact with ARID-HMG1, ARID-HMG2, and AtHMGB11 in plant cells to form complexes. In human studies, the SWI/SNF multisubunit complex contains four mutually exclusive DNA-binding subunits, ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, and GLTSCR1/GLTSCR1L, all of which participate in tumor suppression ( Wang et al., 1996 ; Yan et al., 2005 ; Michel et al., 2018 ).",
              "On the other hand, the proper function of complex protein networks depends on various epigenetic and posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation ( Ruthenburg et al., 2011 ). Numerous studies have demonstrated that ARID-HMG-related proteins undergo extensive posttranslational modifications. For instance, SSRP1 recognizes nucleosome particles and superhelical and circular DNA through its structure, and the specificity of DNA binding is regulated by CK2-dependent phosphorylation ( Krohn et al., 2003 ). In A. thaliana , AtARID5 recognizes both H3K4me3 histone marks and AT-rich DNA through its Arid-phd double domain box and regulates development and floral transition through histone modification ( Tan et al., 2020 ). Our study also identified CK2-dependent phosphorylation of FhARID1, but the exact function of this modification in the protein or complex remains to be further elucidated.",
              "ARID-HMG-related proteins play crucial roles in the growth and development of both humans and animals, as well as plants. However, due to the intricate structure of chromatin remodeling complexes and the limited maturity of methods and techniques related to chromatin dynamics, research on chromatin remodeling proteins in plants remains relatively limited. With the continuous advancement of genomics and molecular biology research, particularly in recent years, the cost of chromatin accessibility research, such as ATAC-seq, has decreased, and the complex structure and relatively intricate functions of this gene family in plant growth and development will gradually be elucidated."

Loss of function resulted in abnormal proliferation of axillary buds, while overexpression failed to produce visible phenotypes, which further supports the notion that this gene may participate in complex formation rather than acting alone.

    "full_text": "1 Introduction In angiosperms, seed formation can be achieved either through sexual reproduction or apomixis ( Underwood and Mercier, 2022 ). The process of sexual reproduction involves the occurrence of meiosis to generate gametes and the subsequent double fertilization of male and female gametes, whereas apomixis involves reproduction without fertilization; clonal embryos are produced through mitosis of either unreduced gametes or specific nucellar cells ( Koltunow and Grossniklaus, 2003 ). In citrus, apomixis (also known as polyembryony) refers to the development of embryos from nucellar tissue without undergoing meiosis, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the maternal parent ( Koltunow, 1993 ). The interference caused by nucellar embryos poses a significant challenge in citrus hybrid breeding, whereas apomixis is widely employed to stabilize hybrid vigor in crops ( Khanday et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Zhou et al., 2020 ). Therefore, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying apomictic traits in citrus not only facilitates the utilization of citrus germplasm resources but also offers novel insights into harnessing hybrid vigor in agricultural crops. Our previous investigation suggested that FhARID1 has the ability to directly bind to the promoter region of the citrus apomixis key regulator FhRWP , yet its precise function remains enigmatic. The protein FhARID1 comprises two conserved structural domains, namely the AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) and the HMG-box domain. The HMG-box is a protein domain first identified within the HMGB family of proteins, which are known for their association with chromatin and high mobility ( Stros, 2010 ). The primary function of the HMG-box is to prebend the DNA structure, thereby facilitating the binding of transcription factors to their target sites ( Grosschedl et al., 1994 ; Bustin, 1999 ; Hansen et al., 2008 ). In plants, HMG-box proteins can be classified into four distinct groups: HMGB-type proteins, structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1), proteins containing three HMG-box domains (3xHMG-box), and proteins that possess both an ARID and an HMG-box domain (ARID-HMG) ( Mallik et al., 2018 ). One example of the importance of HMG-box proteins is the role of HMGB1 in facilitating the binding of the transcription factor p53 by creating a suitable DNA bending structure ( McKinney and Prives, 2002 ; Rowell et al., 2012 ). The involvement of the AtHMGB15 protein in seed development was evidenced by the observed delay in pollen tube germination in AtHMGB15 mutants ( Xia et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis of AtHMGB15 revealed its involvement in a variety of biological processes, such as cell wall synthesis ( Mallik et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, the expression of HMGB genes in Arabidopsis thaliana is differentially regulated by abiotic stress treatments, indicating their essential role in regulating chromatin structure to promote gene expression ( Kim et al., 2010 ). The ARID is a DNA-binding module that, akin to the HMG-box domain, was initially identified as a transcription factor, Bright, in the mouse B-cell and Dead Ringer protein of Drosophila melanogaster ( Herrscher et al., 1995 ; Gregory et al., 1996 ; Wilsker et al., 2002 ). In most cases, the ARID domain is commonly found in conjunction with a variety of other protein domains, including the HSP, PHD, and HMG-box domains ( Riechmann et al., 2000 ). Interestingly, proteins possessing ARID domains have been discovered to actively participate in the intricate regulation of chromatin structure by serving as integral components of chromatin remodeling protein complexes ( Zinzalla, 2016 ). Proteins possessing both ARID and HMG domains constitute a unique class of proteins found exclusively in the plant kingdom ( Antosch et al., 2012 ). In mammals, HMGB and ARID proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and ubiquitous nonhistone chromatin binding ( Grasser et al., 2007a ). Citrus, one of the most extensively cultivated fruit trees and economically important woody plants in temperate regions, lacks comprehensive genome-wide information on the ARID-HMG gene family. Although in-depth studies of ARID-HMG-related proteins have been performed extensively in A. thaliana , research on these proteins in citrus is still scarce. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins are crucial regulatory mechanisms that are widely distributed in nature, playing a pivotal role in regulating the cellular functions of various organisms ( Park et al., 2012 ; Chen et al., 2018 ). The protein casein kinase II (CK2) is a highly conserved enzyme that specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues and exhibits diverse physiological functions. The CK2 holoenzyme is a heterotetramer consisting of two α catalytic subunits and two β regulatory subunits ( Wang et al., 2022a ). CK2 is a prototypical multisubstrate protein kinase that interacts with numerous substrates. In humans, CK2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases, including cancer ( Gowda et al., 2017 ; Buljan et al., 2020 ; Borgo et al., 2021 ). CK2 also exerts regulatory functions throughout various stages of plant growth and development ( Mulekar and Huq, 2014 ). CK2B1 in Brassica juncea directly regulated swollen stem formation by phosphorylating E2Fa, a key regulator of the G1/S transition in the cell cycle ( Zhang et al., 2020 ). To further elucidate the function and regulatory network of FhARID1, we utilized the recently published genome of Fortunella hindsii ( Wang et al., 2022b ), an early flowering mini-citrus, to conduct a genome-wide identification and characterization of typical ARID-HMG-related genes in citrus. Knockout and overexpression of FhARID1 were performed to elucidate its function in the apomixis and axillary bud development in citrus. In addition, the interaction proteins with FhARID1 were also screened. In summary, the results of this study have improved our understanding of the regulatory interplay between FhARID and FhRWP , a pivotal gene associated with apomixis in citrus, and have provided a theoretical framework for a deeper understanding of ARID-HMG-related genes. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials, plasmid vectors construction and genetic transformation Seeds of F. hindsii were obtained from the National Citrus Planting Resource Nursery of Huazhong Agricultural University. Seedling epicotyls of these seeds were used for genetic transformation. The sgRNA targeting FhARID1 were designed using the CRISPR-P 2.0 web server ( http://crispr.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/CRISPR/CRISPR ) to construct the CRISPR/Cas9 vectors ( Liu et al., 2017 ). The protocol for CRISPR/Cas9 vector construction and mutation detection were conducted as previously described ( Song et al., 2023 ). For overexpression of FhARID1 , the CDS of FhARID1 were amplified and inserted into the entry vector pDONR221 and subsequently recombined into the binary overexpression destination vectors PK7WG2D (kanamycin resistance). The procedure of Agrobacterium -mediated epicotyl segments genetic transformation was performed as previously described ( Zhu et al., 2019 ). 2.2 Identification of the FhARID-HMG related genes in citrus genome The F. hindsii genome sequence was downloaded from the previous studies data ( https://zenodo.org/record/5748662#.Y5tveHa-ubg ) to identify the FhARID-HMG related genes. Hmmsearch v3.3.2 was performed to search against the F. hindsii database using the HMM profile of the ARID domain (PF01388) and HMG-box (PF00505), which was obtained from the Pfam database ( https://pfam.xfam.org/ ), as the search query and the filtering value of E -value is set to 10 −5 ( Potter et al., 2018 ). Subsequently, the physical and chemical properties of the ARID-HMG related proteins were analyzed using the online tool ExPASy-ProtParam ( https://web.expasy.org/protparam/ ) ( Wilkins et al., 1999 ). Subcellular localization was predicted for all genes using online tool WoLF PSORT ( https://wolfpsort.hgc.jp/ ). The genes that were eventually identified were renamed. The A. thaliana ARID-HMG related amino acid sequences were retrieved from the TAIR database ( http://www.A.thaliana.org/ ). 2.3 Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis The retrieved ARID-HMG related amino acid sequences were used to perform phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequences alignment was performed using Mafft v7.490 with the default settings for the F. hindsii and A. thaliana ARID-HMG related amino acid sequences ( Rozewicki et al., 2019 ). The phylogenetic tree was generated using Fasttree v2.1.10 with the model of Le-Gascuel (2008) and bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Beautification of the evolutionary tree using online website ( https://itol.embl.de/itol.cgi ). 2.4 Chromosomal distribution and predicting the protein–protein interaction network of the ARID-HMG related genes The files containing the F. hindsii genetic annotations (Generic Feature Format Version 3) were downloaded from previous studies ( Wang et al., 2022b ). Then, TBtools was used to map the ARID-HMG related genes onto the specific chromosomes ( Chen et al., 2020 ). The orthologous proteins of the ARID-HMG related genes were used to predict the protein–protein interaction network in A. thaliana . STRING ( https://string-db.org/ ) was used to construct the functional interaction network of the proteins ( Szklarczyk et al., 2023 ). Ten additional related proteins were included in the interaction network. ARID-HMG related genes were enriched by ClusterProfiler ( Wu et al., 2021a ). 2.5 Expression profiles of the ARID-HMG related genes Raw data of RNA sequencing of various tissues (flower, leaf, root, stem, seed, seedling and red-mature fruit) in F. hindsii were downloaded from NCBI databases under BioProject PRJNA497956 and transcripts per million (TPM) value data file of various tissues (root, stem, leaf, flower, silique and seed) of A. thaliana were downloaded from the functional genomics data collection (from https:// www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress ). TBtools was used to generate the heatmap ( Chen et al., 2020 ). 2.6 RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis Total RNA extraction of F. hindsii (WT), KO- FhARID1 , OE- FhARID1 young leaves and ovary tissues were performed as previously described ( Lu et al., 2018 ). cDNA synthesis was conducted using the HiScript II RT SuperMix for qPCR (+gDNA wiper, Vazyme). The qRT-PCR primers of ARID related genes used in this study are listed in Table S1 . The endogenous reference gene was named FhActin . qRT-PCR was performed on the Roche LightCycler 480 system (Roche, https://www.roche.com ). The qRT-PCR procedure and calculation of the relative expression of genes were carried out as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). Each experiment was performed independently with three replicates. 2.7 Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analysis Y2H assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The CDS of FhARID1 and FhCK2 genes (included CK2α1, CK2α2, CK2α3, CK2β1, CK2β2 ) were amplified and inserted into pGBKT7 and pGADT7 to construct BD- FhARID1 , AD- FhCK2α1 , AD- FhCK2α2 , AD- FhCK2α3 , AD- FhCK2β1 , and AD- FhCK2β2 . The AD and BD fusion constructs were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 to examine self-activation (pGAD-T + BD- FhARID1 ) and the interaction between FhARID1 and FhCK2 genes (BD- FhARID1 + AD- FhCK2 genes), respectively. pGAD-T/pGBK-53 was used as a positive control, whereas pGAD-T/pGBK-Lam served as a negative control. Transformants were then screened on selection medium supplemented with SD base/−Trp/−Leu/−His/−Ade to determine the interaction of FhARID1 and FhCK2 genes. The primers for vector construction are listed in Table S1 . 2.8 Firefly luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assay The CDS of FhARID1 and FhCK2 genes without the termination codons were cloned into JW771 (nLUC) and JW772 (cLUC) vectors to obtain the FhARID1 -cLUC, nLUC- FhCK2 genes and FhCK2 genes-cLUC constructs for the LCI assay. The recombinant plasmids, along with the empty vector (nLUC and cLUC), were introduced into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the helper plasmids pSoup and P19. Negative controls were performed using empty vectors (JW771-nLUC and cLUC-JW771). The bacterial suspensions harboring respective constructs were mixed and then used to infiltrate leaves of N. benthamiana , followed by visualization of LUC fluorescence. The primers for vector construction are listed in Table S1 . 2.9 Phosphorylation activity analysis of CK2 The CDS of FhARID1 was amplified via PCR and cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector containing a GST-tag. The recombinant vectors were transformed into DH5α (BL21) and utilized to purify the GST-tagged proteins. The purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and visualized using Coomassie brilliant blue staining. An in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed by mixing 2 μL of recombinant tetrameric (α2β2) human CK2 (NEB) with 5 μg of GST- FhARID1 in a kinase buffer [25 mmol·L −1 Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmol·L −1 MgSO4, 2 mmol·L −1 DTT)] supplemented with 100 μmol·L −1 ATP, and incubating the mixture for 30 min at 30 °C. A control was prepared by using 5 μg of GST- FhARID1 in the kinase buffer supplemented with 100 mmol·L −1 ATP. The polypeptide was analyzed for phosphorylation sites using a mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Elite, Thermo Fisher, Singapore). 2.10 Statistical analysis All data were expressed as the means ± standard error of three replicates. The statistical analysis of data was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. Student's t -tests were conducted to determine the statistical significance of differences between transgenic lines and WT. 3 Results 3.1 Identification, chromosomal distribution, and physicochemical properties of the ARID-HMG related genes A total of 20 ARID-HMG related genes containing ARID or HMG-box domains were identified in F. hindsii and named FhHMGB1 - FhHMGB11 and FhARID1 - FhARID9 based on their domain characteristics. All ARID-HMG related genes were mapped to the F. hindsii chromosome. We found that these 20 genes were distributed on nine chromosomes except FhHMGB11 , with each chromosome containing 1–3 genes ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, most of the loci (65%) were located at the ends of the chromosome, only seven genes were located in the middle of the chromosome. To determine the physical and chemical properties of these proteins, the physical and chemical properties of these ARID-HMG related proteins were analyzed. The data presented in Table S2 indicated that ARID-HMG related genes encode polypeptides that range from 153 to 745 amino acids in length, with a predicted molecular weight range of 16.98–82.25 kD. It is plausible that the relatively smaller size of these proteins may aid in their intracellular transport and interaction, thus increasing the probability of their potential interactions with other molecules. The theoretical pI ranged from 4.76 to 10.74, while the grand average of hydropathicity values for all proteins are negative, ranging from −1.467 to −0.269, indicating that these proteins may tend to form clusters or aggregates in water. Most of these genes were predicted to be localized in the nucleus, while FhHMGB5 was localized in the cytoplasm, and FhARID5 was localized in the chloroplast ( Table S2 ). 3.2 Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses of the ARID-HMG related genes To assess the evolutionary relationship between ARID-HMG related proteins in F. hindsii and A. thaliana , multiple sequences of HMG- and ARID-related proteins were compared to reconstruct the Phylogenetic tree. In F. hindsii , there is one SSRP type gene, FhHMGB8 , which is consistent with A. thaliana , and one 3xHMG type gene, FhHMGB5 , whereas in A. thaliana , there are two 3xHMG genes. The 3 FhARID/HMG type genes cluster with the 4 AtARID/HMG genes, and 6 FhHMGB genes cluster with the 7 AtHMGB type genes in A. thaliana ( Fig. 2 , A). The proteins associated with ARID could be classified into four types based on the C-terminal conserved domains: ARID-type, ARID/HMG, ARID/PHD, and ARID/HSP. Note that ARID-type genes contain only one ARID domain ( Fig. 2 , B). These results indicated strong agreement and similarity between the ARID-HMG related proteins of A. thaliana and F. hindsii . The exon and intron structures were analyzed using the amino acid sequence of the ARID-HMG related protein in F. hindsii . As shown in Fig. S1 , the gene structure of this family was diverse, with 2–16 exons, all of which contain at least one intron. 3.3 Prediction of ARID-HMG related protein–protein interaction network Based on the evolutionary relationships, orthologous genes from A. thaliana were used to further analyze the protein interaction network. As shown in Fig. 3 , A, most of the interactions between ARID-HMG related proteins have not been experimentally verified, but it was predicted that the SSRP protein FhHMGB8 can interact with most of the ARID-HMG related proteins. Alternatively, this protein may bind to SPT16, GTC2 and other chromatin factors to form the FACT complex, which acts as a histone chaperone to regulate the stable nucleosome structure. In addition, FhHMGB8 seems to be expected to participate in PAF1 complex histone methylation. Notably, the ARID/HMG genes FhARID1 , FhARID2 and FhARID3 may also interact with each other as components of the SWI/SNF complex multiprotein complex, which alters chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts in the nucleosome. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the genes in the interaction network, as shown in Fig. 3 , B, and it could be found that most of the genes were involved in DNA binding factor activity, nucleosynthesis, chromatin binding, transcription factors, structural components of chromatin, regulation of gene expression, and other related processes. These results further demonstrated the function of ARID-HMG related proteins in chromatin structure regulation and gene expression regulation. 3.4 Expression profiles of the ARID-HMG related genes First, the expression profile of FhARID1 was measured by qRT-PCR. FhARID1 exhibited widespread expression in multiple tissues, including roots and leaves, with particularly high levels observed in ovules. However, its expression level in roots was relatively low ( Fig. 4 , A). Then, the transcriptome data of A. thaliana and F. hindsii tissues were used to analyze the expression profile of ARID-HMG related genes. The results showed that most genes in A. thaliana were widely expressed in all tissues. However, tissues exhibited distinct gene expression patterns, with seeds showing relatively lower levels and flowers and siliques displaying comparatively higher levels ( Fig. 4 , C). For F. hindsii , although most genes were expressed in a variety of tissues, they could be broadly divided into several categories ( Fig. 4 , B). In fruits, the expression levels of certain HMGB genes, such as FhHMGB7 , FhHMGB8 , and FhHMGB9 , exhibited remarkable prominence, whereas in flowers, the highly expressed HMGB genes included FhHMGB2 and FhHMGB11 . Most of the ARID genes tended to be expressed in stems and leaves ( FhARID3 , FhARID5 ). Due to the substantial disparities in organ structure between citrus and A. thaliana , the expression patterns of ARID -related orthologous genes also manifest dissimilarities. For instance, AtARID1-AtARID6 are predominantly expressed in flowers and siliques, whereas FhARID2 was prominently expressed in mature fruits, while FhARID9 tended to be expressed in flowers. The result also signifies the differentiation of ARID-HMGB-related genes in dicotyledons. 3.5 Transgenic functional validation In our previous study, we found that FhARID1 can bind to the FhRWP promoter region, and FhRWP is a key factor controlling the apomixis in citrus ( Wang et al., 2022b ). To elucidate the function of the FhARID1 gene, we conducted a knockout experiment in F. hindsii by sequencing at least three different regions of the leaves, resulting in two homozygously edited T 0 transformants, D24 and D25 ( Fig. S2 ; Table S3 ). Both D24 and D25 produced an A-base insertion in the first exon of the coding region. It is worth noting that there were still some reads in D24 plants that showed the insertion of two A-bases, accounting for approximately 16.87%–48.23%. According to the editing and identification results of the D25 and D25-T 1 lines, we found that all plants exhibited additional single base insertions (A or T) in addition to producing single A base insertions, and no plants showed the WT type ( Table S3 ). Therefore, we believed that the FhARID1 sequences in D24 and D25 were completely mutated. Due to the tandem repetition of multiple A bases in this region, the sequence still had a high degree of homology after the insertion of the A base. We conducted homology alignment of this sequence, and the comparison results are shown in Fig. S2 . Therefore, we speculated that the additional editing type is caused by the re-editing of the Cas9 protein. Considering the possibility of off-target editing, the target site sequence did not show any off-target sequence on the CRISPR-P prediction website. Meanwhile, homologous comparison between the target site sequence and FhARID-related genes showed that the homologous alignment rate of the sequences were no more than 65%, and no typical PAM sites were found ( Fig. S3 ). Thus, the homologous gene sequences do not exist off-target. Furthermore, we performed qRT-PCR on the young leaves of D24 and D25. FhRWP showed a significant decreased expression level at D24 and D25 compared to WT ( Fig. 5 , C). However, we did not observe a conversion from polyembryony to monoembryony in the seeds of D24 ( Fig. 5 , A). It was worth mentioning that compared with WT plants, D24 and D25 plants were more compact ( Fig. S4 ), which is due to the proliferation and development of multiple lateral branches of axillary buds in early development. Since this phenotype was more obvious in the T 1 lines seedling stage, subsequently, we screened 10 offspring seedlings (D24-1–D24-5, D25-1–D25-5) and confirmed that all were homozygously edited and almost consistent with the maternal parent ( Table S3 ). In the growth process of the offspring, we observed abnormal proliferation of axillary buds in the T 1 generation of KO-ARID plants (D25-1), resulting in clusters of leaves or branches at lateral positions compared to the wild type ( Fig. 5 , B). To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted qRT-PCR analysis on ARID-related genes in axillary buds. Interestingly, we observed that the frameshift mutation of FhARID1 did not exhibit a significant impact on the transcriptome level ( Fig. S5 ), whereas the expression of FhARID2 was significantly upregulated in comparison with WT. No significant differences were observed in the expression levels of the remaining seven homologous genes ( Fig. 5 , D). To further explore the function of FhARID1 , we overexpressed the gene in F. hindsii and obtained five overexpression transgenic plants ( Fig. S6 ). Surprisingly, unlike the knockout plants, overexpression of the FhARID1 gene did not yield a significant phenotype compared to the WT, particularly in the axillary buds where no discernible phenotypic traits were observed ( Fig. 6 , A). Subsequently, we analyzed the expression levels in the young leaves, and the results showed that the expression of the FhARID1 gene was upregulated by more than 1000 times compared to WT ( Fig. 6 , B). However, the expression of FhRWP was not significantly upregulated ( Fig. 6 , C). Correspondingly, the FhARID2 gene was also significantly upregulated, although only by a difference of 2–10 fold. The expression levels of the other homologous genes FhARID3-FhARID9 did not show a significant difference compared to the control ( Fig. 6 , D). FhARID1 encodes a chromatin remodeling protein subunit, and we speculate that the function of this gene may depend on the formation of a complete chromatin remodeling complex. In short, the mutant results suggested that the FhARID1 gene may play a crucial role in the differentiation of F. hindsii axillary buds, and its functional loss disrupts the differentiation of this position. Although FhARID2 gene was upregulated, it cannot compensate for the phenotype. Interestingly, whether FhARID1 was knocked out or overexpressed, the expression of the FhARID2 gene was upregulated, indicating that these two genes may interact or have other regulatory relationships. 3.6 Screening of interacting proteins and identification of phosphorylation sites of FhARID1 protein As highly intricate functional units, chromatin remodeling complexes exhibit a wide range of posttranslational modifications. To reveal the type of modifications, the yeast hybrid library was built using the ovule cDNA of apomixis F. hindsii . Yeast two-hybrid assays were utilized to identify the interacting proteins of FhARID1, and two genes, FhCK2β1 and FhCK2β2 (CK2 kinase β subunits), were screened ( Fig. 7 , A). The presence of five CK2 genes in F. hindsii , including three α subunits ( FhCK2α1 , FhCK2α2 , and FhCK2α3 ) and two β subunits ( FhCK2β1 and FhCK2β2 ), were confirmed through genome-wide analysis ( Fig. S7 ). A firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay was used to verify the interaction between FhARID1 and FhCK2β1 and FhCK2β2 ( Fig. 7 , B). The results of yeast two-hybrid and LCI experiments indicated that FhARID1 interacts with FhCK2β1 and FhCK2β2. Furthermore, the results of yeast two-hybrid and LCI experiments indicated that FhCK2β1 interacted with FhCK2α1 and FhCK2α3, while FhCK2β2 interacted with FhCK2α1 and FhCK2α2 ( Figs. S8 and S9 ), suggesting that CK2 may form various tetramers in citrus to regulate phosphorylation processes. To further investigate the phosphorylation of the FhARID1 protein, LC-MS/MS was employed to identify the phosphorylation sites, and it was found that Ser25 was phosphorylated ( Fig. 7 , C). This suggested that FhARID1 was specifically recognized by CK2β subunits, phosphorylated by the CK2 holoenzyme, and acts as a subunit of the chromatin remodeling protein complex. Further research is needed to investigate the other subunits of the complex. 4 Discussion 4.1 The characteristics of F. hindsii ARID-HMG-related proteins The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) and HMG-box domain represent DNA interaction modules found in both sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific DNA binding proteins ( Patsialou et al., 2005 ; Hansen et al., 2008 ). ARID-HMG-related proteins participate in various biological processes in both mammals and plants, including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and chromatin remodeling ( Wilsker et al., 2002 ; Grasser et al., 2007b ; Euskirchen et al., 2012 ). Here, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of ARID-HMG-related genes in F. hindsii and explored their potential roles in plant development. We identified a total of 20 ARID-HMG-related genes evenly distributed across nine chromosomes of F. hindsii . Notably, most of these genes were situated at the chromosome ends, which are crucial for chromosome stability ( Bilaud et al., 1997 ; van Steensel et al., 1998 ). Thus, the functions of these proteins encoded in these regions might be implicated in chromatin regulation and maintenance. Moreover, owing to their relatively small size and strong hydrophobic properties, these proteins can readily interact with other proteins to form complexes in the cell, such as the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex which consists of 12–15 subunits and binds to enhancers or promoters to participate in transcriptional regulation ( Masliah-Planchon et al., 2015 ). 4.2 Role of FhARID1 in apomixis and axillary bud development in citrus Based on transcriptome data from various tissues in F. hindsii , we observed that ARID-HMG-related genes exhibit differential expression levels in different tissues, suggesting that these genes may participate in fundamental biological processes in cells. During our investigation of the regulatory pathway of the FhRWP gene, we discovered the upstream regulatory gene FhARID1 ( Wang et al., 2022b ). However, the loss of function of FhARID1 did not lead to the conversion of polyembryony to monoembryony, despite the expression level of FhRWP was significantly down-regulated in KO lines. This may be due to the lacking of FhARID1 subunit in the chromatin remodeling complex, while functional redundancy of FhARID1 partially compensates for the regulatory ability of downstream genes. In addition, based on our analysis of gene expression levels in FhARID1 KO and OE transgenic lines, we proposed that there may be a synergistic regulatory relationship between FhARID1 and FhARID2 . Nevertheless, the phenotype of fharid1 mutants was similar to that seen in fhrwp mutans ( Song et al., 2024 ) , exhibiting both polyembryony seeds and abnormal proliferation of axillary buds. These results further support the notion that FhARID1 is indeed one of the regulatory factors of FhRWP , although it is highly likely that it is not the sole regulatory factor. Loss of FhARID1 led to abnormal proliferation of axillary buds, similar phenomena that have also been observed in other species. For instance, in the legume plant Lotus japonicus , the ARID protein SIP1 binded to the promoter region of the NIN protein and interacted with symRK to regulate root nodule development ( Zhu et al., 2008 ). Although reports on related genes in plants are relatively scarce, the role of this gene family has been extensively studied in tumorigenesis in humans and mammals as a tumor suppressor ( Kortschak et al., 2000 ; Lin et al., 2014 ). ARID1A reduces cell proliferation, promotes differentiation, induces apoptosis, and plays a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity ( Streppel et al., 2014 ; Guo et al., 2022a ). In addition, ARID-related proteins play a more diverse role in plant development, with most functional studies focused on A. thaliana . For example, AtARID1 was initially found to coregulate male and female gametogenesis with AtMET1 ( Li et al., 2017 ), and further research revealed that both ARID1 and AGO9 are involved in heterochromatic silencing by facilitating siRNA movement from the vegetative nucleus to the male germline ( Wu et al., 2021b ). As one of the subunits of the ISWI complex CRA type, AtARID5, with its ARID domain and PHD box, may promote the association of the ISWI complex with specific chromatin regions to regulate development and floral transition by recognizing AT-rich DNA and H3K4me3 ( Guo et al., 2022b ). AtHMGB15 is preferentially expressed in pollen grains and pollen tubes and has been shown to play a critical role in pollen tube growth ( Xia et al., 2014 ). It has also been associated with the cold stress response ( Mallik et al., 2020 ). Recent studies in rice have found that OsARID3 is a key transcriptional regulatory factor for the development of stem apical meristem (SAM), while overexpression of OsHMGB707 , a high mobility group protein, enhanced rice drought tolerance by promoting stress-related gene expression ( Xu et al., 2015 ). These findings indicate that the functions of ARID-related proteins have diversified as species have diverged. Overexpression of the FhARID1 gene did not affect normal plant development, which was also observed for other genes ( Tang et al., 2012 ; He et al., 2023 ). For instance, TaNAC2a transgenic plants grew normally compared to wild type but exhibited stronger tolerance to drought stress, indicating that such genes may participate in biological or abiotic stress responses, resulting in phenotypes that are not abnormal under normal conditions. Moreover, the chromatin remodeling complex is a multifunctional unit ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 ; Michel et al., 2018 ), and ARID genes may be just one of its components. The complete function of the complex relies on the participation of each component, and it is reasonable to hypothesize that overexpression of a single gene may be limited by the insufficient number of other subunits and may not exert its full function. Naturally, it is plausible that FhARID1 might exclusively govern the chromatin status, while concurrently involving other activators. These potential factors may elucidate the absence of a significant phenotype change in the expression level of FhRWP in OE- FhARID1 lines. 4.3 The interaction network of ARID-HMG-related proteins Based on predicted protein interaction networks and enrichment analysis, ARID-HMG-related proteins, as potential chromatin remodeling proteins, can interact with SPT, ELF, VIP, GTC, and other proteins to form chromatin complexes and polymerase-related factors, and regulate gene expression ( Liu et al., 2011 ; Nakagawa et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, there may be complex interactions among ARID-HMG-related proteins, as reported in other species. For example, AtHMGB15 can form homodimers and interact with ARID-HMG1, ARID-HMG2, and AtHMGB11 in plant cells to form complexes. In human studies, the SWI/SNF multisubunit complex contains four mutually exclusive DNA-binding subunits, ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, and GLTSCR1/GLTSCR1L, all of which participate in tumor suppression ( Wang et al., 1996 ; Yan et al., 2005 ; Michel et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, the proper function of complex protein networks depends on various epigenetic and posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation ( Ruthenburg et al., 2011 ). Numerous studies have demonstrated that ARID-HMG-related proteins undergo extensive posttranslational modifications. For instance, SSRP1 recognizes nucleosome particles and superhelical and circular DNA through its structure, and the specificity of DNA binding is regulated by CK2-dependent phosphorylation ( Krohn et al., 2003 ). In A. thaliana , AtARID5 recognizes both H3K4me3 histone marks and AT-rich DNA through its Arid-phd double domain box and regulates development and floral transition through histone modification ( Tan et al., 2020 ). Our study also identified CK2-dependent phosphorylation of FhARID1, but the exact function of this modification in the protein or complex remains to be further elucidated. ARID-HMG-related proteins play crucial roles in the growth and development of both humans and animals, as well as plants. However, due to the intricate structure of chromatin remodeling complexes and the limited maturity of methods and techniques related to chromatin dynamics, research on chromatin remodeling proteins in plants remains relatively limited. With the continuous advancement of genomics and molecular biology research, particularly in recent years, the cost of chromatin accessibility research, such as ATAC-seq, has decreased, and the complex structure and relatively intricate functions of this gene family in plant growth and development will gradually be elucidated. 5 Conclusion To sum up, our study identified ARID-HMG-related proteins in citrus and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships, chromosome distribution, and protein interaction network construction based on RNA-seq analysis and transgenic functional validation. We specifically investigated the role of the FhARID1 gene and it is highly likely that FhARID1 is not the sole regulatory factor of FhRWP . Loss of function resulted in abnormal proliferation of axillary buds, while overexpression failed to produce visible phenotypes, which further supports the notion that this gene may participate in complex formation rather than acting alone. We also discovered that FhARID1 undergoes CK2-mediated phosphorylation, laying the groundwork for further understanding the function of ARID-HMG-related proteins.
