    "full_text": "Although DNA binding with one finger (Dof) constitutes a crucial plant-specific family of transcription factors (TFs) that plays important roles in a wide range of biological processes, the molecular mechanisms underlying Dof regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in plants remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized 28 Dof genes ( FhDof1 - FhDof28 ) from the ‘Hongkong’ kumquat ( Fortunella hindsii ) cultivar genome. Promoter analysis and transcriptome profiling revealed that four FhDof s — FhDof4 , FhDof9 , FhDof15 , and FhDof16 — may be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis through binding to the flavonoid C-glycosyltransferase ( FhCGT ) promoter. We cloned homologous genes of four FhDof s, designated as FcDof4 , FcDof9 , FcDof15 , FcDof16 , and a homologous gene of FhCGT , designated as FcCGT , from the widely cultivated ‘HuaPi’ kumquat ( F. crassifolia ). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that FcDof4 and FcDof16 were significantly correlated with FcCGT expression during development stages in the ‘HuaPi’ fruit (Pearson’s correlation coefficient > 0.7) and were localized to the nucleus. Results of yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual-luciferase assays indicated that the two FcDofs trigger FcCGT expression by specifically binding to its promoters. Moreover, transient overexpression of FcDof4 and FcDof16 enhances the transcription of structural genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and increases C- glycosylflavonoid content. Our results provide strong evidence that the TFs FcDof4 and FcDof16 promote flavonoid synthesis in kumquat fruit by activating FcCGT expression."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Transcription factors (TFs) are commonly accepted as primary regulators of gene expression through direct interactions with cis -regulatory elements (CREs) in their promoter regions. TFs are involved in myriad physiological processes, including growth, development, and abiotic and biotic stress responses [1,2] . A wide range of TF families with conserved functional domains have been identified in plants, including bHLH, GRF, MYB, WRKY, and NAC [3–8] .",
          "Dof TFs occur in plant species such as mouse-ear cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), rice ( Oryza sativa ), tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ), apple ( Malus domestica ), and grape ( Vitis vinifera ) [9–14] . Dof TFs universally possess a highly conserved N-terminal Dof domain composed of 50–56 amino acid residues. This domain is essential for mediating DNA-protein interactions by directly binding to a specific CRE in the promoter of target genes, as well as by interacting with other proteins such as teosinte branched1/cincinnata/proliferating cell factor 14 (TCP14) and ethylene-responsive element binding factor 19 (ERF19) [15–18] . Unlike the N-terminus, the amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of Dof proteins is highly variable and functions as a transcriptional regulatory domain that activates or represses the expression of target genes in a cellular context [16] . Dof TFs have been shown to participate in a diverse array of biological processes in plants, including growth, development, fruit ripening, metabolic regulation, and expression of an assortment of stress-responsive genes [12,16,19–26] .",
          "Flavonoids are natural substances present in a variety of dietary sources, such as fruits, berries, and nuts, and they are associated with numerous biological functions [27,28] . Research on flavonoid biosynthesis has demonstrated that individual TFs or sets of TFs are often involved in the production of speciﬁc classes of ﬂavonoid compounds [29–32] . For example, the synthesis of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins is regulated by different MYB-bHLH-WDR (MBW) TF complexes. Previous studies have shown that the transcriptional regulation of ﬂavonol biosynthesis is associated with a group of R2R3-MYB TFs that control the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes. Flavanones and flavones are the primary components of many commercial fruits, including those produced from kumquat and citrus fruits [33,34] . However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of flavanone and flavone in plants remain largely unknown.",
          "The elliptically shaped fruits produced by kumquat plants ( Fortunella spp.), a close relative of Citrus spp., are often eaten fresh but may also be candied or preserved in sugary sirups. Unlike most other plants, which contain high concentrations of proanthocyanins, anthocyanins, and flavonols, kumquat fruits contain large amounts of flavanones and flavones. These occur primarily in the form of C/O -glycosides, such as mono- C -glucosides [e.g., isovitexin (6- C -glucosylapigenin) and vitexin (8- C -glucosylapigenin)], di- C -glucosides [e.g., 3′,5′-di- C -β-glucosylphloretin, vicenin-2 (6,8-di- C -glucosylapigenin)], C -neohesperidosides [e.g., rhamnosyl-α-1,2-glucoses , margaritene (8- C -neohesperidosyl acacetin), 8- C -neohesperidosyl apigenin], and O -neohesperidosides (e.g., rhoifolin [7- O -neohesperidosyl apigenin] and fortunellin [7- O -neohesperidosyl acacetin]) [33,34] . Of the C/O -glycosides, C -glycosylflavonoids especially have received an inordinate amount of research attention due to the various biological activities in which they are engaged [35–37] . Recently, a C- glycosyltransferase (CGT) was reported to catalyze the formation of C -glucosylflavonoids in kumquats, leading to the proposal of a partial pathway for C -glycosylflavonoid biosynthesis [38] ( Fig. 1 ).",
          "A previous report revealed that AtDOF4.2 influences the accumulation of flavonoids and the expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, suggesting that Dof TFs could be key regulators of flavonoid production [22] . However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis by Dofs, particularly for flavanones and flavones. The fruit of kumquats, as well as that of citrus plants, is considered an ideal model for exploring the transcriptional regulatory networks of flavones and flavanones. To explore these processes in greater detail, we identified 28 Dof genes in the kumquat genome and analyzed their expression using transcriptome data and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Two Dof genes were capable of activating CGT expression by directly targeting the promoter. In addition, transient overexpression of these two Dof s was found to promote flavonoid biosynthetic gene expression and increase C -glycosylflavonoid content in kumquat fruit . These findings add to our understanding of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis and will aid in the development of transgenic kumquat and citrus cultivars with specialized C -glycosylflavonoid components."

Ultimately, 28 FhDof genes were characterized in kumquat, 25 of which encoded a single Dof protein ( FhDof6 , FhDof20 , and FhDof26 had multiple Dof transcripts). Information regarding the FhDof genes and their encoded proteins is presented in Table S2 . These Dofs varied in length (ranging between 172 and 495 aa residues) as well as molecular weight (19.40–54.60 kDa) and pI (5.37–9.38).

Overall, 10 of the 15 groups (I, V, VI, VII, VIII, XI, X, XII, XIV, and XV) are common among the three plants ( Fig. 2 ), suggesting that these Dof genes are highly conserved across species. Neither group IV nor group XIII contained the Dof genes found in F. hindsii and C. sinensis , suggesting that they are probably dispensable in those plants, whereas these genes might play specific roles in A. thaliana . Notably, groups II, III, and XI were species-specific to F. hindsii and C. sinensis .",

Based on intron and exon numbers, the gene structure of FhDof genes ( Fig. 3 B ) could largely be divided into two distinct categories: category 1 (1 exon) and category 2 (2 exons/1 intron). Members of groups II, III, V, VI, VII, VIII, and XI belonged to only category 1, whereas members of groups IX, X, and XIV belonged to only category 2. Members of the other groups fell into both categories.",
              "In total, 10 distinct motifs (motif1–motif10) were identified in the FhDof proteins ( Fig. 3 C). Motif1, which occurs in all FhDof proteins, is very similar to the conserved Dof domain (PF02701 and PS50884). As expected, most of the closely related FhDofs had common motif compositions, indicating that the FhDof proteins within the same group might be functionally similar. Motif2, motif4, motif5, and motif7 were specific to group I, whereas motif9 was common to all members of group XV (with the exception of FhDof12). Motif8 was common to only the members of group IX. Overall, we found that the N-terminal domains of the FhDof proteins were more highly conserved than the C-terminal domains. This is most likely because the N-terminal Dof domain normally functions as a DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD) that recognizes a highly conserved CRE, whereas the C-terminus plays multiple roles in transactivation or interactions with other regulatory proteins involved in numerous biological processes. Therefore, the C-terminal diversity of FhDof proteins is likely a result of functional diversification."

The results indicated that the FcDof4-GFP and FcDof16-GFP fusion proteins almost fully overlapped with the nuclear localization marker with RFP fluorescent signals, whereas for the control vector, the GFP signal was more evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the epidermal cells. These findings suggest that FcDof4 and FcDof16 are localized in the nucleus."

A Y1H assay was performed to determine whether FcDof4 and FcDof16 bind to the promoter fragment of FcCGT . Yeast cells harboring both bait and prey plasmids were grown on selective medium containing 200 ng/mL AbA ( Fig. 6 B). The results of the assay indicated that FcDofs can interact with FcCGT promoters in yeast.",
              "Next, we conducted EMSA assays to investigate whether FcDof4 and FcDof16 could bind directly to CRE (5′-AAAAG-3′) in the FcCGT promoter region ( Fig. 6 A and C). Incubation of the FcDof recombinant proteins with the “Probe” significantly reduced migration of the protein-probe band, suggesting that the FcDofs were binding to the labeled probe. Moreover, addition of the “Competitor” probe to the mixture greatly inhibited binding of the “Probe” with the FcDof proteins, indicating that the “Competitor” probe was able to compete with the binding of FcDofs to the “Probe”. Finally, the DNA band was not observed when the protein was incubated with the “m Probe” probe ( Fig. 6 C). Thus, we concluded that FcDof4 and FcDof16 specifically recognize and directly bind to CRE (5′-AAAAG-3′) in the FcCGT promoter region.",
              "These results show that FcDofs interact with FcCGT promoters by binding directly to the 5′-AAAAG-3′ motif. However, whether FcDofs are transcriptional repressors or activators remains to be determined. We performed a dual-luciferase assay by inserting the promoter fragment ( Fig. 6 D) of FcCGT into pGreen II 0800-LUC as the reporter vector and introduced FcDof s into pGreenII 62-SK as the effector vector [42] . The reporter vector was co-transformed, with or without the effector vector, into tobacco protoplasts. FcCGT expression was 2.3- and 1.7-fold higher in the presence of FcDof4 and FcDof16 , respectively, than in the negative control (empty vector, pGreen II 0800-LUC) ( Fig. 6 D). Thus, we conclude that FcDofs function as transcriptional activators."

              "Because it is difficult to obtain stable transgenic lines in kumquat plants, a transient expression system was employed to achieve overexpression FcDof s in the peels of the ‘Huapi’ kumquat to further analyze gene function, an approach that has previously been used successfully in citrus fruits [48,49] . Kumquat fruits at 150 DAB were used as the source material because they contain low FcDof s transcript levels ( Fig. 4 B). The results showed that, when compared to the control (empty vector), overexpression of FcDof4 and FcDof16 clearly enhanced the expression of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis, albeit to varying extents, 5 d after infiltration ( Fig. 7 A). Relative to the control, 4 and 5 of the 5 genes analyzed exhibited significantly higher levels of expression in the FcDof4 and FcDof16 overexpression lines, respectively. Compared to other genes, FcCGT was greatly increased in the overexpression lines, which is in accordance with the interaction between FcDof4, FcDof16, and the promoters of FcCGT .",

The C -glycoside content increased more significantly than did the O -glycoside content in FcDof -overexpressing cells ( Fig. 7 B). Overexpression of FcDof4 and FcDof16 resulted in approximately 29% and 18% increases, respectively, in total flavonoid content. These results provide direct evidence that FcDof4 and FcDof16 function as positive regulators of flavonoid biosynthesis, enhancing C -glycosylflavonoid biosynthesis by activating FcCGT transcription."

          "Dof genes comprise a classic family of plant-specific TFs associated with a broad spectrum of biological functions [12,23,50–53] . However, to date, research on flavonoid biosynthesis regulation by Dofs in plants is lacking, especially in high-value commercial fruit species. Compared with 28 FhDof genes in the kumquat genome ( Table S2 ), a comparable number of Dof s have been identified in grape (25 Dof s), C. sinensis (28 Dof s) and rice (30 Dof s), although the number of Dof s was greater in tomato (34 Dof s), A. thaliana (36 Dof s), poplar ( Populus trichocarpa , 41 Dof s), apple (60 Dof s), Chinese cabbage ( Brassica rapa , 76 Dof s), and wheat ( Triticum aestivum, 96 Dof s) [9–14,54–56] . Such differences in the number of members within the Dof gene family between different plant species can be associated with multiple mechanisms. Previous studies have suggested that the majority of Dof genes are derived from segmental and tandem duplication, such as in apple, cassava ( Manihot esculenta ), and tomato [9,11,57] . Moreover, a comparison of the Dof gene family among poplar, A. thaliana , and rice revealed that the fate of the duplicated genes after duplication events is driven by Darwinian positive selection, purifying selection, translocations, and domain co-option [55] .",
          "Consistent with the results of previous studies [11,54] , we found that all FhDofs possessed a classic N-terminal Dof domain ( Fig. S1 ) but were highly diverse in the C-terminus, possibly due to the diversity of protein-protein interactions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 33 FhDof proteins encoded by the 28 genes fell into 13 of the 15 different groups ( Fig. 2 ). As expected, the majority of closely associated members in the phylogenetic tree possessed common motif compositions and exon–intron organization, suggesting functional similarity among the Dof proteins. Generally, the proteins grouped into a clade had similar functions and gene structures and might have evolved from a recent common ancestor.",
          "Over the past several years, many TFs have been found to be involved in the biosynthesis of flavonols and anthocyanins, including the bHLH, R2R3-MYB, WDR, and MBW complexes [27,29–32] . Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of flavone and flavanone biosynthesis differs from that of proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, and flavonols, although all are synthesized through similar early biosynthetic pathways. Because they are unable to synthesize flavonols and anthocyanins, kumquat plants, along with several citrus species, represent an ideal model for researching the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of flavones and flavanones in fruit. Flavonoids normally accumulate in kumquat fruits as O / C -glycosides. C -glycosylflavonoids are stable to hydrolysis, have biological activity in plants, and can also serve as dietary supplements. In this study, we analyzed the promoters of five genes ( CHS1 , CHS2 , CHI , CHIL , and CGT ) involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in kumquats and found that only the CGT promoter sequence had a CRE of Dof TFs ( Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation analysis of FcCGT and FcDof s expression indicated that FcDof4 and FcDof16 are likely to play roles in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway ( Fig. 4 B).",
          "A recent study reported that AtDOF4.2 significantly regulated the expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and thus had a negative effect on flavonoid content [22] . However, Dof TFs have rarely been found to directly bind to and regulate structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. The results of our analysis suggest that FcDof4 and FcDof16 may trigger FcCGT expression by directly targeting the promoter, as indicated by the Y1H, EMSA, and dual-luciferase assays, implying that they may play positive roles in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis ( Fig. 6 ).",
          "An intriguing question elicited by our findings is why kumquat plants use two Dofs to activate a single FcCGT gene. However, it should be noted that many TFs in plants are derived from individual gene families that regulate the expression of a particular gene. For example, CitERF32 and CitERF33, members of the AP2/ERF family, activate CHIL gene expression by specifically binding to the CRE in its promoter, thereby enhancing flavonoid accumulation [58] . Moreover, the results of earlier studies indicate that Dof TFs can interact with other TFs, such as ERF, bZIP, MYB, TCP, and ZFP, and are subsequently involved in multiple biological processes, including seed germination and development, ﬂoral organ abscission, hormone signal transduction, and abiotic and biotic stress responses [12,15–17,21,59–62] . As such, we speculate that although FcDof4 and FcDof16 appear to play overlapping roles in the positive regulation of FcCGT expression and increase in flavonoid content, it is possible that they are involved in distinctive regulatory networks, but procuring evidence in support of this conjecture requires further investigation. The transient expression of FcDof4 and FcDof16 prompted the accumulation of C -glycosylflavonoids rather than O -glycosyl ( Fig. 7 ), providing a unique opportunity to cultivate kumquat plants with specific flavonoids.",
          "In conclusion, we characterized 28 Dof genes in the kumquat genome and found that two specific Dof s were capable of activating the expression of CGT by binding directly to its promoter. In addition, overexpression of the two Dof s significantly enhanced C -glycosylflavonoid accumulation. Our findings provide further insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying flavonoid synthesis in plants."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Transcription factors (TFs) are commonly accepted as primary regulators of gene expression through direct interactions with cis -regulatory elements (CREs) in their promoter regions. TFs are involved in myriad physiological processes, including growth, development, and abiotic and biotic stress responses [1,2] . A wide range of TF families with conserved functional domains have been identified in plants, including bHLH, GRF, MYB, WRKY, and NAC [3–8] . Dof TFs occur in plant species such as mouse-ear cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), rice ( Oryza sativa ), tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ), apple ( Malus domestica ), and grape ( Vitis vinifera ) [9–14] . Dof TFs universally possess a highly conserved N-terminal Dof domain composed of 50–56 amino acid residues. This domain is essential for mediating DNA-protein interactions by directly binding to a specific CRE in the promoter of target genes, as well as by interacting with other proteins such as teosinte branched1/cincinnata/proliferating cell factor 14 (TCP14) and ethylene-responsive element binding factor 19 (ERF19) [15–18] . Unlike the N-terminus, the amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of Dof proteins is highly variable and functions as a transcriptional regulatory domain that activates or represses the expression of target genes in a cellular context [16] . Dof TFs have been shown to participate in a diverse array of biological processes in plants, including growth, development, fruit ripening, metabolic regulation, and expression of an assortment of stress-responsive genes [12,16,19–26] . Flavonoids are natural substances present in a variety of dietary sources, such as fruits, berries, and nuts, and they are associated with numerous biological functions [27,28] . Research on flavonoid biosynthesis has demonstrated that individual TFs or sets of TFs are often involved in the production of speciﬁc classes of ﬂavonoid compounds [29–32] . For example, the synthesis of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins is regulated by different MYB-bHLH-WDR (MBW) TF complexes. Previous studies have shown that the transcriptional regulation of ﬂavonol biosynthesis is associated with a group of R2R3-MYB TFs that control the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes. Flavanones and flavones are the primary components of many commercial fruits, including those produced from kumquat and citrus fruits [33,34] . However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of flavanone and flavone in plants remain largely unknown. The elliptically shaped fruits produced by kumquat plants ( Fortunella spp.), a close relative of Citrus spp., are often eaten fresh but may also be candied or preserved in sugary sirups. Unlike most other plants, which contain high concentrations of proanthocyanins, anthocyanins, and flavonols, kumquat fruits contain large amounts of flavanones and flavones. These occur primarily in the form of C/O -glycosides, such as mono- C -glucosides [e.g., isovitexin (6- C -glucosylapigenin) and vitexin (8- C -glucosylapigenin)], di- C -glucosides [e.g., 3′,5′-di- C -β-glucosylphloretin, vicenin-2 (6,8-di- C -glucosylapigenin)], C -neohesperidosides [e.g., rhamnosyl-α-1,2-glucoses , margaritene (8- C -neohesperidosyl acacetin), 8- C -neohesperidosyl apigenin], and O -neohesperidosides (e.g., rhoifolin [7- O -neohesperidosyl apigenin] and fortunellin [7- O -neohesperidosyl acacetin]) [33,34] . Of the C/O -glycosides, C -glycosylflavonoids especially have received an inordinate amount of research attention due to the various biological activities in which they are engaged [35–37] . Recently, a C- glycosyltransferase (CGT) was reported to catalyze the formation of C -glucosylflavonoids in kumquats, leading to the proposal of a partial pathway for C -glycosylflavonoid biosynthesis [38] ( Fig. 1 ). A previous report revealed that AtDOF4.2 influences the accumulation of flavonoids and the expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, suggesting that Dof TFs could be key regulators of flavonoid production [22] . However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis by Dofs, particularly for flavanones and flavones. The fruit of kumquats, as well as that of citrus plants, is considered an ideal model for exploring the transcriptional regulatory networks of flavones and flavanones. To explore these processes in greater detail, we identified 28 Dof genes in the kumquat genome and analyzed their expression using transcriptome data and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Two Dof genes were capable of activating CGT expression by directly targeting the promoter. In addition, transient overexpression of these two Dof s was found to promote flavonoid biosynthetic gene expression and increase C -glycosylflavonoid content in kumquat fruit . These findings add to our understanding of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis and will aid in the development of transgenic kumquat and citrus cultivars with specialized C -glycosylflavonoid components. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials F. crassifolia cv. ‘Huapi’ trees were cultivated under natural conditions at the Citrus Research Institute in Chongqing, China. Kumquat fruits were harvested from the tress at different ripening stages (15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after full blooming [DAB]). 2.2 Analyses of sequences and phylogenetics The genomic sequences of F. hindsii and Citrus sinensis were downloaded from the Orange Genome Annotation Project ( www.hzau.edu.cn ) [39] . Although Fortunella consists of numerous species, information on the F. hindsii genome is available only through public databases. TBLASTN, using an E -value < 1e –5 , was employed to screen the candidate FhDof CDSs from F. hindsii , with AtDof sequences used as queries. Redundant sequences were removed, and the remaining sequences were checked for the presence of the conserved Dof domains PF02701 and PS50884 using HMMSCAN and PROSITE online software with default parameters. 2.3 Analysis of gene expression Total RNA was extracted using a TaKaRa MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (Takara, Beijing, China) and treated with DNase I to eliminate genomic DNA contaminants. All RNA samples were quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit (Takara, Beijing, China) in a reaction volume of 20 μL. qPCR was performed using TB Green® Premix Ex Taq ™ II (Takara, Beijing, China) on a LightCycler 480 real-time system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The PCR solution, in a total volume of 10 μL, contained 5 μL of 2 × TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNaseH Plus), 50 ng of cDNA, and 0.4 μM of each primer ( Table S1 ). The reaction cycles were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s, 56–58 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 25 s qRT-PCR data were normalized to the cycle threshold value of actin as the internal reference gene [40] , and the relative expression levels of the target genes were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCT method [41] in three independent biological replicates. All primers are listed in Table S1 , unless otherwise noted. 2.4 Subcellular localization assay The coding regions (CDSs) of FcDof s lacking a stop codon were ligated into the pBWA(V)HS-GLosgfp vector, which contains the gene encoding green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP), to create 35 S:FcDof4-GFP and 35 S:FcDof16-GFP. Red fluorescent protein (RFP) mKate fused with the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) MDPKKKRKV was used as a nuclear localization marker. The nuclear localization marker was co-transformed into tobacco leaves ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) with the fusion constructs of FcDof4-GFP, FcDof16-GFP, or control GFP vector by Agrobacterium -mediated infiltration. Following transformation, the tobacco plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod for at least 48 h prior to analysis. The fluorescence signals were detected using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700). Excitation and emission of GFP were set at 561 and 580 nm, respectively, and RFP was set at 488 and 510 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. 2.5 Yeast one-hybrid assay (Y1H) A 300-bp FcCGT promoter fragment was PCR-amplified using primers and ligated into the Sma I and Xho I sites of the pAbAi vector to obtain a bait construct (P1-AbAi). The CDSs of FhDof4 and FhDof16 were amplified with primers and inserted into the Sma I and Xho I restriction sites of the pGADT7 vectors to produce two prey vectors (pGAD-FcDof4 and pGAD-FcDof16). After digestion with Bst BI, the bait constructs were linearized and transformed into yeast strain Y1H Gold to generate reporter strains. Subsequently, the prey construct was introduced into competent reporter strain cells. Yeast cells were grown on SD/-Ura/-Leu medium supplemented with 0 or 200 ng/mL Aureobasidin A (AbA). Both pGAD-p53 + p53-AbAi (positive control) and pGADT7 +P1-AbAi (negative control) were processed in the same manner. 2.6 Dual-luciferase assay The CDSs of FcDof4 and FcDof16 were cloned into pGreenII 62-SK as effector vectors [42] . A 300-bp FcCGT promoter fragment was ligated into the pGreen II 0800-LUC reporter vector [42] . The effector and reporter vectors were introduced into tobacco protoplasts via polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation [43] . The transformed tobacco was maintained at room temperature in the dark for 18 h. The LUC:REN ratio was determined using a Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA). 2.7 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The CDSs of FcDof4 and FcDof16 were inserted into the pMAL-c2X vector and introduced into Rosetta (DE3) cells. The expression of recombinant FcDof4 and FcDof16 was induced by adding IPTG (0.5 mM), and the culture was maintained at 20 °C for 8 h. FcDof proteins were purified using anti-MBP magnetic beads (NEB). A Biotin 3′ End DNA Labeling Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to label a 40-bp single-strand fragment from the FcCGT promoter region. Three types of probes were synthesized, including a “Probe” with biotin at the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide, a “Competitor” that lacked biotin, and an “m Probe” that was mutated from 5′-AAAAG-3′ to 5′-CCCCT-3′ and labeled in the same way. EMSAs were performed in a 20-μL reaction solution containing 10 mM Tris, 500 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT (pH 7.5), 2 μg of recombinant protein, and 1 μL of probe (10 μM) for 30 min at 25 °C. Unlabeled competitors were added in two- or one-fold excess. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to nylon membranes, which were analyzed using a chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module (Thermo Scientific). 2.8 Transient overexpression in kumquat fruit peels The CDSs of FcDof4 and FcDof16 were inserted into the pBI121 vector and introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. Strain EHA105 was cultivated at 28 °C for 16 h in liquid LB medium and then adjusted to a final OD 600 of 0.8 in infiltration medium containing 0.05 M MES, 2 mM Na 3 PO 4 , 0.5% D -glucose, and 0.1 mM acetylsyringone. The A. tumefaciens suspension, containing either FcDof s or empty pBI121 vector as a control, was then injected into the peels. These peels were then placed in the dark for 24 h and subsequently exposed to a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod for 4 d. Flavonoids were extracted from the peels and measured by UPLC Q-TOF. 2.9 Flavonoid extraction and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS conditions Extraction of fruit flavonoids was performed following the procedures outlined in previous studies with minor modifications [44,45] . UPLC was performed with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm UK). Briefly, the mobile phase consisted of 0.01% formic acid solution (A) and acetonitrile (B) using the following gradient program: 0 min, 90% A + 10% B; 2 min, 80% A + 20% B; 5 min, 75% A + 25% B; and 9 min, 65% A + 35% B. The column temperature was set to 40 °C. The compounds were detected using a PAD with an absorption spectrum ranging from 240 to 400 nm. A Xevo G2-S Q-TOF with an electron spray ionization source (Waters MS Technologies, Manchester, UK) was used for the MS analysis. TOF-MS was set at m/z 100–1000. Data were collected using real-time collection (scan time, 0.5 s; interval, 15 s) and processed using Waters UNIFI 1.7 software. 2.10 Accession numbers The sequence data for FcDof4 (accession number MZ666952), FcDof9 (MZ666953), FcDof15 (MZ666954), and FcDof16 (MZ666955) were obtained from GenBank. RNA-seq data were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (PRJNA497956). 3 Results 3.1 Identification of Dof genes in F. hindsii Thirty-six Dof protein sequences from A . thaliana were used to screen Dof genes from the kumquat genome database [39] . After removing redundant sequences, the candidate FhDof proteins were further confirmed based on the presence of the conserved Dof domain (PF02701 and PS50884) using the HMMSCAN and PROSITE online servers. Ultimately, 28 FhDof genes were characterized in kumquat, 25 of which encoded a single Dof protein ( FhDof6 , FhDof20 , and FhDof26 had multiple Dof transcripts). Information regarding the FhDof genes and their encoded proteins is presented in Table S2 . These Dofs varied in length (ranging between 172 and 495 aa residues) as well as molecular weight (19.40–54.60 kDa) and pI (5.37–9.38). From this location information, we can conclude that all FhDofs are localized within the nucleus. Alignment of the FhDofs revealed that the conserved Dof domain, comprising 52 amino acids, is present at the N-terminal of each protein. This Dof domain can specifically bind to the CRE (5′-T/AAAAG-3′) and interacts with other TFs [11] . In addition, an NLS that partly overlapped with the highly conserved Dof domain [46] was identified in FhDofs, demonstrating their nuclear localization ( Fig. S1 ). 3.2 Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of the Dof family Dof protein sequences from A. thaliana , F. hindsii , and C. sinensis were used to generate a phylogenetic tree, the typology of which indicated that 95 Dof proteins are divided into 15 groups, supported by high bootstrap values. Overall, 10 of the 15 groups (I, V, VI, VII, VIII, XI, X, XII, XIV, and XV) are common among the three plants ( Fig. 2 ), suggesting that these Dof genes are highly conserved across species. Neither group IV nor group XIII contained the Dof genes found in F. hindsii and C. sinensis , suggesting that they are probably dispensable in those plants, whereas these genes might play specific roles in A. thaliana . Notably, groups II, III, and XI were species-specific to F. hindsii and C. sinensis . To gain further insight into the diversity of FhDof genes and their encoding proteins, we analyzed exon/intron organization using the GSDS tool and putative motifs with MEME. Based on intron and exon numbers, the gene structure of FhDof genes ( Fig. 3 B ) could largely be divided into two distinct categories: category 1 (1 exon) and category 2 (2 exons/1 intron). Members of groups II, III, V, VI, VII, VIII, and XI belonged to only category 1, whereas members of groups IX, X, and XIV belonged to only category 2. Members of the other groups fell into both categories. In total, 10 distinct motifs (motif1–motif10) were identified in the FhDof proteins ( Fig. 3 C). Motif1, which occurs in all FhDof proteins, is very similar to the conserved Dof domain (PF02701 and PS50884). As expected, most of the closely related FhDofs had common motif compositions, indicating that the FhDof proteins within the same group might be functionally similar. Motif2, motif4, motif5, and motif7 were specific to group I, whereas motif9 was common to all members of group XV (with the exception of FhDof12). Motif8 was common to only the members of group IX. Overall, we found that the N-terminal domains of the FhDof proteins were more highly conserved than the C-terminal domains. This is most likely because the N-terminal Dof domain normally functions as a DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD) that recognizes a highly conserved CRE, whereas the C-terminus plays multiple roles in transactivation or interactions with other regulatory proteins involved in numerous biological processes. Therefore, the C-terminal diversity of FhDof proteins is likely a result of functional diversification. 3.3 Screening FhDof genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis It has been previously reported that Dof TFs directly bind to the CRE 5′-T/AAAAG-3′ of target gene promoters to regulate their expression [16,26] . To determine which FhDof genes potentially function in flavonoid biosynthesis, we first carried out online TF-binding site prediction at the promoter regions (2000 bp) of ﬂavonoid synthesis genes using the website PlantTFDB [47] , including chalcone synthase 1 ( CHS1 ), CHS2 , chalcone isomerase ( CHI ), chalcone isomerase-like ( CHIL ), and CGT . Based on PlantTFDB predictions, only the FhCGT promoter region possessed a CRE for Dof TFs (red circles in Fig. 6 A). The expression patterns of FhDof s and FhCGT in F. hindsii were analyzed using RNA-seq data from 13 different tissues from five organs [39] ( Fig. 4 A). Twenty-four FhDof genes (four were not expressed in any tissue) exhibited diverse expression profiles across multiple tissue types. Analysis of the expression levels of FhDof s and FhCGT revealed that four FhDof s ( FhDof4 , FhDof9 , FhDof15 , and FhDof16 ) were significantly correlated with the expression level of FhCGT in all tissues and organs of F. hindsii (Pearson’s correlation coefficient > 0.7). The expression levels of FhDof4 (R=0.863), FhDof15 (R = 0.809), FhDof9 (R = 0.726), and FhDof16 (R = 0.719) were significantly positively correlated with the expression level of FhCGT . A close relative of the ‘Hongkong’ kumquat cultivar, the ‘Huapi’ kumquat cultivar, is grown worldwide. We cloned FcDof4 , FcDof15 , FcDof9, FcDof16 , and FcCGT from the ‘Huapi’ kumquat. These are homologous to FhDof4 , FhDof15 , FhDof9, FhDof16 , and FhCGT , respectively. To verify the correlation between FcDof s and FcCGT , qRT-PCR analysis was performed during fruit development, the results of which are presented in Fig. 4 B. All genes exhibited high levels of expression at different developmental stages. However, Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed slight differences between FcCGT and FhDof4 (R=0.841), FcCGT and FhDof9 (R=0.560), FcCGT and FhDof15 (R=0.529), and FcCGT and FhDof16 (R=0.782). These results suggest that two Dof genes, FcDof4 and FcDof16 (i.e., R > 0.7), may play key roles in flavonoid synthesis in ‘Huapi’ kumquat. 3.4 Subcellular localization of FcDof4 and FcDof16 To perform subcellular localization analysis, 35S:FcDofs-GFP constructs or control GFP vector was transiently co-expressed with nuclear localization markers in tobacco epidermal cells ( Fig. 5 ). The results indicated that the FcDof4-GFP and FcDof16-GFP fusion proteins almost fully overlapped with the nuclear localization marker with RFP fluorescent signals, whereas for the control vector, the GFP signal was more evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the epidermal cells. These findings suggest that FcDof4 and FcDof16 are localized in the nucleus. 3.5 Transactivation of FcDofs on the FcCGT promoter The promoter sequence of FcCGT carried a putative CRE of Dof TFs (5′-AAAAG-3′) ( Fig. 6 A). A Y1H assay was performed to determine whether FcDof4 and FcDof16 bind to the promoter fragment of FcCGT . Yeast cells harboring both bait and prey plasmids were grown on selective medium containing 200 ng/mL AbA ( Fig. 6 B). The results of the assay indicated that FcDofs can interact with FcCGT promoters in yeast. Next, we conducted EMSA assays to investigate whether FcDof4 and FcDof16 could bind directly to CRE (5′-AAAAG-3′) in the FcCGT promoter region ( Fig. 6 A and C). Incubation of the FcDof recombinant proteins with the “Probe” significantly reduced migration of the protein-probe band, suggesting that the FcDofs were binding to the labeled probe. Moreover, addition of the “Competitor” probe to the mixture greatly inhibited binding of the “Probe” with the FcDof proteins, indicating that the “Competitor” probe was able to compete with the binding of FcDofs to the “Probe”. Finally, the DNA band was not observed when the protein was incubated with the “m Probe” probe ( Fig. 6 C). Thus, we concluded that FcDof4 and FcDof16 specifically recognize and directly bind to CRE (5′-AAAAG-3′) in the FcCGT promoter region. These results show that FcDofs interact with FcCGT promoters by binding directly to the 5′-AAAAG-3′ motif. However, whether FcDofs are transcriptional repressors or activators remains to be determined. We performed a dual-luciferase assay by inserting the promoter fragment ( Fig. 6 D) of FcCGT into pGreen II 0800-LUC as the reporter vector and introduced FcDof s into pGreenII 62-SK as the effector vector [42] . The reporter vector was co-transformed, with or without the effector vector, into tobacco protoplasts. FcCGT expression was 2.3- and 1.7-fold higher in the presence of FcDof4 and FcDof16 , respectively, than in the negative control (empty vector, pGreen II 0800-LUC) ( Fig. 6 D). Thus, we conclude that FcDofs function as transcriptional activators. 3.6 Effects of overexpression of FcDofs in kumquat peels Because it is difficult to obtain stable transgenic lines in kumquat plants, a transient expression system was employed to achieve overexpression FcDof s in the peels of the ‘Huapi’ kumquat to further analyze gene function, an approach that has previously been used successfully in citrus fruits [48,49] . Kumquat fruits at 150 DAB were used as the source material because they contain low FcDof s transcript levels ( Fig. 4 B). The results showed that, when compared to the control (empty vector), overexpression of FcDof4 and FcDof16 clearly enhanced the expression of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis, albeit to varying extents, 5 d after infiltration ( Fig. 7 A). Relative to the control, 4 and 5 of the 5 genes analyzed exhibited significantly higher levels of expression in the FcDof4 and FcDof16 overexpression lines, respectively. Compared to other genes, FcCGT was greatly increased in the overexpression lines, which is in accordance with the interaction between FcDof4, FcDof16, and the promoters of FcCGT . Vicenin-2, 3′,5′-di- C -β-glucopyranosylphloretin, 8- C -neohesperidosyl apigenin, margaritene, rhoifolin, and fortunellin were found to be the main flavonoids in the FcDof4 and FcDof16 overexpression lines. The C -glycoside content increased more significantly than did the O -glycoside content in FcDof -overexpressing cells ( Fig. 7 B). Overexpression of FcDof4 and FcDof16 resulted in approximately 29% and 18% increases, respectively, in total flavonoid content. These results provide direct evidence that FcDof4 and FcDof16 function as positive regulators of flavonoid biosynthesis, enhancing C -glycosylflavonoid biosynthesis by activating FcCGT transcription. 4 Discussion Dof genes comprise a classic family of plant-specific TFs associated with a broad spectrum of biological functions [12,23,50–53] . However, to date, research on flavonoid biosynthesis regulation by Dofs in plants is lacking, especially in high-value commercial fruit species. Compared with 28 FhDof genes in the kumquat genome ( Table S2 ), a comparable number of Dof s have been identified in grape (25 Dof s), C. sinensis (28 Dof s) and rice (30 Dof s), although the number of Dof s was greater in tomato (34 Dof s), A. thaliana (36 Dof s), poplar ( Populus trichocarpa , 41 Dof s), apple (60 Dof s), Chinese cabbage ( Brassica rapa , 76 Dof s), and wheat ( Triticum aestivum, 96 Dof s) [9–14,54–56] . Such differences in the number of members within the Dof gene family between different plant species can be associated with multiple mechanisms. Previous studies have suggested that the majority of Dof genes are derived from segmental and tandem duplication, such as in apple, cassava ( Manihot esculenta ), and tomato [9,11,57] . Moreover, a comparison of the Dof gene family among poplar, A. thaliana , and rice revealed that the fate of the duplicated genes after duplication events is driven by Darwinian positive selection, purifying selection, translocations, and domain co-option [55] . Consistent with the results of previous studies [11,54] , we found that all FhDofs possessed a classic N-terminal Dof domain ( Fig. S1 ) but were highly diverse in the C-terminus, possibly due to the diversity of protein-protein interactions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 33 FhDof proteins encoded by the 28 genes fell into 13 of the 15 different groups ( Fig. 2 ). As expected, the majority of closely associated members in the phylogenetic tree possessed common motif compositions and exon–intron organization, suggesting functional similarity among the Dof proteins. Generally, the proteins grouped into a clade had similar functions and gene structures and might have evolved from a recent common ancestor. Over the past several years, many TFs have been found to be involved in the biosynthesis of flavonols and anthocyanins, including the bHLH, R2R3-MYB, WDR, and MBW complexes [27,29–32] . Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of flavone and flavanone biosynthesis differs from that of proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, and flavonols, although all are synthesized through similar early biosynthetic pathways. Because they are unable to synthesize flavonols and anthocyanins, kumquat plants, along with several citrus species, represent an ideal model for researching the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of flavones and flavanones in fruit. Flavonoids normally accumulate in kumquat fruits as O / C -glycosides. C -glycosylflavonoids are stable to hydrolysis, have biological activity in plants, and can also serve as dietary supplements. In this study, we analyzed the promoters of five genes ( CHS1 , CHS2 , CHI , CHIL , and CGT ) involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in kumquats and found that only the CGT promoter sequence had a CRE of Dof TFs ( Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation analysis of FcCGT and FcDof s expression indicated that FcDof4 and FcDof16 are likely to play roles in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway ( Fig. 4 B). A recent study reported that AtDOF4.2 significantly regulated the expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and thus had a negative effect on flavonoid content [22] . However, Dof TFs have rarely been found to directly bind to and regulate structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. The results of our analysis suggest that FcDof4 and FcDof16 may trigger FcCGT expression by directly targeting the promoter, as indicated by the Y1H, EMSA, and dual-luciferase assays, implying that they may play positive roles in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis ( Fig. 6 ). An intriguing question elicited by our findings is why kumquat plants use two Dofs to activate a single FcCGT gene. However, it should be noted that many TFs in plants are derived from individual gene families that regulate the expression of a particular gene. For example, CitERF32 and CitERF33, members of the AP2/ERF family, activate CHIL gene expression by specifically binding to the CRE in its promoter, thereby enhancing flavonoid accumulation [58] . Moreover, the results of earlier studies indicate that Dof TFs can interact with other TFs, such as ERF, bZIP, MYB, TCP, and ZFP, and are subsequently involved in multiple biological processes, including seed germination and development, ﬂoral organ abscission, hormone signal transduction, and abiotic and biotic stress responses [12,15–17,21,59–62] . As such, we speculate that although FcDof4 and FcDof16 appear to play overlapping roles in the positive regulation of FcCGT expression and increase in flavonoid content, it is possible that they are involved in distinctive regulatory networks, but procuring evidence in support of this conjecture requires further investigation. The transient expression of FcDof4 and FcDof16 prompted the accumulation of C -glycosylflavonoids rather than O -glycosyl ( Fig. 7 ), providing a unique opportunity to cultivate kumquat plants with specific flavonoids. In conclusion, we characterized 28 Dof genes in the kumquat genome and found that two specific Dof s were capable of activating the expression of CGT by binding directly to its promoter. In addition, overexpression of the two Dof s significantly enhanced C -glycosylflavonoid accumulation. Our findings provide further insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying flavonoid synthesis in plants. Author contributions X. L. and M. Z. designed the study. X. L. and Y.
