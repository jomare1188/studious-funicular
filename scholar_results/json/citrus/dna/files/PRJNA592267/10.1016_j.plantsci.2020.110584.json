    "full_text": "As one of the subtropical and tropical fruit trees, Citrus sinensis is sensitive to cold stress. However, most transcription factors (TFs) that regulate cold tolerance in citrus have not yet been reported. A phytochrome-interacting transcription factor (PIF) gene ( CsPIF8 ) in citrus was significantly upregulated under cold stress. Overexpression of CsPIF8 increased cold tolerance in transgenic tomato plants and grapefruit callus, whereas virus-induced gene silencing-mediated suppression of PIF8 increased cold sensitivity in seedlings of Poncirus trifoliata . Superoxide dismutase (SOD) reduces the superoxide anion (O 2 − ) level to enhance cold tolerance in plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing, yeast one hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift and dual luciferase assays showed that CsPIF8 directly bound the E-box (CANNTG) of CsSOD promoter and activated the promoter of CsSOD . Furthermore, the expression level of CsSOD and CsSOD activity were significantly increased, whereas the level of O 2 − was significantly reduced in the transgenic lines. The Poncirus trifoliata seedlings with VIGS-mediated suppression of PIF8 exhibited the opposite effects. These results have shown that CsPIF8 improved cold tolerance in citrus through regulating the expression level of SOD and SOD activity. These findings may provide novel insights into the regulation of PIF8 in the response to cold stress in citrus."

          "Temperature is a primary factor limiting plant production and geographical location in the world [ 1 ]. Cold stress affects the cell membrane integrity, stability of protein complexes and photosynthetic efficiency [ 2 ]. In response to cold stress, more and more crops in temperate climates, such as temperate japonica rice ( Oryza sativa L. ), maize ( Zea mays L. ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ), have been bred to improve freezing tolerance by understanding the cold acclimation mechanisms [ 3–5 ]. Sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ) contributes to more than half of the citrus production all over the world. However, cold sensitivity is a major factor limiting the sweet orange industry. Due to the lack of known cold tolerance mechanism in cultivated citrus, the production of sweet orange is limited under cold conditions [ 6 ].",
          "Antioxidant enzymes play an important role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated during stresses from living cells [ 7 ]. In plant cells, superoxide anion (O 2 − ), one of the ROS, is continuously produced in response to various stresses, including cold stress [ 8 ]. Superoxidase dismutase (SOD) is one of the important endogenous antioxidant enzymes in the plants that can scavenge O 2 − [ 9 , 10 ]. Overexpression of PaSOD enhanced cold tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana [ 11 ]. SOD activity in branch of almond was positively related to its tolerance to cold [ 12 ]. Therefore, improving SOD activity has been regarded as one of the important strategies in breeding programs.",
          "Transcription factors (TFs) play an important role in controlling target gene transcription by binding with conserved domain of the promoters [ 13 ]. Thus, characterization of TFs in response to stresses is a key step to understand the molecular mechanism of stress response and improve stress tolerance. The basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) TFs contain a total of 21 subfamilies in Arabidopsis [ 14 , 15 ]. The basic region of bHLHs is used for DNA binding and allows the bHLH protein to bind the conserved domain E-box (5′-CANNTG-3′) [ 16 , 17 ]. As the 15th subfamily of bHLH TFs, phytochrome-interacting transcription factors (PIFs) contain one or more phytochrome protein binding motifs. So far, 8 PIFs in plants have been identified [ 18 ]. PIFs were reported to be involved in the processes of fruit color formation, leaf senescence, hypocotyl-specific growth as well as circadian control in plants [ 19–22 ]. However, to our knowledge, the physiological roles and regulatory functions of PIFs in citrus are still poorly understood.",
          "Thus, this study was aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a transcription factor CsPIF8 in response to cold treatment in citrus plants. Our results have, for the first time, demonstrated that CsPIF8 may positively regulate cold tolerance in citrus through regulating the CsSOD gene expression and SOD activity."

              "The changes of EL and MDA levels indicated that TRV-PtrPIF8 plants suffered serious injury than TRV plants ( Fig. 6 B–C). Besides, photosynthesis capacities and Fv/Fm ratios of TRV-PtrPIF8 plants were similar to the control plants under normal conditions. Fv/Fm ratio in the TRV-PtrPIF8 lines was lower than TRV plants ( Fig. 6 D–F). These data indicate that silencing of PtrPIF8 increased cold sensitivity of the Poncirus trifoliata plants."

Totals of 8212, 7923, 6365 and 5186 peaks (FDR < 0.001) showed altered binding levels in the two replicates from the two lines ( Fig.7 A, Table S3). The most binding sites of CsPIF8 were located in the 2-kb region upstream of the TSS ( Fig. 7 B). The CsPIF8 binding sites within promoter regions that were located upstream and within 2-kb of the TSS were further analyzed by MEME to identify the conserved motif ( Fig. 7 C). One conserved motif (C (A/T) CG(T/A)G) was found to be present in 1002 sites, with 623 sites in positive strand and 379 sites in negative strand ( Fig. 7 C). Integrative genomic viewer (IGV) images showed that one (Cs7g19240.1) of the target genes of CsPIF8 was located in chromosome 7 encoding SOD in citrus. Moreover, the CsSOD promoter contained CACGTG and CACTTG domains ( Fig. 7 D), also indicating that it is a potential target of CsPIF8."

When ChIP-DNA from transgenic callus line and WT callus was amplified with the primers of pCsSOD (pSOD-1, pSOD-2 and pSOD-3), two DNA-bands containing E-box element were detected in transgenic callus line, whereas not detected in the WT callus ChIP-DNA ( Fig. 8 E). There was no band when the primers that could not amplify E-box element were used in WT callus and transgenic callus line ChIP-DNA ( Fig. 8 E). Moreover, as shown in EMSA, a DNA-protein complex with reduced migration was observed. Besides, the DNA-protein complex was stable when the 30× mutated probe was added ( Fig. 8 F), indicating that CsPIF8 bound directly to the E-box element of pCsSOD."

The transgenic lines of citrus callus and tomato plants exhibited higher levels of SOD expression and SOD activities than the WT under cold treatments ( Fig. 9 A, B, D, E).

          "It is known that TFs function by regulating downstream target genes involved in plant cold stress responses. For example, MaNAC1 was bound by MaICE1 in response to cold stress in banana [ 42 ], CdERF1 enhanced cold tolerance by activating stress-related genes, EARLI1 , PER71 and LTP in Arabidopsis [ 43 ]. In this study, the transgenic lines of CsPIF8 were found to have higher growth rates and lower levels of EL and MDA. These results suggested that transgenic lines suffered lighter injury than WT. Moreover, knockdown of the PIF8 in the seedlings of Poncirus trifoliata showed decreased cold tolerance compared to the control. Furthermore, it was found that CsPIF8 directly bound a stress-related gene CsSOD to enhance cold tolerance in citrus. These results indicated that CsPIF8 is a positive regulator of cold tolerance.",
          "As a subfamily of the bHLH transcription factors, PIFs interact with the active prolonged red light (Pfr) conformer of the phytochrome, suggesting that PIFs are key components of phytochrome signal transduction and regulate the target genes by binding the E-box in the gene promoters [ 44 ]. For example, PIF3 was found to transduce phytochrome signals to the genes involved in the early seedling de-etiolation process by binding the conserved domain E-box in the promoters of key photo-responsive circadian oscillator genes, CCA1 and LHY [ 45 ]. Furthermore, PIF7, together with PIF3 and PIF4, was reported to be involved in seedling de-etiolation via regulating responses to Pfr through binding the E-box of phytochrome B gene ( phyB ) promoter [ 18 ]. As a member of PIFs , CsPIF8 also contained the APB motif sequence at its N terminus, which has been shown to be crucial for mediating the interaction with phyB . Besides, CsPIF8 was found to play a role in cold tolerance in citrus. Thus, it might imply correlated effects of cold stress and response to light in citrus regarding the regulation of CsPIF8.",
          "It has been reported that SOD encodes the antioxidant enzyme SOD, and SOD plays a pivotal role in cold stress tolerance in plants by clearing O 2 − [ 46–48 ]. For example, overexpression of SOD increased seed germination and seedling salt tolerance of Arabidopsis [ 49 ]. SOD regulation is a complicated process, including regulation of TFs in transcriptional level, and microRNAs in posttranscriptional and translational levels. For example, the TF AhNAC3 enhanced water stress tolerance by increasing SOD activity to scavenge O 2 − [ 50 ]. Posttranscriptional induction of SOD was mediated by miR398 under stress conditions in Arabidopsis [ 51 ]. In our study, results from ChIP-seq, Y1H, EMSA and dual LUC assay identified CsSOD as one of the target genes of CsPIF8. The overexpressing lines showed higher SOD expression levels and SOD activities, and less O 2 − accumulation compared to the WT after the cold treatment. We thus propose that PIF8 improves cold tolerance by regulating the expression of SOD and SOD activity in citrus."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Temperature is a primary factor limiting plant production and geographical location in the world [ 1 ]. Cold stress affects the cell membrane integrity, stability of protein complexes and photosynthetic efficiency [ 2 ]. In response to cold stress, more and more crops in temperate climates, such as temperate japonica rice ( Oryza sativa L. ), maize ( Zea mays L. ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ), have been bred to improve freezing tolerance by understanding the cold acclimation mechanisms [ 3–5 ]. Sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ) contributes to more than half of the citrus production all over the world. However, cold sensitivity is a major factor limiting the sweet orange industry. Due to the lack of known cold tolerance mechanism in cultivated citrus, the production of sweet orange is limited under cold conditions [ 6 ]. Antioxidant enzymes play an important role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated during stresses from living cells [ 7 ]. In plant cells, superoxide anion (O 2 − ), one of the ROS, is continuously produced in response to various stresses, including cold stress [ 8 ]. Superoxidase dismutase (SOD) is one of the important endogenous antioxidant enzymes in the plants that can scavenge O 2 − [ 9 , 10 ]. Overexpression of PaSOD enhanced cold tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana [ 11 ]. SOD activity in branch of almond was positively related to its tolerance to cold [ 12 ]. Therefore, improving SOD activity has been regarded as one of the important strategies in breeding programs. Transcription factors (TFs) play an important role in controlling target gene transcription by binding with conserved domain of the promoters [ 13 ]. Thus, characterization of TFs in response to stresses is a key step to understand the molecular mechanism of stress response and improve stress tolerance. The basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) TFs contain a total of 21 subfamilies in Arabidopsis [ 14 , 15 ]. The basic region of bHLHs is used for DNA binding and allows the bHLH protein to bind the conserved domain E-box (5′-CANNTG-3′) [ 16 , 17 ]. As the 15th subfamily of bHLH TFs, phytochrome-interacting transcription factors (PIFs) contain one or more phytochrome protein binding motifs. So far, 8 PIFs in plants have been identified [ 18 ]. PIFs were reported to be involved in the processes of fruit color formation, leaf senescence, hypocotyl-specific growth as well as circadian control in plants [ 19–22 ]. However, to our knowledge, the physiological roles and regulatory functions of PIFs in citrus are still poorly understood. Thus, this study was aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a transcription factor CsPIF8 in response to cold treatment in citrus plants. Our results have, for the first time, demonstrated that CsPIF8 may positively regulate cold tolerance in citrus through regulating the CsSOD gene expression and SOD activity. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials and treatments Healthy adult trees of sweet orange grown in the open field in an experimental nursery under normal field conditions at Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China were used for the study. For transcriptomic profiling of citrus under cold treatments, uniform fresh young shoots of sweet orange were maintained in flasks containing 1 L of sterile deionized water in an incubator (16 h light/8 h dark, at 25 °C) for 24 h. For the cold treatment, the shoots were kept in a growth incubator (4 °C) and the leaves were collected at 0, 6, 24 and 72 h. These samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Two months old seedlings of sweet orange were used to examine expression patterns of CsPIF8 under cold treatments. The seedlings were kept in a plant growth incubator (4 °C), and the leaves were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. These samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. 2.2 RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was isolated using an EASYspin plus plant RNA extraction kit (Aidlab, Beijing, China). cDNA was synthesized using cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo, USA). PCR was conducted using the LightCycler 480II system (Roche Diagnostic, Switzerland). Relative gene expression levels were determined by the 2 −ΔΔCt algorithm [ 23 ]. The Actin gene of citrus and T- Actin gene of tomato were used as internal reference controls [ 24 , 25 ]. The information of primers was shown in Table S4. 2.3 RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bioinformatic analyses For RNA-Seq, the RNAs of sweet orange leaves under low-temperature treatments were sampled. The bioinformatic analyses were performed by Novogene (Wuhan, China), and the clean reads were mapped to the sweet orange database ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/orange/index.php ) [ 26 , 27 ]. Gene expression levels were expressed as fragments per kilo base of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) by a RSEM software [ 28 ]. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using NOISeq method [ 29 ]. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopadia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment of the DEGs were conducted using agriGO toolkit [ 30 ]. 2.4 CsPIF8 cloning and sequence analyses Screened from transcriptomic data, orange1.1t00185 was used in a BLAST search against the sweet orange database. Multiple sequences were aligned using ClustalX software based on the bHLH domains of CsPIF8 and its homologue sequences of other citrus species, including C. sinensis , C. paradisi , C. unshiu , C. reticulata , C. ichangensis , and the relatives of Atlantia buxifolia . A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining method, and bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates was conducted by MEGA 7.0. The sequence alignments were shown by GENEDOC software. 2.5 Determination of subcellular localization Subcellular location of the CsPIF8 protein was determined using citrus mesophyll protoplasts from a pummelo ( C. grandis ) [ 31 ]. The 35S:CsPIF8–GFP fusion vector was created by inserting the coding sequence (CDS) of CsPIF8 without a stop codon into the pM999-35 vector. The 35S:OsGhd7–RFP fusion vector was used to produce the nuclear marker [ 31 ]. A microscope (Leica, Germany) was used to obtain florescence images. 2.6 Analysis of transcriptional activation The full length (PL) of CsPIF8 and its fragments (P1, P2 and P3) were subcloned into pGBKT7 vector (Clontech, Switzerland), resulting in four different recombinants (pGBKT7-FL/F1/F2/F3). The recombinant baits and the negative control, empty vector (pGBKT7) were separately transferred into the yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) strain AH109 cells, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 3 d on SD/-Trp or SD/-Trp/-His/-Ade medium supplemented with 24 mg ml –1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-α-d-galacto-pyranoside (X-α-gal, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). 2.7 Vector construction and plant transformation The amplified CDS of CsPIF8 was ligated onto the PH2GW7 to obtain a CaMV 35S promoter-driven overexpression construct. The construct was transformed into A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 by heat shock. The transformation of Red Marsh grapefruit ( Citrus paradis ) callus and Zhongshu No.5 tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) by Agrobacteria were performed [ 32 ]. The explants were planted into Murashige and Tucker (MT) medium (for citrus callus) containing 50 mM hygromycin B, while Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (for tomato) containing 8 mM hygromycin B. The regenerated plants and callus after the PCR using specific primers and western blot with the antibody against the FLAG tag to determine CsPIF8 protein’s expression; only the plants yielding expected PCR amplicons and CsPIF8 protein hybrid stripe were used as overexpressing lines. 2.8 Western blot of regenerated plants and callus 0.1 g fresh samples of wild type (WT) and overexpressing lines (tomato plants and citrus callus) were used to extract total protein by one-step protein extraction kit (C510004-0020, Sangon Biotech, China) and quantified using BCA (bicinchoninic acid) kit (G3522, Sangon Biotech, China). Protein samples of 40 μg were separated by 12 % SDS-PAGE, and then were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). Subsequently, membranes were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies (1:1,000, TransGen Biotech, China) in the same solution overnight at 4 °C. After washed with TBST solution, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000, TransGen Biotech, China). The gel bands were captured using AmershamTM 696 Imager 600 (GE Healthcare, USA). 2.9 Generation of VIGS citrus plants A 464-bp fragment of PtrPIF8 , which is the same as CsPIF8 , was amplified and inserted into pTRV2 vector to generate a fusion vector. Agrobacteria-mediated transformation of the seeds of trifoliata orange ( Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. ) was performed [ 33 ]. Thirty days later, PCR amplification of DNA from each seedling was conducted using primers to identify transformed lines, and transcript abundance of CsPIF8 in each transformed line was determined by qRT-PCR. 2.10 Cold tolerance assays For cold treatment on Red Marsh grapefruit ( Citrus paradis ) callus, the transgenic Red Marsh and WT callus were firstly planted into MT culture medium for 5 d, before cold treatment for 7 d and 10 d at 4 °C. For cold tolerance assay on tomato plants under growth chamber conditions, the 20 days old seedlings of WT and overexpressing tomato lines were transferred into a cold chamber (4 °C) for 12 h. For cold treatment on the VIGS plants, 25 days old seedlings were transferred into a cold chamber (−2 °C) for 12 h. 2.11 Physiological measurements and histochemical staining The relative growth rate and electrolyte leakage (EL) level in the tested lines were examined by following previous reports [ 34 , 35 ]. The contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and O 2 − , and SOD activity were determined by kits (A003-1 for MDA, A052-1-1 for O 2 − , A001 for SOD, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China) [ 36–38 ]. Total protein contents were measured by enzyme-labeled instrument infinite M2000 (Tecan, Switzerland). The level of O 2 − was also evaluated by histochemical staining with NBT [ 39 ]. IMAGINGPAM chlorophyll fluorimeter and Imaging WinGigE software (Walz, Germany) were used to obtain chlorophyll fluorescence images and Fv/Fm ratios. 2.12 ChIP-Seq and ChIP-PCR analysis The EpiQuik plant chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Epigentek, USA) was used to perform ChIP experiment using WT and 35S:CsPIF8-FLAG (CsPIF8-OX). ChIP-seq was undertaken using two lines of CsPIF8-OX (#24 and #29), ChIPed DNA, WT RM callus and FLAG antibodies (1:1,000, TransGen Biotech, China). Filtered ChIP-seq data were aligned with the sweet orange genome sequence, http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/orange/ using Bowtie2 Version 39. Peak discovery was performed using MACS 44 (Wuhan Genomics Institute, China) according to the threshold: FDR < 0.001. The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) was used to visualize the result of ChIP-seq. Based on the characteristics of TF binding promoter, we selected a 2 kb sequence upstream of transcription start site (TSS) bound by CsPIF8 for conserved domain analysis, which was completed by MEME-ChIP ( http://meme-suite.org/ ). The precipitated DNAs were further analyzed via PCR with specific primers derived from the CsPIF8 target gene CsSOD , which is the same as the SOD in Red Marsh grapefruit ( Citrus paradis ). The raw data from RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were deposited in the GEO database (No. SAMN13418312 and No. PRJNA592267). 2.13 Yeast one-hybrid assay (Y1H) The promoter of CsSOD (pSOD, 1047 bp) bound by CsPIF8 in ChIP-seq was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pAbAi vector, while the CDS of CsPIF8 was transformed into pGADT7 vector. We used the Matchmaker Gold Y1H library screening system (Clontech, CA) to perform Y1H experiment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. SD/-Leu medium containing 400 ng/mL AbA was used to assess growth ability of the yeast cells. 2.14 Dual LUC assay To generate an effector construct, the ORF of CsPIF8 was transformed into the pGreenII 62-SK binary vector, while the promoter fragment of CsSOD was transformed into pGreenII 0800-LUC. Transient gene expression levels in tobacco (N. benthamiana ) leaves were determined by a previous method [ 40 ]. 2.15 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The recombinant vector (CsPIF8-His) was produced and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The promoter fragments containing the E-box elements were labeled with FAM. Wild-type and mutated oligonucleotides were used as competitors. EMSA was performed using the LightShift EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) according to a previous method [ 41 ]. Gel images were captured using AmershamTM 696 Imager 600 (GE Healthcare, USA). 2.16 Data analysis Results were shown as means ± standard deviations (SDs). Data were analysed by ANOVA, followed by LSD test. A value of p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 was considered to be statistically significant or very significant. 3 Results 3.1 Transcriptomic profiling of citrus plants under cold treatments To determine cold stress-induced expression of transcripts and identify cold-responsive genes in sweet orange, we performed RNA-seq analysis on citrus shoots both under normal and cold growing conditions (4 °C for 0, 6, 24 and 72 h). There were a total of 6124 DEGs between the normal and cold treated shoots, with 2314, 2732 and 4074 DEGs for the 6 h, 24 h and 72 h respectively ( Fig. 1 A, Table S1). All the up-regulated DEGs were subjected to KEGG and GO analysis. Pathways showing significant change (Q value ≤ 0.05) induced under cold conditions were identified using the KEGG database ( Fig. 1 B). The up-regulated DEGs were involved in seven enriched pathways: ‘plant-pathogen interaction’, ‘plant hormone signal transduction’, ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’, ‘diterpenoid biosynthesis’, ‘ether lipid metabolism’, ‘alpha-linolenic acid metabolism’ and ‘photosynthesis - antenna proteins’. In the GO database, ‘oxidoreductase activity’, ‘nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity’ and ‘sequence-specific DNA binding’ were the most enriched in the ‘molecular function’ category ( Fig. 1 C). The transcript levels of 68 TFs were significantly different under the cold treatment ( Fig. 1 D, Table S2). These genes were classified into five subgroups ( Fig. 1 D). Subgroup I showed low changes in expression levels early, with a peak expression at 24 h and the levels remaining high at 72 h. In subgroup II, there were the highest expression levels at 6 h, followed by a decrease at 24 h. Subgroup III, the largest subgroup, showed the highest expression levels at 72 h. In subgroup IV, the highest expression level was at 6 h, but lower levels at 24 and 72 h. In subgroup V, the highest level of transcript abundance was at 24 h, followed by a decrease at 72 h. The expression levels of subgroup I were significantly increased, indicating that these genes were induced by cold treatment. One of subgroup I members, orange1.1t00185, exhibited a linear up-regulation by cold treatment. In order to confirm the cold induced regulation of orange1.1t00185 in sweet orange, we examined its transcript levels by qRT-PCR in seedlings under cold treatments. The results showed low changes in expression levels early, with a higher expression at 24 h, a peak at 48 h, with the levels remaining high at 72 h (Fig.S1). However, the function of orange1.1t00185 remains to be determined. 3.2 Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of CsPIF8 The gene orange1.1t00185 encodes a putative protein of 465 amino acids, which contained a conserved bHLH domain and an APB domain. A phylogenetic tree showed the relationship between CsUNE10 and other bHLH TFs from Arabidopsis thaliana and C. sinensis ( Fig. 2 ), in which CsUNE10 was the most closely related to PIF8 from A. thaliana (AT4G00050). Thus, the transcription factor was designated as CsPIF8. In addition, it was found that CsPIF8 shared sequence identity of the bHLH domains with other citrus species, including C. sinensis , C. paradisi , C. unshiu , C. grandis , C. ichangensis , C. reticulata and Atlantia buxifolia (Fig. S2). 3.3 Subcellular distribution and transcriptional activity of CsPIF8 To investigate the subcellular distribution of CsPIF8, the CDS of CsPIF8 without the stop codon was transformed into the 5 ’ end of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. The GFP signal was transiently expressed in citrus mesophyll protoplasts. A nucleus marker gene, fused to mCherry, was co-transformed into citrus mesophyll protoplasts. The fusion protein CsPIF8-GFP was found to be localized exclusively to the nucleus ( Fig. 3 A). Then a GAL4 yeast expression system was used to confirm whether CsPIF8 possessed transcriptional activity. The ORF (PL) and three truncated fragments (P1, P2 and P3) of CsPIF8 were fused to pGBKT7 separately ( Fig. 3 B-C). All of the yeast cells grew well on the SD/-Trp medium, whereas only yeast cells transformed with the effectors containing PL and P2 grew well on the SD/-Trp/-His/-Ade medium supplemented with X-α-gal ( Fig. 3 D). These results demonstrated that CsPIF8 had transcriptional activation activity within P2 region. 3.4 Overexpression of CsPIF8 in citrus callus and tomato plants increased cold tolerance Induction of CsPIF8 by cold stress suggested that CsPIF8 may play an important role in the response to the cold stress. In order to test this hypothesis, CsPIF8 was overexpressed in Red Marsh grapefruit callus. Two transgenic lines #24 and #29 were used to measure relative cold tolerance ( Fig. 4 A). Results showed that the transgenic lines were more tolerant to cold stress than the WT. The relative growth rate of the transgenic lines was significantly higher than the WT in grapefruit callus ( Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the opposite effects were observed in EL and MDA levels ( Fig. 4 C-D). Meanwhile, two transgenic tomato plant lines were used to measure relative cold tolerance ( Fig.5 A). The transgenic lines suffered lighter injury than the WT at 4 °C ( Fig. 5 B). Both EL and MDA levels of #4 and #14 were also significantly lower than the WT under cold treatments ( Fig. 5 C-D). The transgenic lines exhibited similar fluorescence imaging with the WT before cold treatment. However, Fv/Fm ratios in the transgenic lines were higher than the WT under the cold stress ( Fig. 5 E-G). 3.5 Silencing of PIF8 in seedlings of Poncirus trifoliata decreased its cold tolerance To further investigate the role of PIF8 in the response to cold stress, knockdown of PIF8 transcript using VIGS was performed in Poncirus trifoliate . Transcript abundances of PIF8 in the positive plants (TRV-PtrPIF8) were significantly lower (from 3% to 70 %) than the control plants (TRV) (Fig. S2). Meanwhile, TRV-PtrPIF8 plants were less green than TRV plants ( Fig.6 A). The changes of EL and MDA levels indicated that TRV-PtrPIF8 plants suffered serious injury than TRV plants ( Fig. 6 B–C). Besides, photosynthesis capacities and Fv/Fm ratios of TRV-PtrPIF8 plants were similar to the control plants under normal conditions. Fv/Fm ratio in the TRV-PtrPIF8 lines was lower than TRV plants ( Fig. 6 D–F). These data indicate that silencing of PtrPIF8 increased cold sensitivity of the Poncirus trifoliata plants. 3.6 Genomic binding profiling of CsPIF8 in citrus To explore the potential targets of CsPIF8, we conducted ChIP-seq analysis using two transgenic citrus callus lines (#24 and #29) and WT. Totals of 8212, 7923, 6365 and 5186 peaks (FDR < 0.001) showed altered binding levels in the two replicates from the two lines ( Fig.7 A, Table S3). The most binding sites of CsPIF8 were located in the 2-kb region upstream of the TSS ( Fig. 7 B). The CsPIF8 binding sites within promoter regions that were located upstream and within 2-kb of the TSS were further analyzed by MEME to identify the conserved motif ( Fig. 7 C). One conserved motif (C (A/T) CG(T/A)G) was found to be present in 1002 sites, with 623 sites in positive strand and 379 sites in negative strand ( Fig. 7 C). Integrative genomic viewer (IGV) images showed that one (Cs7g19240.1) of the target genes of CsPIF8 was located in chromosome 7 encoding SOD in citrus. Moreover, the CsSOD promoter contained CACGTG and CACTTG domains ( Fig. 7 D), also indicating that it is a potential target of CsPIF8. 3.7 CsPIF8 activated the promoter of CsSOD To verify the binding of CsPIF8 to CsSOD promoter (pCsSOD), a 1047-bp fragment of the promoter of CsSOD bound by CsPIF8 in ChIP-seq was used to perform Y1H assay ( Fig. 8 A), and CsPIF8 was used as the prey. The results showed that the prey and bait (pCsSOD) grew normally ( Fig. 8 B). Dual LUC assay in tobacco plants was performed using CsPIF8 as an effector, and pCsSOD was used as reporters ( Fig. 8 C). It was found that the co-transformation of CsPIF8 and pCsSOD significantly increased the pCsSOD activity ( Fig. 8 D), indicating that CsPIF8 bound and activated the CsSOD promoter. To determine binding characteristics of CsPIF8 to the E-box motif of pCsSOD, ChIP-PCR and EMSA were carried out. In ChIP-PCR experiment, transgenic callus line (CsPIF8-OX) and WT callus input DNA were taken as positive controls. When ChIP-DNA from transgenic callus line and WT callus was amplified with the primers of pCsSOD (pSOD-1, pSOD-2 and pSOD-3), two DNA-bands containing E-box element were detected in transgenic callus line, whereas not detected in the WT callus ChIP-DNA ( Fig. 8 E). There was no band when the primers that could not amplify E-box element were used in WT callus and transgenic callus line ChIP-DNA ( Fig. 8 E). Moreover, as shown in EMSA, a DNA-protein complex with reduced migration was observed. Besides, the DNA-protein complex was stable when the 30× mutated probe was added ( Fig. 8 F), indicating that CsPIF8 bound directly to the E-box element of pCsSOD. 3.8 SOD expression, SOD activity and O 2 − accumulation in transgenic and VIGS lines Since CsPIF8 directly upregulated the activity of CsSOD promoter, we assumed that CsPIF8 may regulate the SOD expression level and SOD activity. We determined SOD expression levels and SOD activities when PIF8 was overexpressed or knocked down. The transgenic lines of citrus callus and tomato plants exhibited higher levels of SOD expression and SOD activities than the WT under cold treatments ( Fig. 9 A, B, D, E). On the contrary, when PIF8 was knocked down, both parameters were significantly lower in the TRV-PtrPIF8 plants compared with the TRV control under cold treatments ( Fig. 9 C, F). Taken together, CsPIF8 increased SOD expression level and SOD activity. Consequently, O 2 − levels in the transgenic citrus callus and tomato lines were significantly lower than that in the WT ( Fig. 9 G, H) in the presence of the cold stress. In contrast, the TRV-PtrPIF8 plants accumulated more O 2 − than the control under cold stress ( Fig. 9 I). Histochemical staining with NBT also reflected the O 2 - levels between the tested lines after cold treatments ( Fig. 9 J, K). These results indicated that O 2 - accumulation was decreased in the overexpressing transgenic lines, but increased in the TRV-PtrPIF8 plants by cold treatments. 4 Discussion It is known that TFs function by regulating downstream target genes involved in plant cold stress responses. For example, MaNAC1 was bound by MaICE1 in response to cold stress in banana [ 42 ], CdERF1 enhanced cold tolerance by activating stress-related genes, EARLI1 , PER71 and LTP in Arabidopsis [ 43 ]. In this study, the transgenic lines of CsPIF8 were found to have higher growth rates and lower levels of EL and MDA. These results suggested that transgenic lines suffered lighter injury than WT. Moreover, knockdown of the PIF8 in the seedlings of Poncirus trifoliata showed decreased cold tolerance compared to the control. Furthermore, it was found that CsPIF8 directly bound a stress-related gene CsSOD to enhance cold tolerance in citrus. These results indicated that CsPIF8 is a positive regulator of cold tolerance. As a subfamily of the bHLH transcription factors, PIFs interact with the active prolonged red light (Pfr) conformer of the phytochrome, suggesting that PIFs are key components of phytochrome signal transduction and regulate the target genes by binding the E-box in the gene promoters [ 44 ]. For example, PIF3 was found to transduce phytochrome signals to the genes involved in the early seedling de-etiolation process by binding the conserved domain E-box in the promoters of key photo-responsive circadian oscillator genes, CCA1 and LHY [ 45 ]. Furthermore, PIF7, together with PIF3 and PIF4, was reported to be involved in seedling de-etiolation via regulating responses to Pfr through binding the E-box of phytochrome B gene ( phyB ) promoter [ 18 ]. As a member of PIFs , CsPIF8 also contained the APB motif sequence at its N terminus, which has been shown to be crucial for mediating the interaction with phyB . Besides, CsPIF8 was found to play a role in cold tolerance in citrus. Thus, it might imply correlated effects of cold stress and response to light in citrus regarding the regulation of CsPIF8. It has been reported that SOD encodes the antioxidant enzyme SOD, and SOD plays a pivotal role in cold stress tolerance in plants by clearing O 2 − [ 46–48 ]. For example, overexpression of SOD increased seed germination and seedling salt tolerance of Arabidopsis [ 49 ]. SOD regulation is a complicated process, including regulation of TFs in transcriptional level, and microRNAs in posttranscriptional and translational levels. For example, the TF AhNAC3 enhanced water stress tolerance by increasing SOD activity to scavenge O 2 − [ 50 ]. Posttranscriptional induction of SOD was mediated by miR398 under stress conditions in Arabidopsis [ 51 ]. In our study, results from ChIP-seq, Y1H, EMSA and dual LUC assay identified CsSOD as one of the target genes of CsPIF8. The overexpressing lines showed higher SOD expression levels and SOD activities, and less O 2 − accumulation compared to the WT after the cold treatment. We thus propose that PIF8 improves cold tolerance by regulating the expression of SOD and SOD activity in citrus. 5 Conclusions In summary, a cold-responsive PIF transcription factor CsPIF8 was identified in sweet orange. The transgenic lines of CsPIF8 with higher growth rate, lower levels of EL and MDA showed increased cold tolerance in comparison with the WT tomato plants and WT grapefruit callus. Moreover, knockdown of the PIF8 in the seedlings of Poncirus trifoliata showed decreased cold tolerance compared to the control. The overexpressing lines showed higher SOD expression levels and SOD activities, and less O 2 − accumulation compared to the WT after the cold treatments. We thus conclude that PIF8 regulates the expression of CsSOD to control SOD activity and O 2 − accumulation. Thus, our findings have provided new insights into understanding the implications of PIF8 in cold tolerance in citrus. Author contributions J.X., Z.H. designed the study.
