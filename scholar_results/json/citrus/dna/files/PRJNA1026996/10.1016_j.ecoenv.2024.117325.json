    "full_text": "Streptomycin (Str) and oxytetracycline (Otc) are widely used antibiotics to manage bacterial diseases in citrus and other crops. However, their impacts on the rhizosphere bacterial assembly and plant physiology are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Str and Otc on the physiology (assimilation, transpiration rate, intracellular CO 2 , and stomatal conductance to water vapor), rhizosphere bacterial assemblages (16S rRNA gene high-throughput amplicon sequencing), and rhizosphere metabolite profiles in healthy Citrus reticulata trees. The results indicated a reduction in photosynthesis after Str and Otc treatments, whereas CO 2 outflow stayed constant. Both antibiotics decreased the culturable numbers of bacteria. Analysis of the microbiome showed changes in relative abundance of bacterial groups, specifically Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, and Streptomyces , in response to the antibiotics. Metabolite profiles changed in streptomycin- and oxytetracycline-treated citrus plants suggesting response to microbe targets or induction of stress responses. This study advances knowledge of antibiotic-driven effects on the rhizosphere microbiome, rhizosphere metabolome, and plant physiology, which is essential for managing plant diseases while safeguarding rhizosphere ecology and long-term plant health."

          "Rhizosphere microbes, living in the narrow zone of soil surrounding plant roots, act as a first line of defense against invading pathogens and play a vital role in plant health by influencing physiological and metabolic processes. The root system releases primary and secondary metabolites, known as root exudates, into the rhizosphere. These exudates serve as carbon/nitrogen substrates, signaling molecules, and chemoattractants for nearby microbes ( Molefe et al., 2023 ). Plants influence the composition of the root microbiome by adjusting the composition of these exudates, which allows them to attract beneficial microbes while repelling harmful ones. Thus, an essential aspect of managing plant diseases is protecting the health of the roots, as the rhizosphere microbes are necessary for plant health ( Ketehouli et al., 2024a, 2024b ). Disrupting this balanced microbial community (eubiosis) through agricultural management practices can interfere with plant health.",
          "Antimicrobials are used in agriculture to treat microbial diseases of plants. However, treatment may affect the beneficial role of a healthy microbiome. Thus, to assess the impact of antimicrobials on plant health, studies are needed that evaluate their effects on the pathogen to be treated, the whole plant microbial community, and the plant itself. Many antibiotics that are currently used in the United States of America for crop production target bacterial diseases of tree fruit crops, specifically apples, pears, stone fruit, and citrus ( Archer and Albrecht, 2023; Batuman et al., 2024 ). The administration of antibiotics to manage plant diseases began in the 1950s ( McManus and Stockwell, 2000 ). However, in recent years, the pervasive use of antibiotics in agriculture has raised concerns about their unintended consequences, such as causing an imbalance in the plant microbial community (also known as dysbiosis). Streptomycin and oxytetracycline, two broad-spectrum antibiotics frequently used to manage tomato, citrus, and other crop diseases, are known for their efficacy in reducing disease severity ( Blaustein et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2023 ). Our study examines the effects of these two antibiotics used to treat Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as citrus greening disease, on citrus plants. This disease, caused by the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus ( C Las), poses a significant risk to the long-term viability of the citrus sector ( Graham et al., 2020; McCollum and Baldwin, 2016 ). The direct administration of antibiotics into the trunks of citrus trees infected with C Las resulted in a notable decrease in HLB symptoms ( Hu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2014 ). While antibiotics may be crucial in controlling plant diseases, their indiscriminate use may inadvertently impact non-target beneficial bacterial communities. This potentially disrupts microbial diversity, metabolic processes, and long-term plant health.",
          "Metabolomics is a developing technique capable of analyzing alterations in metabolism when an organism reacts to an external stimulus, such as a pathogen invasion, chemical use, and environmental stresses. Metabolomics has been employed on citrus to measure the effects of C Las infection on juice of citrus fruits ( Chin et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2023 ) and the impact of feeding by the C Las vector, the Asian citrus psyllid, on citrus leaves ( Chin et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, metabolomics has been utilized to identify a unique set of metabolites in C Las-infected citrus leaves ( Chen et al., 2022 ) and root tissues ( Chen et al., 2022; Padhi et al., 2019 ). Microbiome research on citrus has found that HLB (Huanglongbing) causes alterations in the composition of bacterial communities. Specifically, there is a change in the composition of the overall soil community, with decreases in the populations of Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Rhodanobacter, Sphingobium, and Sphingomonas ( Chen et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2021 ). Chen et al. (2017) have documented comparable findings, noting a reduction in Burkholderia and Bradyrhizobium in sweet orange trees affected by HLB compared to healthy ones. On the other hand, the families Comamonadaceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, and Rhizobiales seem to be more abundant on the roots of infected trees ( Blaustein et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge regarding the metabolic reaction of citrus roots to antibiotic application and its effect on nearby microbial populations. Indeed, plants under abiotic or biotic stress release a variety of metabolites through their roots, which influence the composition and activity of the rhizosphere microbiome. In turn, the rhizosphere microbiome plays a crucial role in nutrient acquisition, plant growth promotion, and defense against pathogens ( de Andrade et al., 2023; Mendes et al., 2013 ). Hence, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of streptomycin and oxytetracycline on Citrus reticulata (US-942) physiology, its root-associated (rhizosphere) bacterial populations, and metabolite profiles."

Immediately prior to sampling, we prepared epiphyte removal buffer (30 mL per sample) by adding 6.75 g of KH 2 PO 4 , 8.75 g of K 2 HPO 4 , and 1 mL of Triton X-100–1 L of sterile water. The buffer was sterilized using a vacuum filter with 0.22 μm pore size. To collect roots and rhizosphere, we used sterile scissors to cut a representative subsection of roots and place a minimum of 500 mg of root tissue into a 50 mL conical tube. 30 mL of epiphyte removal buffer was added to cover the roots, and the sample was immediately put on dry ice, as indicated by ( Simmons et al., 2018 ). We minimized the breaking of roots that could lead to endophytic bacteria being washed out into the rhizosphere. The samples were then kept at −80°C. To separate the rhizosphere from the roots, we thawed the root sample on ice, then vortexed and sonicated the root samples at 4°C for 10 min. The roots were discarded using sterile forceps.

Str reached an 80 % reduction after one day of application, while Otc took a week to be 80 % degraded ( Fig. 1 ). The primary mechanisms for the decomposition of antibiotics are hydrolysis and photolysis. It has been observed that several antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline ( Loftin et al., 2008; Pouliquen et al., 2007 ); penicillin G (D. Li et al., 2008 ), and sulfadiazine ( Yang et al., 2009 ) undergo hydrolysis in the environment. The pH of the environment typically influences hydrolysis processes, as they depend on the ratio of H 3 O + to OH - . Microorganisms may break down xenobiotic compounds such as antibiotics, which are foreign to known enzyme systems, by developing novel metabolic pathways over time ( Top and Springael, 2003 ). We showed that Str and Otc affect the microbial community differently ( Fig. 4 ), which may also affect the degradation of the two antibiotics.",
          "While oxytetracycline and streptomycin application could potentially combat C Las, they may also have detrimental effects on plant physiology and growth, because antibiotic application affects beneficial rhizobacteria, which are known to improve plant health, development, and physiology ( Ketehouli et al., 2024a, 2024b; Martins et al., 2018 ). Daniels (1982) demonstrated that oxytetracycline application via stem injection (0.1 mL at 1–10 mg mL −1 ) in kidney beans' roots and leaves changes the microflora in the rhizoplane. According to our results, the photosynthesis (assimilation) and transpiration of antibiotic-treated plants significantly decreased compared to control plants ( Fig. 2 A-B). Transpiration and photosynthesis are vital for all plants, but they also generate poisonous reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Kapoor et al., 2019 ). Plant metabolic activities may be disturbed when subjected to chemical stress, such as antibiotic exposure ( Khan et al., 2021 ). Plants downregulate photosynthesis, an energy-intensive activity, to save resources and energy. Photosynthesis and transpiration are closely related processes involving water vapor loss through leaves ( Zhu et al., 2010 ). Plants decrease transpiration to conserve water when photosynthesis slows down because of chemical or other stress. This is particularly crucial in scenarios where there is a water shortage or when chemical stress has damaged the plant's capacity to absorb water ( Zhu et al., 2010 ). The decrease in transpiration and photosynthesis is a reaction by plants to deal with stress brought on by antibiotics and preserve vital physiological processes and survival. Understanding the physiological responses of citrus plants to antibiotic exposure is essential to building a foundation for biotechnological methods to enhance the removal of antibiotics from the rhizosphere (phytoremediation) and identify the harmful effects of antibiotics in the environment.",
          "Our study examined the effect of two antibiotics on the culturable bacteria over time. Significant differences were noted in CFU counts on LB-antibiotic-free media. Interestingly, oxytetracycline in the rhizosphere or supplemented on LB medium significantly affected the CFU counts after a week ( Fig. 3 A and C). Streptomycin affected the culturable bacterial growth in nature, not when used as a supplement in LB medium ( Fig. 3 A and B). These results suggest that oxytetracycline inhibits bacteria more than streptomycin. Colinas et al. (1994) examined the impact of antibiotics and combinations of antibiotics (oxytetracycline and penicillin) on the number of CFUs in soil and showed that the exposure to the two compounds led to a 20 % decrease in active CFU counts and a 29 % decrease in overall CFU counts relative to the control value. These results demonstrate the capacity of specific antimicrobial agents to inhibit active CFU counts.",
          "High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed distinct differences in bacterial community structures after antibiotic application ( Fig. 4 ). We detected a variation in the abundance of bacteria in the genera Pseudomonas , Streptomyces , and Agrobacterium . The reduction in the Pseudomonas population (37 % following Str treatment and 50 % following Otc application) indicates that both antibiotics have an adverse effect on this genus. The observed increase in Streptomyces abundance (69 % under Str and 37 % under Otc) suggests that these bacteria may possess more resistance to the antibiotics or derive advantages from decreased competition with Pseudomonas and other sensitive taxa. This enhancement may be related to their involvement in antibiotic production, since some Streptomyces species synthesize antibiotics and may exhibit greater tolerance towards their existence ( Klindworth et al., 2013; Muteeb et al., 2023 ). Other studies have found that oxytetracycline application inhibited plant growth by reducing nutrient uptake, reduced the overall bacterial count in the rhizoplane, and elevated both fungal populations and the number of oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria in the rhizoplane ( Daniels, 1982 ). Ascunce et al. (2019) demonstrated that administering penicillin through trunk injections can impact the bacterial population composition in citrus roots and rhizosphere. Further investigation is needed to study the role of Pseudomonas spp., Streptomyces spp., or Agrobacterium spp. in the rhizosphere and assess their potential in mitigating the adverse effects of antibiotics on citrus trees, particularly as a synthetic microbial community ( Martins et al., 2023 ).",
          "Metabolomics analyses revealed that the top twenty metabolites that were decreased and increased in citrus plants treated with streptomycin and oxytetracycline were distinct, but more similar to their corresponding control plants at the two timepoints. Thus, the stress responses examined are relative to plant condition. The upregulation and downregulation of flavonoids ( Table 2 ) indicate that citrus roots released flavonoids in response to Str. The flavonoid pathway generates a wide range of plant chemicals that serve many purposes, such as providing UV protection, acting as antioxidants, serving as pigments, regulating auxin transport, acting as defense molecules against pathogens, and participating in signaling during symbiosis ( Hassan and Mathesius, 2012 ). In addition, flavonoids modify the soil by functioning as antioxidants and metal chelators. Chelation and reduction of metals can alter the nutrient levels in the soil, which can be particularly significant for the accessibility of phosphorus and iron. One instance is the discovery of an isoflavonoid in the root exudates of Medicago sativa (alfalfa) that can dissolve ferric phosphate. This makes phosphate and iron accessible to the plant ( Hassan and Mathesius, 2012; Masaoka et al., 1993 ). Flavonoids can be synthesized and explicitly released in response to abiotic and biotic signals in the rhizosphere ( Dixon and Paiva, 1995 ).",
          "Terpenoid compounds were downregulated in the rhizosphere of Otc-treated plants. Terpenoids are another vast and varied collection of plant secondary metabolites renowned for their multifunctional roles, such as protecting against herbivores and microbial diseases. Many terpenoids possess antibacterial abilities, functioning as innate antibiotics for the plant. Some studies suggest that exposure to antibiotics may impact the production of terpenoids in plants ( Pichersky and Raguso, 2018; Zacchino et al., 2017 ). If antibiotics successfully manage a bacterial disease, the plant may reduce terpenoid production to preserve resources. The downregulation may serve as a mechanism for the plant to finely adjust its defense strategy. Like terpenoids, phenolic acids have a wide range of functions, one of which is providing defense against infections. They function as antibacterial agents and antioxidants, impeding the growth of microorganisms and preventing plant damage ( Pratyusha, 2022 ). Plants utilize phenolic acids and other signals to establish communication with bacteria in their immediate environment (rhizosphere). Upregulated phenolic acid synthesis, as observed in the Str treatment ( Table 2 ), frequently occurs as a reaction to microbial stimulation, serving as a defensive signal and directly impeding the growth of microorganisms ( Cheynier et al., 2013 ), while their downregulation under Otc conditions ( Table 1 ) could be a resource-saving strategy, as phenolic acid production requires energy and other precursor molecules."

          "This study revealed that the use of streptomycin and oxytetracycline decreased photosynthetic activities in citrus plants while not impacting the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Overall microbial diversity remained constant after antibiotic treatment, but there were alterations in the community composition, particularly in specific beneficial bacterial taxa like Pseudomonas , Agrobacterium , and Streptomyces . Furthermore, between treated and control trees, 547 metabolites showed differential expression. Effects of Str and Otc on citrus plant metabolism also suggest responses to microbial targets or the activation of stress responses.",
          "Future studies should prioritize investigating the exact mechanisms responsible for the varying impacts of Str and Otc on plant physiology and rhizosphere microorganisms. Furthermore, exploring the possibility of reintroducing beneficial bacteria such as Pseudomonas or Streptomyces as probiotics to mitigate the adverse effects of antibiotics could be a promising approach to enhance disease management techniques while protecting the rhizosphere microbiome."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Rhizosphere microbes, living in the narrow zone of soil surrounding plant roots, act as a first line of defense against invading pathogens and play a vital role in plant health by influencing physiological and metabolic processes. The root system releases primary and secondary metabolites, known as root exudates, into the rhizosphere. These exudates serve as carbon/nitrogen substrates, signaling molecules, and chemoattractants for nearby microbes ( Molefe et al., 2023 ). Plants influence the composition of the root microbiome by adjusting the composition of these exudates, which allows them to attract beneficial microbes while repelling harmful ones. Thus, an essential aspect of managing plant diseases is protecting the health of the roots, as the rhizosphere microbes are necessary for plant health ( Ketehouli et al., 2024a, 2024b ). Disrupting this balanced microbial community (eubiosis) through agricultural management practices can interfere with plant health. Antimicrobials are used in agriculture to treat microbial diseases of plants. However, treatment may affect the beneficial role of a healthy microbiome. Thus, to assess the impact of antimicrobials on plant health, studies are needed that evaluate their effects on the pathogen to be treated, the whole plant microbial community, and the plant itself. Many antibiotics that are currently used in the United States of America for crop production target bacterial diseases of tree fruit crops, specifically apples, pears, stone fruit, and citrus ( Archer and Albrecht, 2023; Batuman et al., 2024 ). The administration of antibiotics to manage plant diseases began in the 1950s ( McManus and Stockwell, 2000 ). However, in recent years, the pervasive use of antibiotics in agriculture has raised concerns about their unintended consequences, such as causing an imbalance in the plant microbial community (also known as dysbiosis). Streptomycin and oxytetracycline, two broad-spectrum antibiotics frequently used to manage tomato, citrus, and other crop diseases, are known for their efficacy in reducing disease severity ( Blaustein et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2023 ). Our study examines the effects of these two antibiotics used to treat Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as citrus greening disease, on citrus plants. This disease, caused by the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus ( C Las), poses a significant risk to the long-term viability of the citrus sector ( Graham et al., 2020; McCollum and Baldwin, 2016 ). The direct administration of antibiotics into the trunks of citrus trees infected with C Las resulted in a notable decrease in HLB symptoms ( Hu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2014 ). While antibiotics may be crucial in controlling plant diseases, their indiscriminate use may inadvertently impact non-target beneficial bacterial communities. This potentially disrupts microbial diversity, metabolic processes, and long-term plant health. Metabolomics is a developing technique capable of analyzing alterations in metabolism when an organism reacts to an external stimulus, such as a pathogen invasion, chemical use, and environmental stresses. Metabolomics has been employed on citrus to measure the effects of C Las infection on juice of citrus fruits ( Chin et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2023 ) and the impact of feeding by the C Las vector, the Asian citrus psyllid, on citrus leaves ( Chin et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, metabolomics has been utilized to identify a unique set of metabolites in C Las-infected citrus leaves ( Chen et al., 2022 ) and root tissues ( Chen et al., 2022; Padhi et al., 2019 ). Microbiome research on citrus has found that HLB (Huanglongbing) causes alterations in the composition of bacterial communities. Specifically, there is a change in the composition of the overall soil community, with decreases in the populations of Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Rhodanobacter, Sphingobium, and Sphingomonas ( Chen et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2021 ). Chen et al. (2017) have documented comparable findings, noting a reduction in Burkholderia and Bradyrhizobium in sweet orange trees affected by HLB compared to healthy ones. On the other hand, the families Comamonadaceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, and Rhizobiales seem to be more abundant on the roots of infected trees ( Blaustein et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge regarding the metabolic reaction of citrus roots to antibiotic application and its effect on nearby microbial populations. Indeed, plants under abiotic or biotic stress release a variety of metabolites through their roots, which influence the composition and activity of the rhizosphere microbiome. In turn, the rhizosphere microbiome plays a crucial role in nutrient acquisition, plant growth promotion, and defense against pathogens ( de Andrade et al., 2023; Mendes et al., 2013 ). Hence, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of streptomycin and oxytetracycline on Citrus reticulata (US-942) physiology, its root-associated (rhizosphere) bacterial populations, and metabolite profiles. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Soil sample collection and experimental set up A greenhouse experiment was set up at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, Florida, USA (54 m altitude, 29°63'90''N29°63'90''N and 82°35'60''W82°35'60''W) at 28°C and relative humidity 60–70 %. We grew 6-month-old citrus seedlings (US-942) purchased from Agromillora, Florida, into 1 L pots filled with HFC/B growing mix (purchased from HydraFiber Advanced Substrate, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) until they reached 12 months. Plants were then transplanted to soil collected from a citrus grove soil at the UF IFAS Plant Science Research and Education Unit, Citra, FL; 29.4089563 N −82.1708277 W, in which they were grown for two months. The organic matter content, macro- and micronutrients (soil physicochemical analysis) of the soil was: Cu 2+ (4.2 mg kg −1 ), Mn 2+ (16.76 mg kg −1 ), Ca 2+ (1093.62 mg kg −1 ), Zn 2+ (29.07 mg kg −1 ), Mg 2+ (89.85 mg kg −1 ), K + (81.23 mg kg −1 ), P 3- (239.54 mg kg −1 ), NH 4+ (1.77 mg kg −1 ), NO 3- (37.61 mg kg −1 ), 2.08 % of organic matter, and a pH equal to 6.85. All the pots were watered every three days before and during the treatments. The experimental pots were labeled into three groups: control group (antibiotics-free - Ctrl), oxytetracycline-treated group (Otc), and streptomycin-treated group (Str), with 20 replicates in each group. Two hundred mL of oxytetracycline or streptomycin solutions (600 mg L −1 ) were applied to the plants of the antibiotic treatment groups through the soil-drenching method. The same volume of distilled water used to prepare the antibiotic solutions was applied to the control group. We used two sampling time points after a single antibiotic application (T1) to collect data on the effect of the antibiotic on plant health, as shown in Fig. 1 . The idea behind the two-time points was determining when each antibiotic (streptomycin and oxytetracycline) concentration is reduced by 80 % (T2). 2.2 Antibiotic concentration evaluation in citrus rhizosphere For streptomycin content determination, 2 g homogeneous ground (using a mortar and pestle) root with surrounding soil was put into a centrifuge tube, as recommended by the Streptomycin ELISA Kit manufacturer (Plexense, Inc., Davis, CA, USA). We added 8 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, oscillated for 5 min, and incubated for 30 min in a water bath at 56°C. We centrifuged the solution at 2900 x g at room temperature for 10 min. Then, 1 mL supernatant was transferred into another centrifuge tube, and 1 mL of N-hexane was added and thoroughly mixed, followed by centrifugation at 2900 x g at room temperature for 5 min. We wiped out the upper N-hexane, pipetted 50 μL of the lower water phase, added 450 μL redissolving solution, and mixed for 30 s. Fifty microliters were used for the streptomycin quantification assay using the corresponding detection kit (ab285226 – Streptomycin ELISA Kit, Plexense, Inc. (Davis, CA, USA)). For oxytetracycline detection, 1 g of ground root sample was taken as recommended by the oxytetracycline ELISA Kit manufacturer. We added 5 mL of 1× Sample Dilution solution and then vortexed for 5 min using a multi-vortexer. The obtained solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 2900 x g. Afterward, we transferred 100 μL of clear supernatant to a new tube containing 900 μL of 1× Sample Dilution solution. Finally, we vortexed samples for 1 min and used 100 μL of the sample for the oxytetracycline detection assay following the recommendation of the corresponding detection kit (DEIA-XYZ35 Oxytetracycline ELISA Kit, Creative Diagnostics, Shirley, NY 11967, USA). 2.3 Plant physiology analysis Using the LI-COR portable photosynthesis system (LI-6800, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA), five plants/treatments were chosen randomly to measure photosynthesis and gas exchange and stomatal and transpiration parameters after the application (T1). We took three readings (technical replicates) on hardened (darker green, glossy, and firm to the touch, indicating they are fully developed and capable of photosynthesis at optimal efficiency) leaves per plant. This technique's goal is to allow rapid (12 min) determination of the A/ci response (net CO 2 assimilation (A)) response to intercellular CO 2 concentration (ci), which previously required ∼40 min (standard A/ci approach) ( Taylor and Long, 2019 ). We took measurements for the streptomycin group and control group after 24 h (T2=time where the concentration of streptomycin decreased by 80 %) and for oxytetracycline and control groups after seven days (T2=time at which oxytetracycline concentration in plant root was reduced by 80 %). Parameter setup was as follows: humidifier (20 %); CO 2 concentration (20 %); CO 2 reference level at 420 mmol; H 2 O reference level at 65 %; relative humidity at 50 %; light intensity at 1000 mmol with a red/blue ratio of 9:1; temperature maintained at 28°C as the greenhouse ambient temperature. 2.4 Effects of antibiotics on microbial growth At T1 (24 h) and T2 (7 days), rhizosphere soil samples from five plants per treatment were collected for antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) isolation. This assay aimed to detect and quantify the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in the rhizosphere. The samples were held at 4°C, and the experiment was completed within one week. ARB were isolated using LB (no antibiotics) and LB-containing oxytetracycline (50 µg mL −1 ) or streptomycin (50 µg mL −1 ) solid media based on ( Shah et al., 2014 ). Specifically, rhizosphere soils were mixed with sterile PBS (0.01 M) at a mass ratio 1:1. Two hundred microliters of decimal dilution were spread onto agar plates supplemented with or without antibiotics. Three replicates per suspension were platted. The bacterial colonies on the agar plates were counted after incubation at 37°C for 48 h. The base-10 logarithms (Log 10 ) of the number of colony-forming units (CFU) per 1 g of sample was calculated for all plates. 2.5 Rhizosphere collection and DNA extraction for microbial community identification At each time point, the rhizosphere soil was sampled from ten different plants per treatment to capture the full diversity and reduce variability between samples. Immediately prior to sampling, we prepared epiphyte removal buffer (30 mL per sample) by adding 6.75 g of KH 2 PO 4 , 8.75 g of K 2 HPO 4 , and 1 mL of Triton X-100–1 L of sterile water. The buffer was sterilized using a vacuum filter with 0.22 μm pore size. To collect roots and rhizosphere, we used sterile scissors to cut a representative subsection of roots and place a minimum of 500 mg of root tissue into a 50 mL conical tube. 30 mL of epiphyte removal buffer was added to cover the roots, and the sample was immediately put on dry ice, as indicated by ( Simmons et al., 2018 ). We minimized the breaking of roots that could lead to endophytic bacteria being washed out into the rhizosphere. The samples were then kept at −80°C. To separate the rhizosphere from the roots, we thawed the root sample on ice, then vortexed and sonicated the root samples at 4°C for 10 min. The roots were discarded using sterile forceps. We centrifuged the tube containing buffer and rhizosphere for 10 min at 4°C and 12,300 x g. The supernatant was decanted, followed by a flash freeze of the tube containing the rhizosphere fraction in liquid N 2 , and stored the rhizosphere fraction at −80°C until ready to proceed with DNA extraction. For each sample, 250 mg of rhizosphere soils were used for DNA extraction using a Quick-DNA Fecal/Soil Microbe Miniprep Kit from Zymo Research (Irvine, CA, USA). After eluting the DNA in the elution buffer supplied by the DNA isolation kit, we stored the DNA at −20°C until ready to proceed with submission to SEQCENTER (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for amplification and sequencing the V3−V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene amplification using primer sequences, forward: CCTACGGGDGGCWGCAG; and reverse: GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC ( Klindworth et al., 2013 ). Following clean-up and normalization, samples were sequenced on a P1 600cyc NextSeq2000 Flow cell to generate 2 ×300 bp paired-end (PE) reads. Quality control and adapter trimming were performed with bcl-convert1. Sequences were imported into Qiime22 for subsequent analysis. The cutadapt3 plugin in Qiime2 was used to eliminate the primer sequences. The dada2 plugin in Qiime2 was used to denoise the sequences. Using the VSEARCH5 program within Qiime2's feature-classifier plugin and the Silva 138 99 % OTUs (operational taxonomic units) full-length sequence database, denoised sequences were assigned to OTUs ( Callahan et al., 2016 ). OTUs were then collapsed to their lowest taxonomic units and their counts were converted to reflect their relative frequency within a sample. Raw read data are available in NCBI SRA under the accession number PRJNA1026996. 2.6 Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) for metabolite analysis To investigate the changes in metabolites in the citrus rhizosphere after antibiotic application, rhizosphere soils were collected 24 h and 7 days after streptomycin and oxytetracycline application, respectively. For every 2 g of rhizosphere soil, we added 10 mL of deionized water and mixed by shaking for 3 h at room temperature. We centrifuged for 5 min at 12,300 x g. The supernatant was collected in a new tube and directly stored at −80°C until use. The frozen samples were removed from the −80℃ and processed following Zheng et al. (2020) . The frozen samples were thawed and vortexed for 30 s to mix. We then centrifuged at 1110 x g for 3 min, 6 mL of the supernatant was placed in the corresponding numbered 50 mL centrifuge tube, frozen at −80℃ overnight, and vacuum freeze-dried. After freeze-drying, we added 500 μL of 70 % methanol internal standard extract. We vortexed for 15 min and sonicated in an ice water bath (KQ5200E) for 10 min. We then centrifuged at 4℃ for 3 min at 12,300 x g. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size membrane and stored in the injection vial for LC-MS/MS detection. Metabolites were identified and quantified using the database from Metware Biotechnology Inc., Ltd. in Woburn, Massachusetts. Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) was calculated using Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify metabolite variation among samples. Differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were identified based on the criteria VIP > 1.0, fold-change > 1.5 or < 0.67, and p-value < 0.05. 2.7 Statistical analyses SHAMAN, an online bioinformatic tool for treating raw reads for targeted metagenomics ( https://shaman.pasteur.fr/ ), was used to statistically analyze bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. We obtained bar plots of the microbial community, and Shannon curves to describe the richness of the rhizosphere. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Shannon Index values ( Figure S4 ) were calculated using the Bray–Curtis distance metric, followed by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05) ( Volant et al., 2020 ). Before performing t-tests of relative abundance among treatments of the most represented genera over time (p<0.005 and p<0.001) using Sigma Plot software version 15, the assumption of normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For statistical analyses of metabolites, we normalized relative quantification using unit variance scaling and plotted the results on a heatmap using ComplexHeatmap in R-2023.12.1–402 software to visualize the fold-change of differential metabolites ( Chong and Xia, 2018 ). Pearson correlation was used to perform correlation analysis on differential metabolites. Z-score standardization normalizes the relative content of the differential metabolites by calculating Z-scores. The Z-score is calculated by z = (x - µ) / σ; Where x is a specific score, µ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. For physiological parameters, regression equations f = a*(1 + x) b were subjected to a parallelism (F-test) test of the null hypothesis that the slopes of the equations were equal. The goodness of fit of the models was tested at 0.05 significance and evaluated by its coefficient of determination (R²). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and pairwise Tukey's test were used to determine the significance (P < 0.05) of any differences for base-10 logarithms (Log 10 ) CFU of ARB growth. 3 Results 3.1 Determination of the time when antibiotic concentrations are reduced to 80 % (T2) To standardize our measurements of the effects of antibiotics on microbial communities, antibiotic residual contents in the rhizosphere were assessed to determine the time points where each antibiotic in the roots was reduced to 80 % of the applied concentration. Str showed a reduction of about 80 % after one day. In contrast, Otc by 80 % in about one week ( Fig. 1 ). 3.2 Influence of antibiotics on citrus plant photosynthesis Photosynthesis (assimilation) and transpiration from streptomycin-treated plants decreased by 2.17-fold and 0.35-fold, respectively, after one day compared to the control plants. Similar results were observed from oxytetracycline-received plants in which the assimilation rate decreased by 2.36-fold and the transpiration reduced by 0.33-fold in one day ( Fig. 2 A and B) compared to the control plants. After one week, assimilation and transpiration rates in antibiotics-treated plants were still less than controls (by 1.82-fold in Str treatments and 0.77-fold in Otc treatments for assimilation and by 0.38-fold in Str treatments and 0.19-fold Otc treatments for transpiration) ( Fig. 2 A and B). At the same time, the intracellular carbon dioxide and stomatal conductance to water vapor in both control and antibiotic-treated plants were not significantly different ( Fig. 2 C and D). 3.3 Effect of streptomycin and oxytetracycline on bacterial communities in rhizosphere soil Counts of culturable antibiotic-resistant bacteria in rhizosphere soil examined the antibiotic influence on plant rhizosphere microbiota. Our findings showed that the number of CFU in the rhizosphere decreased after the Str and Otc treatments ( Fig. 3 A), indicating a decrease in the population of susceptible bacteria. For LB-Str and LB-Otc media, CFU counts from the Otc samples were lower when compared with the control samples ( Fig. 3 B and C, respectively). Antibiotic-resistant bacteria showed no significant differences or reduction in the Otc treatment. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed that bacterial community structures differed among treatments. PERMANOVA indicated statistically significant differences in community composition at the genus level one hour after treatment ( Figure S3 A). Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the three most abundant phyla in the rhizosphere with and without antibiotics ( Fig. 4 A). We observed a decrease in abundance of the Pseudomonas genus by 37 % at 24 h for Str application and 50 % at one week for Otc application compared to the controls ( Fig. 4 C and D). Streptomyces abundance increased by 69 % and 37 % under Str and Otc conditions at one day and one week, respectively ( Fig. 4 B). Similar results were observed in the Agrobacterium genus (49.7 % and 45.4 % increase at 24 h and one week of Str and Otc applications, respectively). Rhizobium abundances were highly variable but not statistically different after antibiotic application ( Fig. 4 B-D). The Shannon diversity index showed a similar number of genera in the rhizosphere microbial community at each time point ( Figure S3B ). 3.4 Effect of streptomycin and oxytetracycline on metabolic profiles To assess impacts of Str and Otc applications on the citrus rhizosphere, we examined rhizosphere metabolites using Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). We found a total of 671 metabolites among all samples ( Table S1 ), with abundant classes including flavonoids (15.07 %), phenolic acids (12.31 %), alkaloids (11.69 %), and terpenoids (5.6 %) ( Fig. 5 A and S1). There were similar metabolite compositions among replicates within treatments but differences between the two-time points sampled ( Fig. 5 A, B). We observed the flavonoid class in the top twenty most up and downregulated metabolites 24 h after Str application ( Table 1 , Fig. 5 D), with no flavonoid compounds among the top twenty up or downregulated metabolites one week after Otc application. In contrast, terpenoid compounds were not among the most responsive to Str but were highly downregulated in Otc-treated rhizospheres ( Table 2 , Fig. 5 C). 4 Discussion The extent to which an antibiotic is absorbed or adsorbed is influenced by the charge, hydrophobicity, and polarity of the antibiotic molecule, as well as the properties of the surrounding environment, such as pH, the organic carbon content of particulate matter (e.g., suspended solids, soil particles, sediment particles), and the charge on the surface of the particulate matter ( Kim et al., 2011; ter Laak et al., 2005 ). Our results showed that antibiotic degradation over time in citrus rhizosphere varies based on the antibiotic. Str reached an 80 % reduction after one day of application, while Otc took a week to be 80 % degraded ( Fig. 1 ). The primary mechanisms for the decomposition of antibiotics are hydrolysis and photolysis. It has been observed that several antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline ( Loftin et al., 2008; Pouliquen et al., 2007 ); penicillin G (D. Li et al., 2008 ), and sulfadiazine ( Yang et al., 2009 ) undergo hydrolysis in the environment. The pH of the environment typically influences hydrolysis processes, as they depend on the ratio of H 3 O + to OH - . Microorganisms may break down xenobiotic compounds such as antibiotics, which are foreign to known enzyme systems, by developing novel metabolic pathways over time ( Top and Springael, 2003 ). We showed that Str and Otc affect the microbial community differently ( Fig. 4 ), which may also affect the degradation of the two antibiotics. While oxytetracycline and streptomycin application could potentially combat C Las, they may also have detrimental effects on plant physiology and growth, because antibiotic application affects beneficial rhizobacteria, which are known to improve plant health, development, and physiology ( Ketehouli et al., 2024a, 2024b; Martins et al., 2018 ). Daniels (1982) demonstrated that oxytetracycline application via stem injection (0.1 mL at 1–10 mg mL −1 ) in kidney beans' roots and leaves changes the microflora in the rhizoplane. According to our results, the photosynthesis (assimilation) and transpiration of antibiotic-treated plants significantly decreased compared to control plants ( Fig. 2 A-B). Transpiration and photosynthesis are vital for all plants, but they also generate poisonous reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Kapoor et al., 2019 ). Plant metabolic activities may be disturbed when subjected to chemical stress, such as antibiotic exposure ( Khan et al., 2021 ). Plants downregulate photosynthesis, an energy-intensive activity, to save resources and energy. Photosynthesis and transpiration are closely related processes involving water vapor loss through leaves ( Zhu et al., 2010 ). Plants decrease transpiration to conserve water when photosynthesis slows down because of chemical or other stress. This is particularly crucial in scenarios where there is a water shortage or when chemical stress has damaged the plant's capacity to absorb water ( Zhu et al., 2010 ). The decrease in transpiration and photosynthesis is a reaction by plants to deal with stress brought on by antibiotics and preserve vital physiological processes and survival. Understanding the physiological responses of citrus plants to antibiotic exposure is essential to building a foundation for biotechnological methods to enhance the removal of antibiotics from the rhizosphere (phytoremediation) and identify the harmful effects of antibiotics in the environment. Our study examined the effect of two antibiotics on the culturable bacteria over time. Significant differences were noted in CFU counts on LB-antibiotic-free media. Interestingly, oxytetracycline in the rhizosphere or supplemented on LB medium significantly affected the CFU counts after a week ( Fig. 3 A and C). Streptomycin affected the culturable bacterial growth in nature, not when used as a supplement in LB medium ( Fig. 3 A and B). These results suggest that oxytetracycline inhibits bacteria more than streptomycin. Colinas et al. (1994) examined the impact of antibiotics and combinations of antibiotics (oxytetracycline and penicillin) on the number of CFUs in soil and showed that the exposure to the two compounds led to a 20 % decrease in active CFU counts and a 29 % decrease in overall CFU counts relative to the control value. These results demonstrate the capacity of specific antimicrobial agents to inhibit active CFU counts. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed distinct differences in bacterial community structures after antibiotic application ( Fig. 4 ). We detected a variation in the abundance of bacteria in the genera Pseudomonas , Streptomyces , and Agrobacterium . The reduction in the Pseudomonas population (37 % following Str treatment and 50 % following Otc application) indicates that both antibiotics have an adverse effect on this genus. The observed increase in Streptomyces abundance (69 % under Str and 37 % under Otc) suggests that these bacteria may possess more resistance to the antibiotics or derive advantages from decreased competition with Pseudomonas and other sensitive taxa. This enhancement may be related to their involvement in antibiotic production, since some Streptomyces species synthesize antibiotics and may exhibit greater tolerance towards their existence ( Klindworth et al., 2013; Muteeb et al., 2023 ). Other studies have found that oxytetracycline application inhibited plant growth by reducing nutrient uptake, reduced the overall bacterial count in the rhizoplane, and elevated both fungal populations and the number of oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria in the rhizoplane ( Daniels, 1982 ). Ascunce et al. (2019) demonstrated that administering penicillin through trunk injections can impact the bacterial population composition in citrus roots and rhizosphere. Further investigation is needed to study the role of Pseudomonas spp., Streptomyces spp., or Agrobacterium spp. in the rhizosphere and assess their potential in mitigating the adverse effects of antibiotics on citrus trees, particularly as a synthetic microbial community ( Martins et al., 2023 ). Metabolomics analyses revealed that the top twenty metabolites that were decreased and increased in citrus plants treated with streptomycin and oxytetracycline were distinct, but more similar to their corresponding control plants at the two timepoints. Thus, the stress responses examined are relative to plant condition. The upregulation and downregulation of flavonoids ( Table 2 ) indicate that citrus roots released flavonoids in response to Str. The flavonoid pathway generates a wide range of plant chemicals that serve many purposes, such as providing UV protection, acting as antioxidants, serving as pigments, regulating auxin transport, acting as defense molecules against pathogens, and participating in signaling during symbiosis ( Hassan and Mathesius, 2012 ). In addition, flavonoids modify the soil by functioning as antioxidants and metal chelators. Chelation and reduction of metals can alter the nutrient levels in the soil, which can be particularly significant for the accessibility of phosphorus and iron. One instance is the discovery of an isoflavonoid in the root exudates of Medicago sativa (alfalfa) that can dissolve ferric phosphate. This makes phosphate and iron accessible to the plant ( Hassan and Mathesius, 2012; Masaoka et al., 1993 ). Flavonoids can be synthesized and explicitly released in response to abiotic and biotic signals in the rhizosphere ( Dixon and Paiva, 1995 ). Terpenoid compounds were downregulated in the rhizosphere of Otc-treated plants. Terpenoids are another vast and varied collection of plant secondary metabolites renowned for their multifunctional roles, such as protecting against herbivores and microbial diseases. Many terpenoids possess antibacterial abilities, functioning as innate antibiotics for the plant. Some studies suggest that exposure to antibiotics may impact the production of terpenoids in plants ( Pichersky and Raguso, 2018; Zacchino et al., 2017 ). If antibiotics successfully manage a bacterial disease, the plant may reduce terpenoid production to preserve resources. The downregulation may serve as a mechanism for the plant to finely adjust its defense strategy. Like terpenoids, phenolic acids have a wide range of functions, one of which is providing defense against infections. They function as antibacterial agents and antioxidants, impeding the growth of microorganisms and preventing plant damage ( Pratyusha, 2022 ). Plants utilize phenolic acids and other signals to establish communication with bacteria in their immediate environment (rhizosphere). Upregulated phenolic acid synthesis, as observed in the Str treatment ( Table 2 ), frequently occurs as a reaction to microbial stimulation, serving as a defensive signal and directly impeding the growth of microorganisms ( Cheynier et al., 2013 ), while their downregulation under Otc conditions ( Table 1 ) could be a resource-saving strategy, as phenolic acid production requires energy and other precursor molecules. 5 Conclusion This study revealed that the use of streptomycin and oxytetracycline decreased photosynthetic activities in citrus plants while not impacting the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Overall microbial diversity remained constant after antibiotic treatment, but there were alterations in the community composition, particularly in specific beneficial bacterial taxa like Pseudomonas , Agrobacterium , and Streptomyces . Furthermore, between treated and control trees, 547 metabolites showed differential expression. Effects of Str and Otc on citrus plant metabolism also suggest responses to microbial targets or the activation of stress responses. Future studies should prioritize investigating the exact mechanisms responsible for the varying impacts of Str and Otc on plant physiology and rhizosphere microorganisms. Furthermore, exploring the possibility of reintroducing beneficial bacteria such as Pseudomonas or Streptomyces as probiotics to mitigate the adverse effects of antibiotics could be a promising approach to enhance disease management techniques while protecting the rhizosphere microbiome.
