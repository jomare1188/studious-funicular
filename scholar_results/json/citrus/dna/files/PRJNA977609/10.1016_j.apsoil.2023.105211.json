    "full_text": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous soil fungi in orchard ecosystem, conferring a diverse array of benefits to citrus plants. However, how natural grass coverage, a common phenomenon in citrus orchards in southern China, shifts AM fungal communities in subtropical citrus orchards is far from being understood, especially on a regional scale, which impedes the understanding of the indigenous AM fungal adaptations. In this study, natural grass coverage rate, soil chemical properties, and soil AM fungal community in 80 sampling sites spanning 179, 700 km 2 area in subtropical citrus orchards were investigated. The result of 18S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing revealed that a total of eight AM fungal genera were identified and Glomus (90.15 %) was dominant genus in the community in citrus orchards. Natural grass coverage significantly increased soil organic matter (SOM), soil available phosphorus, and AM fungal alpha diversity, especially Glomus . Variation partitioning analysis revealed that grass coverage rate explained more variation in AM fungal alpha diversity than SOM. All the contrasting AM fungal species between different grass coverage rates and all the core AM fungal species belonged to Glomus . Null model analysis revealed that determinism played a slightly larger role in the assembly process of AM fungal communities than stochasticity with a distance-decay relationship. Moreover, natural grass coverage increased the relative importance of stochasticity in the community assembly. Taken together, these results suggest that maintaining natural grass coverage (naturally growing grass) is an effective nature-based solution for enriching AM fungal communities, which is essential for the sustainability of citrus production."

          "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous soil fungi establishing symbioses with the roots of the majority of terrestrial plants, especially horticultural plants. AM fungi play fundamental roles in promoting nutrient uptake (e.g., P, N, Zn, and Se), enhancing biotic and abiotic stress resistance (e.g., pathogens, low pH, drought, and high temperature) for host plants, maintaining ecosystem stability and diversity ( Feng et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2022 ; Genre et al., 2020 ). In view of their great promotion of plant growth and product quality, AM fungi have been regarded as ‘biofertilizers’ and ‘biopesticides’ in horticultural production ( Baum et al., 2015 ; Berruti et al., 2016 ; Anand et al., 2022 ). Until now, a large number of studies have revealed the promoting effects of AM fungi on a wide variety of horticultural plants under adverse cultivation conditions. For instance, inoculation with indigenous AM fungi reduced the Phytophthora root rot symptom in citrus plants ( Watanarojanaporn et al., 2011 ). In addition, AM fungi are able to enhance antioxidant defense systems and scavenge reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing oxidative damage induced by drought and promoting plant growth of trifoliate orange ( Zou et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2022 ; Yin et al., 2023 ). Several of our previous studies demonstrated that inoculation with AM fungi significantly promoted tomato growth and phosphorus (P) uptake, particularly under low pH stress ( Wang et al., 2017 ; Feng et al., 2020a ; Liu et al., 2020a ). The above experimental evidence consistently highlights the enormous potential of AM fungi for applications in horticultural production, especially in sustainable agricultural ecosystems.",
          "Considering the restriction of pure culture technology of AM fungi, taking full advantage of indigenous AM fungi in soils is an alternative and high-efficiency strategy, which has been verified in numerous horticultural plants ( Watanarojanaporn et al., 2011 ; Surendirakumar et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2019 ). In fact, previous studies revealed that indigenous AM fungal community are frequently driven by multiple biotic and abiotic factors, including host plant species ( Bittebiere et al., 2020 ; Senés-Guerrero et al., 2020 ), soil chemical properties ( Yoshimura et al., 2012 ; Van Geel et al., 2017 ; Feng et al., 2023a ), climate ( Deveautour et al., 2020 ), elevation ( Liu et al., 2023 ), and agricultural practices ( Gu et al., 2020 ; Pellegrino et al., 2020 ; Chen et al., 2022 ). With SSU rDNA sequencing, Yoshimura et al. (2012) detected 14 phylotypes of AM fungi in pear orchards, and then indicated that both mycorrhizal colonization and species richness had negative correlations with available phosphorus (AP) content in soils. With the similar molecular technique, Pellegrino et al. (2020) demonstrated that weed control by frequent surface tillage in orchards reduced root colonization and diversity of AM fungal community. Recently, Feng et al. (2023a) revealed that compared with the original soil pH, increased and decreased soil pH by adding calcium hydroxide and sulfur significantly reduced AM fungal richness and diversity.",
          "These studies demonstrated the great pressure on indigenous AM fungal community composition exerted by external factors (e.g., soil chemical properties and agricultural practices) and the potential risk of reducing AM fungal community, such as richness and diversity. Therefore, enriching AM fungal communities in native soils is a crucial prerequisite for the full utilization of indigenous AM fungi in agricultural production. Some agricultural practices, including planting grass and crop rotation, can increase AM fungal colonization and propagules (e.g., spores, vesicles, and hyphae), as well as glomalin-related soil protein contents in soils ( Wang et al., 2016 ; Chagnon et al., 2022 ). In contrast, other agricultural practices, such as the utilization of nature-based solutions (using natural conditions to solve agricultural problems), have higher promotional value and feasibility when considering the input costs and convenience in agricultural production.",
          "Citrus is one of the most widely cultivated horticultural crops and fruits in the world, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions ( Panwar et al., 2021 ). In China, the cultivation of citrus fruits is mainly in southern China, such as Guangdong Province. A series of adverse cultivation conditions, however, frequently occur in citrus production of southern China, including acidic soils (low pH stress), aluminum toxicity, low available nutrient (e.g., AP) content, seasonal drought, and high temperature ( Wang et al., 2014 ; Cui et al., 2015 ; Liu et al., 2020a ; Tu et al., 2021 ). Additionally, the water and nutrient uptake of citrus plants is extremely dependent on AM fungi because of their shorter and scarce root hairs ( Song et al., 2015 ; Chen et al., 2017 ; Wu et al., 2017 ). Correspondingly, the application of AM fungal biotechnology to citrus production is highly recommended, especially in southern China.",
          "Natural grass coverage is a common phenomenon in citrus orchards in southern China, with grass coverage rates varying widely among different citrus orchards, even within the same citrus orchard. Although the benefits of artificial grass coverage, such as sod culture, on water and soil conservation, soil nutrient, and microbial diversity have been widely recognized ( Zhou et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2021 ; Xiang et al., 2023 ), whether natural grass coverage is an effective nature-based solution to enrich AM fungal communities in citrus orchards is largely unknown. In addition, little is known about how natural grass coverage affects the AM fungal community composition and the mechanisms underlying community assembly in citrus orchards, particularly on a regional scale.",
          "In this study, we collected soil samples in subtropical citrus orchards spanning 179,700 km 2 area in southern China and then sequenced soil AM fungal communities at two grass coverage rates (i.e., low grass coverage rate and high grass coverage rate). The purposes of this study were to address: 1) how do two grass coverage rates affect AM fungal richness, diversity, and composition on a regional scale? 2) How do soil chemical properties affect AM fungal taxa and which AM fungi are the core species in subtropical citrus orchards? 3) How do the ecological processes shaping AM fungal communities differ between two grass coverage rates? This study has the potential to provide new insights into AM fungal resources and biogeographical patterns in subtropical citrus orchards on a regional scale, and to validate a nature-based solution for enriching AM fungal communities in citrus production."

A total of 80 sampling sites spanning 179,700 km 2 area were investigated based on the cultivation area of citrus in each administrative region in Guangdong Province published in Guangdong Statistical Yearbook in 2018 ( Fig. 1 ). After removing visible plant litter and gravels, three soil cores of 5 cm diameter and 20 cm depth were collected using a stainless-steel soil auger under the canopy drip line of a citrus tree, and then a total of nine cores from three different citrus trees were pooled and homogenized thoroughly by a sieve with 2-mm pore size as one soil sample (i.e., one sampling site). Subsequently, a soil sample was divided into two sub-samples. A sub-sample was air-dried at room temperature for analysis of soil chemical properties. Another sub-sample was stored at −20 °C for soil DNA extraction.",

To visualize the cultivation area of citrus in each administrative region in Guangdong Province, we drew a map to show the difference of the cultivation area by the gradation of green color with the ‘maptools’ package ( Bivand and Lewin-Koh, 2013 ).",
              "To avoid bias in the downstream analyses of AM fungal community, all soil samples were normalized to 28,169 sequences (i.e., the lowest number of sequences, 28,169–35,968 per sample) by random subsampling with the ‘rrarefy’ function of the ‘vegan’ package ( Sosa-Hernández et al., 2018 ). AM fungal richness indexes (i.e., observed OTUs, Chao1 index, and ACE index) and diversity indexes (i.e., Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index) were calculated with the ‘vegan’ package. The differences in the relative abundance of certain AM fungal taxa between LGCR and HGCR may not truly reflect the differences in their absolute abundance because of the lack of total AM fungal abundance ( Morton et al., 2019 ; Ma et al., 2020 ). Differential ranking analysis was performed to evaluate the log-fold change of AM fungal genera and OTUs that were truly different at two grass coverage rates using multinomial regression as implemented in Songbird ( Morton et al., 2019 ). A heatmap based on Spearman correlation analysis was generated with the ‘corr.test’ function of the ‘psych’ and ‘corrplot’ packages to show the correlation among soil chemical properties, the alpha diversity indices, and AM fungal genera ( Revelle, 2020 ).",
              "Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) was performed using the ‘varpart’ and ‘anova.cca’ functions of the ‘vegan’ package to quantify the contributions of grass coverage rate and soil organic matter to the AM fungal richness and diversity represented by observed OTUs and Shannon-Wiener index, respectively. To identify whether the differences of AM fungal community structure between LGCR and HGCR is significant, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were performed with the ‘anosim’ and ‘adonis’ functions of the ‘vegan’ package, respectively. Furthermore, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed with the ‘pcoa’ function of the ‘ape’ and ‘ggplot2’ packages to visualize two AM fungal community structures ( Paradis et al., 2004 ; Wickham, 2011 ). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed with the ‘decorana’, ‘cca’, and ‘envfit’ functions of the ‘vegan’ package to estimate the effects of soil chemical properties on AM fungal community. A Manhattan plot based on P -valve from Wilcoxon test was generated to show the contrasting AM fungal species between LGCR and HGCR, where the contrasting AM fungal species were defined as the OTUs significantly enriched or depleted in HGCR.",
              "Core AM fungal species were defined as the OTUs whose relative abundance and occupancy (i.e., the relative frequency of occurrence of certain OTU in all the samples) were >0.1 % and 0.80, respectively ( Shade and Handelsman, 2012 ). The main AM fungal predictors at OTU level (relative abundance ≥ 0.02 %) for the grass coverage rate were identified by random forest analysis with the ‘rfPermute’ package ( Archer, 2013 ). The cross-validated R 2 values and significance were further verified with the ‘A3’ package ( Jiao et al., 2018 ).",
              "In general, the biological similarity of microbial community decreases with geographical distance ( Soininen et al., 2007 ). To verify whether there is distance-decay relationship in AM fungal communities of 80 sampling sites along the sampling distances, we calculated all the distances between any two sampling sites based on the longitude and latitude of the sampling sites with the ‘distm’ function of the ‘geosphere’ package, thus producing 3160 distances [(80 × 79) / 2 = 3160] ( Hijmans et al., 2017 ). Then, a distance-decay relationship was shown by using the distance between any two sampling sites and Bray-Curtis similarity in a general linear model. To determine which ecological processes determine AM fungal community assembly in citrus orchards on a regional scale, we performed a null model analysis ( Liu et al., 2023 ). Beta mean nearest taxon distance (βMNTD) was calculated with the ‘comdistnt’ function of the ‘picante’ package (abundance.weighted = TRUE) ( Kembel et al., 2010 ; Stegen et al., 2012, 2013 ). Beta nearest taxon index (βNTI) was defined as the standard deviations of βMNTD ( Stegen et al., 2012 ). Bray-Curtis-based Raup-Crick (RC Bray ) was calculated with the ‘vegdist’ function of the ‘vegan’ package ( Bray and Curtis, 1957 ; Stegen et al., 2015 ). The ecological process of any two communities was determined based the results of βNTI and RC Bray ( Stegen et al., 2015 ; Zhou and Ning, 2017 ). Briefly, five ecological processes were identified, including homogeneous selection (βNTI < −2), heterogeneous selection (βNTI > 2), homogenizing dispersal (|βNTI| < 2 and RC Bray < −0.95), dispersal limitation (|βNTI| < 2 and RC Bray > 0.95), and undominated (|βNTI| < 2 and |RC Bray | < 0.95), based on βNTI and RC Bray ."

              "To find out the contrasting AM fungal species between LGCR and HGCR, the OTUs, whose relative abundances were >0.02 % and significantly affected by grass coverage rate ( P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), were investigated and further shown by Manhattan plot ( Fig. 6 a ). HGCR significantly enriched 19 OTUs (15.97 %) and depleted 6 OTUs (5.04 %). Importantly, all significantly enriched and depleted OTUs belonged to the genus Glomus ( Fig. 6 a). Moreover, OTU4 ( Glomus _VTX00270) had the highest relative abundance (5.48 %) and was significantly enriched in HGCR; while OTU7 ( Glomus _VTX00126) had the highest relative abundance (4.68 %) and was significantly depleted in HGCR ( Fig. 6 a). Differential ranking analysis was performed at OTU level and the log-fold change between LGCR and HGCR of 313 OTUs was ranked by performing multinomial regression. The log-fold changes of 15 out of 19 OTUs significantly enriched in HGCR were greater than zero, ranging from 0.57 to 3.36; while the log-fold changes of 4 out of 6 OTUs significantly depleted in HGCR were lesser than zero, ranging from −0.38 to −2.25 ( Fig. 6 b). These results indicated that most of the OTUs that differ significantly in relative abundance between LGCR and HGCR also differ in absolute abundance.",
              "To further find out the core AM fungal species in 80 sampling sites, we investigated the OTUs, whose relative abundances were >0.1 % and were detected in at least 80 % sites (occupancy ≥ 0.80). A total of eight OTUs were defined as the core AM fungal species, including OTU4 (occupancy = 0.91, relative abundance = 5.48 %) and OTU7 (occupancy = 0.85, relative abundance = 4.68 %) ( Fig. 7 a and Table S2). Importantly, all of core AM fungal species belonged to the genus Glomus (Table S2).",
              "We further evaluated the biological contributions of the AM fungal OTUs to grass coverage rate via a random forest regression ( Fig. 7 b). The random forest model explained 26.29 % of the variation in grass coverage rate ( R 2 = 0.2629, P < 0.001). Three significant predictors were identified ( P < 0.05), among which OTU4 was the most important (Increase in MSE % = 17.96 %), followed by OTU69 (Increase in MSE % = 14.90 %), and OTU81 (Increase in MSE % = 8.73 %) ( Fig. 7 b). In addition, we also established a random forest classification to define biomarkers to differentiate AM fungal communities at LGCR and HGCR. After tenfold cross-validation, ten OTUs exhibited the lowest error rates which were therefore defined as biomarker taxa, among which OTU4 was the most important biomarker taxon (Fig. S3). Furthermore, 9 out of 10 OTUs significantly enriched in HGCR, and one OTU significantly depleted in HGCR (Fig. S3)."

To further decipher the ecological process of the community assembly on a regional scale, null model analysis was performed.

Specifically, heterogeneous selection (54.46 %) was the most important ecological process in AM fungal community assembly, followed by undominated (38.10 %), dispersal limitation (7.19 %), homogenizing dispersal (0.19 %), and homogeneous selection (0.06 %) ( Fig. 8 c)."

            "paragraphs": [
              "A large number of AM fungal isolates have been identified from a variety of ecosystems, including citrus orchards. According to Wu and Zou (2014) , 45 species belonging to seven genera of indigenous AM fungi have been isolated from citrus orchards. We previously collected 28 AM fungal isolates based on the spore morphological features from one citrus orchard ( Feng et al., 2023a ). These results suggest that citrus orchards harbor abundant AM fungi. In the study, we identified eight genera of AM fungi in soils from 80 sampling sites. Remarkably, Glomus accounted for 90.15 % of the community in terms of OTU abundance, highlighting the dominance of Glomus in citrus orchards. Approximately 346 AM fungal species are currently validly described and Glomus is one of the most inclusive genera, comprising 53 species ( https://amf-phylogeny.jimdofree.com/species-list/ , last updated on Jan. 14, 2023). Meanwhile, Glomus is the most widely distributed genus, occurring in various orchard ecosystems ( Sharma et al., 2009 ; Wang et al., 2011 ; Huang et al., 2019 ; Jiang et al., 2020 ).",
              "Soil P, especially AP, is one of the most critical edaphic factors influencing the colonization and growth of AM fungi ( Xiao et al., 2019 ; Dueñas et al., 2020 ; Qin et al., 2020 ). In recent five decades (1961–2015), the amount of global P fertilizer applied to agricultural ecosystems has increased from 4.6 million tons per annum to approximately 21 million tons per annum and has maintained an increasing trend up to now ( Mogollón et al., 2018 ; Bindraban et al., 2020 ). Overall, we found that the AP content in soils from 80 sampling sites was high and the average content was 181.70 mg kg −1 (142.29 mg kg −1 at LGCR, 221.10 mg kg −1 at HGCR). High AP generally suppresses AM fungal colonization, sporulation, hyphal density, and community diversity in soils ( Yoshimura et al., 2012 ; Sheng et al., 2013 ; Xu et al., 2018 ; Qin et al., 2020 ). In this study, only the relative abundance of Glomus had significantly positive correlations with AP and AP:TP; by contrast, those of other seven genera had no significant correlations or even significantly negative correlations with AP and AP:TP, indicating a stronger tolerance and competitiveness of Glomus in agricultural soils with high AP content ( Fig. 9 ). In addition, all the contrasting AM fungal species between LGCR and HGCR as well as all the core AM fungal species from 80 sampling sites belonged to Glomus . These features may have given Glomus a wide range of ecological adaptations and environmental responses, allowing the genus to occur abundantly in almost all citrus orchards in this study.",
              "Many pot culture experiments demonstrated that the isolates of Glomus often show positive effects and promote plant growth of diverse woody plant species, especially citrus plants ( Frosi et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ; Hadian-Deljou et al., 2020 ). Since Glomus is the dominant AM fungal taxa in citrus orchards in this study, it is possible that these indigenous AM fungi contribute to the tolerance of citrus plants to seasonal drought ( Wu et al., 2013 ), which represents an important obstacle to citrus production in southern China ( Tu et al., 2021 )."

              "Effects of grass coverage on soil chemical properties, enzyme activities, and microbial diversity have been extensively recognized ( Cui et al., 2015 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2021 ; Xiang et al., 2023 ). In this study, HGCR significantly increased SOM, AP, and AP:TP by 20.31 %, 55.39 %, and 32.86 %, respectively. Remarkably, the greatest rate of increase occurred in the AP under the premise that there is no significant shift in TP, indicating a higher active P-turnover from unavailable P to AP at HGCR. Soil microbes involved in this process include not only AM fungi but also phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), which were found to be abundant and diverse in citrus orchards ( Liu et al., 2020b ; Qin et al., 2022 ). Our previous study revealed that the grass coverage by planting Paspalum natatu or Stylosanthes guianensis in a subtropical orchard could increase SOM and the species richness of PSB, enhancing acid, neutral, and alkaline phosphomonoesterase activities ( Cui et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, recent studies showed that AM fungi-PSB interactions in hyphosphere enhanced the mineralization of organic P ( Jiang et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2023 ). In brief, HGCR increased SOM and might enhance microbial interactions involved in P turnover, resulting in increased P availability in soils ( Fig. 9 ).",
              "External factors determining AM fungal community in orchards can be diverse, including AP, soil organic carbon, acidity, cover cropping, and mechanical tillage ( Yoshimura et al., 2012 ; Van Geel et al., 2017 ; Lombardo et al., 2019 ; Pellegrino et al., 2020 ). Grass coverage in orchards has been highly recommended for decades. In this study, HGCR with natural grasses significantly increased AM fungal diversity. Similar effects, such as increasing AM fungal diversity and activity (mycorrhizal inoculum potential), of grass coverage on AM fungi were reported previously ( Wang et al., 2016 ; Turrini et al., 2017 ; Pellegrino et al., 2020 ). Importantly, SOM was the only edaphic factor that had significant positive correlations with all AM fungal alpha diversity indexes. VPA further revealed that both grass coverage rate and SOM significantly explained the variation in AM fungal richness and diversity, with the former accounting for 2–4 times more variation than the latter, although most of the variation was unexplained. The result indicated that there were at least two pathways for grass coverage rate to affect the AM fungal alpha diversity: the first was through affecting SOM, the second was the direct effect of grass coverage rate, and the latter was more primary ( Fig. 9 ). AM fungi are obligate symbiotic fungi, whose proliferation and functionality strongly depend on the carbon sources from host plants in the forms of sugars and lipids ( Roth and Paszkowski, 2017 ; Feng et al., 2020a, 2020b ). In addition, many previous studies showed that AM fungi have host preference in various ecosystems ( Martínez-García and Pugnaire, 2011 ; Bittebiere et al., 2020 ; Senés-Guerrero et al., 2020 ). Therefore, in citrus orchards, higher grass coverage rate could provide more choices and nutrients (e.g., sugars and lipids) for AM fungi in soils to establish and maintain the symbioses. Collectively, these studies suggest that grass coverage in orchards is an appropriate nature-based solution compatible with AM fungal biotechnology."

              "Understanding the ecological process of AM fungal communities is essential for the manipulation and application of indigenous AM fungi. In this study, determinism (54.53 %) was slightly more dominant than stochasticity (45.47 %) based on all the samples in citrus orchards on a regional scale. However, the relative importance of stochasticity increased from 38.59 % to 50.77 % with increasing grass coverage rate, indicating a positive correlation between grass coverage rate and stochasticity. The effects of plant communities including host plants and non-host plants, especially natural plant communities, on AM fungi are complex and difficult to predict because of the interspecific and intraspecific plant interactions ( Kokkoris et al., 2020 ). Based on this, once the species and abundance of grass communities decrease, or even disappear (grass coverage rate = 0 %), the plant factors affecting AM fungal communities in citrus orchards were reduced, resulting in the decreased importance of stochasticity and the increased importance of determinism. A previous work by Lekberg et al. (2007) indicated the role of environment and interspecific competition in AM fungal community assembly on a local scale. However, Shi et al. (2014) found that both stochasticity and determinism were involved in the AM fungal community assembly during the spreading of toxic plants in an alpine meadow, and the relative importance of both processes changed with the spreading of toxic plants. Additionally, the relative importance of stochasticity and determinism depends on the spatial scale of sampling ( Chaudhary et al., 2014 ). It is likely that in this study, natural grass coverage on a regional scale led to an increase in the relative importance of stochasticity in the assembly processes of AM fungal communities."

Natural grass coverage affected AM fungal communities through the regulation of Glomus . Based on the results of the null model analysis, natural grass coverage increased the relative importance of stochasticity in the AM fungal community assembly, with a similar importance between determinism and stochasticity on a regional scale.

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous soil fungi establishing symbioses with the roots of the majority of terrestrial plants, especially horticultural plants. AM fungi play fundamental roles in promoting nutrient uptake (e.g., P, N, Zn, and Se), enhancing biotic and abiotic stress resistance (e.g., pathogens, low pH, drought, and high temperature) for host plants, maintaining ecosystem stability and diversity ( Feng et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2022 ; Genre et al., 2020 ). In view of their great promotion of plant growth and product quality, AM fungi have been regarded as ‘biofertilizers’ and ‘biopesticides’ in horticultural production ( Baum et al., 2015 ; Berruti et al., 2016 ; Anand et al., 2022 ). Until now, a large number of studies have revealed the promoting effects of AM fungi on a wide variety of horticultural plants under adverse cultivation conditions. For instance, inoculation with indigenous AM fungi reduced the Phytophthora root rot symptom in citrus plants ( Watanarojanaporn et al., 2011 ). In addition, AM fungi are able to enhance antioxidant defense systems and scavenge reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing oxidative damage induced by drought and promoting plant growth of trifoliate orange ( Zou et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2022 ; Yin et al., 2023 ). Several of our previous studies demonstrated that inoculation with AM fungi significantly promoted tomato growth and phosphorus (P) uptake, particularly under low pH stress ( Wang et al., 2017 ; Feng et al., 2020a ; Liu et al., 2020a ). The above experimental evidence consistently highlights the enormous potential of AM fungi for applications in horticultural production, especially in sustainable agricultural ecosystems. Considering the restriction of pure culture technology of AM fungi, taking full advantage of indigenous AM fungi in soils is an alternative and high-efficiency strategy, which has been verified in numerous horticultural plants ( Watanarojanaporn et al., 2011 ; Surendirakumar et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2019 ). In fact, previous studies revealed that indigenous AM fungal community are frequently driven by multiple biotic and abiotic factors, including host plant species ( Bittebiere et al., 2020 ; Senés-Guerrero et al., 2020 ), soil chemical properties ( Yoshimura et al., 2012 ; Van Geel et al., 2017 ; Feng et al., 2023a ), climate ( Deveautour et al., 2020 ), elevation ( Liu et al., 2023 ), and agricultural practices ( Gu et al., 2020 ; Pellegrino et al., 2020 ; Chen et al., 2022 ). With SSU rDNA sequencing, Yoshimura et al. (2012) detected 14 phylotypes of AM fungi in pear orchards, and then indicated that both mycorrhizal colonization and species richness had negative correlations with available phosphorus (AP) content in soils. With the similar molecular technique, Pellegrino et al. (2020) demonstrated that weed control by frequent surface tillage in orchards reduced root colonization and diversity of AM fungal community. Recently, Feng et al. (2023a) revealed that compared with the original soil pH, increased and decreased soil pH by adding calcium hydroxide and sulfur significantly reduced AM fungal richness and diversity. These studies demonstrated the great pressure on indigenous AM fungal community composition exerted by external factors (e.g., soil chemical properties and agricultural practices) and the potential risk of reducing AM fungal community, such as richness and diversity. Therefore, enriching AM fungal communities in native soils is a crucial prerequisite for the full utilization of indigenous AM fungi in agricultural production. Some agricultural practices, including planting grass and crop rotation, can increase AM fungal colonization and propagules (e.g., spores, vesicles, and hyphae), as well as glomalin-related soil protein contents in soils ( Wang et al., 2016 ; Chagnon et al., 2022 ). In contrast, other agricultural practices, such as the utilization of nature-based solutions (using natural conditions to solve agricultural problems), have higher promotional value and feasibility when considering the input costs and convenience in agricultural production. Citrus is one of the most widely cultivated horticultural crops and fruits in the world, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions ( Panwar et al., 2021 ). In China, the cultivation of citrus fruits is mainly in southern China, such as Guangdong Province. A series of adverse cultivation conditions, however, frequently occur in citrus production of southern China, including acidic soils (low pH stress), aluminum toxicity, low available nutrient (e.g., AP) content, seasonal drought, and high temperature ( Wang et al., 2014 ; Cui et al., 2015 ; Liu et al., 2020a ; Tu et al., 2021 ). Additionally, the water and nutrient uptake of citrus plants is extremely dependent on AM fungi because of their shorter and scarce root hairs ( Song et al., 2015 ; Chen et al., 2017 ; Wu et al., 2017 ). Correspondingly, the application of AM fungal biotechnology to citrus production is highly recommended, especially in southern China. Natural grass coverage is a common phenomenon in citrus orchards in southern China, with grass coverage rates varying widely among different citrus orchards, even within the same citrus orchard. Although the benefits of artificial grass coverage, such as sod culture, on water and soil conservation, soil nutrient, and microbial diversity have been widely recognized ( Zhou et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2021 ; Xiang et al., 2023 ), whether natural grass coverage is an effective nature-based solution to enrich AM fungal communities in citrus orchards is largely unknown. In addition, little is known about how natural grass coverage affects the AM fungal community composition and the mechanisms underlying community assembly in citrus orchards, particularly on a regional scale. In this study, we collected soil samples in subtropical citrus orchards spanning 179,700 km 2 area in southern China and then sequenced soil AM fungal communities at two grass coverage rates (i.e., low grass coverage rate and high grass coverage rate). The purposes of this study were to address: 1) how do two grass coverage rates affect AM fungal richness, diversity, and composition on a regional scale? 2) How do soil chemical properties affect AM fungal taxa and which AM fungi are the core species in subtropical citrus orchards? 3) How do the ecological processes shaping AM fungal communities differ between two grass coverage rates? This study has the potential to provide new insights into AM fungal resources and biogeographical patterns in subtropical citrus orchards on a regional scale, and to validate a nature-based solution for enriching AM fungal communities in citrus production. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Soil sampling and investigation The soil was sampled from October to November 2019 in subtropical citrus orchards in Guangdong Province, China. A total of 80 sampling sites spanning 179,700 km 2 area were investigated based on the cultivation area of citrus in each administrative region in Guangdong Province published in Guangdong Statistical Yearbook in 2018 ( Fig. 1 ). After removing visible plant litter and gravels, three soil cores of 5 cm diameter and 20 cm depth were collected using a stainless-steel soil auger under the canopy drip line of a citrus tree, and then a total of nine cores from three different citrus trees were pooled and homogenized thoroughly by a sieve with 2-mm pore size as one soil sample (i.e., one sampling site). Subsequently, a soil sample was divided into two sub-samples. A sub-sample was air-dried at room temperature for analysis of soil chemical properties. Another sub-sample was stored at −20 °C for soil DNA extraction. Natural grass coverage rate in citrus orchards was recorded and the species of natural grass were not investigated. The grass coverage rate was divided into five levels, including 0 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 %, and 90 %, according to the description by Ding and Li (2016) . In this study, we define the grass coverage rate of 30 % and below as low grass coverage rate (hereafter referred as LGCR) and the grass coverage rate above 30 % as high grass coverage rate (hereafter referred as HGCR). 2.2 Analysis of soil chemical properties A total of eight soil chemical properties, including soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK), were determined according to the description by Feng et al. (2023a, 2023b) and Carter and Gregorich (2007) . Briefly, soil pH was determined in double-distilled water (a water/soil ratio of 2.5/1 = v/w) with a glass electrode (Alalis, PH300, China). SOM was determined by titration after wet oxidation with H 2 SO 4 and K 2 Cr 2 O 7 . TN, TP, and TK were determined using the Kjeldahl method, the molybdenum blue colorimetric method (Tecan, Infinite M200, Swiss), and the flame photometric method (Analytik Jena, novAA350, Germany), respectively. AN, AP, and AK were determined using the alkali-hydrolyzed reduction diffusing method, the molybdenum blue colorimetric method, and the flame photometric method, respectively. 2.3 DNA extraction and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing Soil DNA extraction and quality examination (i.e., integrity, concentration, and purity) were conducted according to our previous description ( Feng et al., 2023a, 2023b ). Briefly, for each soil sample, soil DNA was extracted twice from 400 mg soil using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and then was pooled into one soil DNA. The quality of extracted soil DNA was examined by 1 % (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and an ultramicro spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, NanoDrop 2000, USA). To improve the specificity of amplified AM fungal 18S rRNA gene, two primer pairs AML1/AML2 ( Lee et al., 2008 ) and AMV4.5NF/AMDGR ( Sato et al., 2005 ) were used in a nested PCR reaction ( Van Geel et al., 2014 ; Feng et al., 2023a ). Furthermore, library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis were described by Feng et al. (2023a) . Briefly, the final PCR products were purified using the AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) and then DNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Applied Biosystems, USA). These products from same sample were mixed at equimolar concentrations as a sequencing pool and then were subjected to sequencing on a MiSeq PE300 platform (Illumina, USA). Raw sequences were merged and then high-quality sequences (≥200 bp with an average quality score > 20) were acquired using the QIIME ( Caporaso et al., 2010 ). After identification and removal of potential chimeric sequences using the USEARCH ( Edgar et al., 2011 ), operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated from the remaining sequences at a 97 % similarity using the UCLUST ( Edgar, 2010 ). Each representative sequence of OTUs was annotated based on the Maarj AM database ( Öpik et al., 2010 ; Liu et al., 2023 ; Wu et al., 2023 ). The OTU abundance matrix was used for the community analysis. The raw sequencing data was deposited in the SRA at the NCBI database under the BioProject ID PRJNA977609. 2.4 Statistical analysis and visualization Statistical analysis and visualization were performed in R version 3.6.1 ( R Core Team, 2013 ). Independent sample t- test and Wilcoxon test were performed. To visualize the cultivation area of citrus in each administrative region in Guangdong Province, we drew a map to show the difference of the cultivation area by the gradation of green color with the ‘maptools’ package ( Bivand and Lewin-Koh, 2013 ). To avoid bias in the downstream analyses of AM fungal community, all soil samples were normalized to 28,169 sequences (i.e., the lowest number of sequences, 28,169–35,968 per sample) by random subsampling with the ‘rrarefy’ function of the ‘vegan’ package ( Sosa-Hernández et al., 2018 ). AM fungal richness indexes (i.e., observed OTUs, Chao1 index, and ACE index) and diversity indexes (i.e., Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index) were calculated with the ‘vegan’ package. The differences in the relative abundance of certain AM fungal taxa between LGCR and HGCR may not truly reflect the differences in their absolute abundance because of the lack of total AM fungal abundance ( Morton et al., 2019 ; Ma et al., 2020 ). Differential ranking analysis was performed to evaluate the log-fold change of AM fungal genera and OTUs that were truly different at two grass coverage rates using multinomial regression as implemented in Songbird ( Morton et al., 2019 ). A heatmap based on Spearman correlation analysis was generated with the ‘corr.test’ function of the ‘psych’ and ‘corrplot’ packages to show the correlation among soil chemical properties, the alpha diversity indices, and AM fungal genera ( Revelle, 2020 ). Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) was performed using the ‘varpart’ and ‘anova.cca’ functions of the ‘vegan’ package to quantify the contributions of grass coverage rate and soil organic matter to the AM fungal richness and diversity represented by observed OTUs and Shannon-Wiener index, respectively. To identify whether the differences of AM fungal community structure between LGCR and HGCR is significant, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were performed with the ‘anosim’ and ‘adonis’ functions of the ‘vegan’ package, respectively. Furthermore, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed with the ‘pcoa’ function of the ‘ape’ and ‘ggplot2’ packages to visualize two AM fungal community structures ( Paradis et al., 2004 ; Wickham, 2011 ). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed with the ‘decorana’, ‘cca’, and ‘envfit’ functions of the ‘vegan’ package to estimate the effects of soil chemical properties on AM fungal community. A Manhattan plot based on P -valve from Wilcoxon test was generated to show the contrasting AM fungal species between LGCR and HGCR, where the contrasting AM fungal species were defined as the OTUs significantly enriched or depleted in HGCR. Core AM fungal species were defined as the OTUs whose relative abundance and occupancy (i.e., the relative frequency of occurrence of certain OTU in all the samples) were >0.1 % and 0.80, respectively ( Shade and Handelsman, 2012 ). The main AM fungal predictors at OTU level (relative abundance ≥ 0.02 %) for the grass coverage rate were identified by random forest analysis with the ‘rfPermute’ package ( Archer, 2013 ). The cross-validated R 2 values and significance were further verified with the ‘A3’ package ( Jiao et al., 2018 ). In general, the biological similarity of microbial community decreases with geographical distance ( Soininen et al., 2007 ). To verify whether there is distance-decay relationship in AM fungal communities of 80 sampling sites along the sampling distances, we calculated all the distances between any two sampling sites based on the longitude and latitude of the sampling sites with the ‘distm’ function of the ‘geosphere’ package, thus producing 3160 distances [(80 × 79) / 2 = 3160] ( Hijmans et al., 2017 ). Then, a distance-decay relationship was shown by using the distance between any two sampling sites and Bray-Curtis similarity in a general linear model. To determine which ecological processes determine AM fungal community assembly in citrus orchards on a regional scale, we performed a null model analysis ( Liu et al., 2023 ). Beta mean nearest taxon distance (βMNTD) was calculated with the ‘comdistnt’ function of the ‘picante’ package (abundance.weighted = TRUE) ( Kembel et al., 2010 ; Stegen et al., 2012, 2013 ). Beta nearest taxon index (βNTI) was defined as the standard deviations of βMNTD ( Stegen et al., 2012 ). Bray-Curtis-based Raup-Crick (RC Bray ) was calculated with the ‘vegdist’ function of the ‘vegan’ package ( Bray and Curtis, 1957 ; Stegen et al., 2015 ). The ecological process of any two communities was determined based the results of βNTI and RC Bray ( Stegen et al., 2015 ; Zhou and Ning, 2017 ). Briefly, five ecological processes were identified, including homogeneous selection (βNTI < −2), heterogeneous selection (βNTI > 2), homogenizing dispersal (|βNTI| < 2 and RC Bray < −0.95), dispersal limitation (|βNTI| < 2 and RC Bray > 0.95), and undominated (|βNTI| < 2 and |RC Bray | < 0.95), based on βNTI and RC Bray . 3 Results 3.1 AM fungal community composition and alpha diversity Most of rarefaction curves of AM fungal OTU reached a steady plateau, indicating a sufficient sequencing depth in this study (Fig. S1). Based on these sequences, 2295 OTUs were generated, belonging to eight genera ( Fig. 2 a ). The relative abundance of three genera, including Glomus (90.15 %), Claroideoglomus (5.68 %), and Acaulospora (2.04 %), is higher than 1 %. More notably, the relative abundance of the dominant genus Glomus significantly increased from 86.32 % at LGCR to 93.98 % at HGCR ( P = 0.018) ( Fig. 2 a). Similarly, the OTU number of the genus Glomus significantly increased from 121.13 at LGCR to 152.70 at HGCR ( P = 0.002) ( Table 1 ). To further investigate whether the differences in the relative abundances of these genera between LGCR and HGCR also existed in their absolute abundances, a differential ranking analysis was performed at the genus level using multinomial regression. The log-fold changes of Scutellospora and Glomus were greater than zero (1.77 and 0.64, respectively), indicating higher absolute abundances of these 2 AM fungal genera at HGCR ( Fig. 2 b). In contrast, the log-fold changes of Claroideoglomus , Paraglomus , and Acaulospora were lesser than zero (−0.13, −0.21, and −1.37, respectively), indicating lower absolute abundances of these three AM fungal genera at HGCR ( Fig. 2 b). All AM fungal alpha diversity indexes (three richness indexes: observed OTUs, Chao1 index, and ACE index; two diversity indexes: Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index) at HGCR were significantly higher than those at LGCR ( P < 0.05) ( Fig. 2 c). Specifically, HGCR significantly increased observed OTUs ( P = 0.008), Chao1 index ( P = 0.012), ACE index ( P = 0.010), Shannon-Wiener index ( P = 0.004), and Simpson's diversity index ( P = 0.007) by 20.90 %, 22.59 %, 23.23 %, 21.32 %, and 16.67 %, respectively ( Fig. 2 c). 3.2 Potential drivers of AM fungal diversity and community Analysis of soil chemical properties showed that SOM, AP, and AP:TP at HGCR were significantly higher than those at LGCR ( P < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 ). Specifically, HGCR significantly increased SOM ( P = 0.015), AP ( P = 0.033), and AP:TP ( P = 0.042) by 20.31 %, 55.39 %, and 32.86 %, respectively ( Fig. 3 ). It is worth noting that the grass coverage rate had the greatest effect on AP in soils. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the remaining soil chemical properties between LGCR and HGCR ( Fig. 3 ). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that SOM had significantly positive correlations with all AM fungal alpha diversity indexes, including observed OTUs (correlation coefficient r = 0.272, P = 0.014), Chao1 index ( r = 0.251, P = 0.025), ACE index ( r = 0.279, P = 0.012), Shannon-Wiener index ( r = 0.306, P = 0.006), and Simpson's diversity index ( r = 0.326, P = 0.003) ( Fig. 4 and Fig. S2). Soil pH had a significantly positive correlation with observed OTUs ( r = 0.249, P = 0.026) ( Figs. 4 and S2). AK:TK had significantly positive correlations with Chao1 index ( r = 0.222, P = 0.047) and ACE index ( r = 0.226, P = 0.044) ( Figs. 4 and S2). In contrast, AP:TP had significantly negative correlations with observed OTUs ( r = −0.239, P = 0.033) and Shannon-Wiener index ( r = −0.252, P = 0.024) ( Figs. 4 and S2). The relative abundance of Glomus had significantly positive correlations with AP ( r = 0.306, P = 0.006) and AP:TP ( r = 0.380, P = 0.001), and had a significantly negative correlation with AN ( r = −0.275, P = 0.014) ( Fig. 4 ). However, the relative abundance of the second dominant genus, Claroideoglomus , had significantly negative correlations with AP ( r = −0.447, P < 0.001) and AP:TP ( r = −0.461, P < 0.001) ( Fig. 4 ). Considering that both grass coverage rate and SOM could affect the AM fungal alpha diversity, VPA was performed to quantify their respective contribution. VPA revealed that grass coverage rate and SOM collectively explained 26.36 % of variation in AM fungal richness ( Fig. 5 a ) and 21.28 % of variation in AM fungal diversity ( Fig. 5 b), although most of the variation was unexplained. Grass coverage rate independently explained more variation in AM fungal richness (23.37 %, P < 0.001) and diversity (18.01 %, P < 0.001) than SOM did (7.89 %, P = 0.003, 7.63 %, P = 0.008). Beta diversity analysis showed that the grass coverage rate significantly shifted the AM fungal community structures (ANOSIM: R = 0.043, P = 0.020; PERMANOVA: R 2 = 0.029, P = 0.015) ( Fig. 5 c). Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that six edaphic factors, including TK (determination coefficient r 2 = 0.458, P = 0.001), AN:TN ( r 2 = 0.275, P = 0.009), AP ( r 2 = 0.248, P = 0.001), TP ( r 2 = 0.239, P = 0.010), SOM ( r 2 = 0.152, P = 0.005), and pH ( r 2 = 0.148, P = 0.008), significantly affected AM fungal community ( Fig. 5 d and Table S1). The low proportion (8.34 %) explained by the edaphic factors probably indicate that some factors other than soil chemical properties exerted essential roles on the AM fungal community ( Fig. 5 d). 3.3 Contrasting and core AM fungal species To find out the contrasting AM fungal species between LGCR and HGCR, the OTUs, whose relative abundances were >0.02 % and significantly affected by grass coverage rate ( P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), were investigated and further shown by Manhattan plot ( Fig. 6 a ). HGCR significantly enriched 19 OTUs (15.97 %) and depleted 6 OTUs (5.04 %). Importantly, all significantly enriched and depleted OTUs belonged to the genus Glomus ( Fig. 6 a). Moreover, OTU4 ( Glomus _VTX00270) had the highest relative abundance (5.48 %) and was significantly enriched in HGCR; while OTU7 ( Glomus _VTX00126) had the highest relative abundance (4.68 %) and was significantly depleted in HGCR ( Fig. 6 a). Differential ranking analysis was performed at OTU level and the log-fold change between LGCR and HGCR of 313 OTUs was ranked by performing multinomial regression. The log-fold changes of 15 out of 19 OTUs significantly enriched in HGCR were greater than zero, ranging from 0.57 to 3.36; while the log-fold changes of 4 out of 6 OTUs significantly depleted in HGCR were lesser than zero, ranging from −0.38 to −2.25 ( Fig. 6 b). These results indicated that most of the OTUs that differ significantly in relative abundance between LGCR and HGCR also differ in absolute abundance. To further find out the core AM fungal species in 80 sampling sites, we investigated the OTUs, whose relative abundances were >0.1 % and were detected in at least 80 % sites (occupancy ≥ 0.80). A total of eight OTUs were defined as the core AM fungal species, including OTU4 (occupancy = 0.91, relative abundance = 5.48 %) and OTU7 (occupancy = 0.85, relative abundance = 4.68 %) ( Fig. 7 a and Table S2). Importantly, all of core AM fungal species belonged to the genus Glomus (Table S2). We further evaluated the biological contributions of the AM fungal OTUs to grass coverage rate via a random forest regression ( Fig. 7 b). The random forest model explained 26.29 % of the variation in grass coverage rate ( R 2 = 0.2629, P < 0.001). Three significant predictors were identified ( P < 0.05), among which OTU4 was the most important (Increase in MSE % = 17.96 %), followed by OTU69 (Increase in MSE % = 14.90 %), and OTU81 (Increase in MSE % = 8.73 %) ( Fig. 7 b). In addition, we also established a random forest classification to define biomarkers to differentiate AM fungal communities at LGCR and HGCR. After tenfold cross-validation, ten OTUs exhibited the lowest error rates which were therefore defined as biomarker taxa, among which OTU4 was the most important biomarker taxon (Fig. S3). Furthermore, 9 out of 10 OTUs significantly enriched in HGCR, and one OTU significantly depleted in HGCR (Fig. S3). 3.4 The ecological process of AM fungal community We observed a significantly distance-decay relationship that the community similarity of AM fungi had a significantly negative correlation with the geographical distance among sampling sites ( R 2 = 0.007, P < 0.001) ( Fig. 8 a ). To further decipher the ecological process of the community assembly on a regional scale, null model analysis was performed. Based on all sampling sites, determinism (54.53 %) played a slightly larger role in the assembly processes of AM fungal community than stochasticity (45.47 %). The assembly processes of AM fungal community were significantly different between LGCR and HGCR ( P < 0.001) ( Fig. 8 b). Moreover, determinism (61.41 %) played a larger role in the assembly processes of AM fungal community than stochasticity (38.59 %) at LGCR; while determinism (49.23 %) and stochasticity (50.77 %) played a similar role in the assembly processes of AM fungal community at HGCR ( Fig. 8 b). Specifically, heterogeneous selection (54.46 %) was the most important ecological process in AM fungal community assembly, followed by undominated (38.10 %), dispersal limitation (7.19 %), homogenizing dispersal (0.19 %), and homogeneous selection (0.06 %) ( Fig. 8 c). 4 Discussion 4.1 Glomus is the dominant and keystone taxon in subtropical citrus orchards A large number of AM fungal isolates have been identified from a variety of ecosystems, including citrus orchards. According to Wu and Zou (2014) , 45 species belonging to seven genera of indigenous AM fungi have been isolated from citrus orchards. We previously collected 28 AM fungal isolates based on the spore morphological features from one citrus orchard ( Feng et al., 2023a ). These results suggest that citrus orchards harbor abundant AM fungi. In the study, we identified eight genera of AM fungi in soils from 80 sampling sites. Remarkably, Glomus accounted for 90.15 % of the community in terms of OTU abundance, highlighting the dominance of Glomus in citrus orchards. Approximately 346 AM fungal species are currently validly described and Glomus is one of the most inclusive genera, comprising 53 species ( https://amf-phylogeny.jimdofree.com/species-list/ , last updated on Jan. 14, 2023). Meanwhile, Glomus is the most widely distributed genus, occurring in various orchard ecosystems ( Sharma et al., 2009 ; Wang et al., 2011 ; Huang et al., 2019 ; Jiang et al., 2020 ). Soil P, especially AP, is one of the most critical edaphic factors influencing the colonization and growth of AM fungi ( Xiao et al., 2019 ; Dueñas et al., 2020 ; Qin et al., 2020 ). In recent five decades (1961–2015), the amount of global P fertilizer applied to agricultural ecosystems has increased from 4.6 million tons per annum to approximately 21 million tons per annum and has maintained an increasing trend up to now ( Mogollón et al., 2018 ; Bindraban et al., 2020 ). Overall, we found that the AP content in soils from 80 sampling sites was high and the average content was 181.70 mg kg −1 (142.29 mg kg −1 at LGCR, 221.10 mg kg −1 at HGCR). High AP generally suppresses AM fungal colonization, sporulation, hyphal density, and community diversity in soils ( Yoshimura et al., 2012 ; Sheng et al., 2013 ; Xu et al., 2018 ; Qin et al., 2020 ). In this study, only the relative abundance of Glomus had significantly positive correlations with AP and AP:TP; by contrast, those of other seven genera had no significant correlations or even significantly negative correlations with AP and AP:TP, indicating a stronger tolerance and competitiveness of Glomus in agricultural soils with high AP content ( Fig. 9 ). In addition, all the contrasting AM fungal species between LGCR and HGCR as well as all the core AM fungal species from 80 sampling sites belonged to Glomus . These features may have given Glomus a wide range of ecological adaptations and environmental responses, allowing the genus to occur abundantly in almost all citrus orchards in this study. Many pot culture experiments demonstrated that the isolates of Glomus often show positive effects and promote plant growth of diverse woody plant species, especially citrus plants ( Frosi et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ; Hadian-Deljou et al., 2020 ). Since Glomus is the dominant AM fungal taxa in citrus orchards in this study, it is possible that these indigenous AM fungi contribute to the tolerance of citrus plants to seasonal drought ( Wu et al., 2013 ), which represents an important obstacle to citrus production in southern China ( Tu et al., 2021 ). 4.2 Grass coverage determines soil chemical properties and AM fungal communities Effects of grass coverage on soil chemical properties, enzyme activities, and microbial diversity have been extensively recognized ( Cui et al., 2015 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2021 ; Xiang et al., 2023 ). In this study, HGCR significantly increased SOM, AP, and AP:TP by 20.31 %, 55.39 %, and 32.86 %, respectively. Remarkably, the greatest rate of increase occurred in the AP under the premise that there is no significant shift in TP, indicating a higher active P-turnover from unavailable P to AP at HGCR. Soil microbes involved in this process include not only AM fungi but also phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), which were found to be abundant and diverse in citrus orchards ( Liu et al., 2020b ; Qin et al., 2022 ). Our previous study revealed that the grass coverage by planting Paspalum natatu or Stylosanthes guianensis in a subtropical orchard could increase SOM and the species richness of PSB, enhancing acid, neutral, and alkaline phosphomonoesterase activities ( Cui et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, recent studies showed that AM fungi-PSB interactions in hyphosphere enhanced the mineralization of organic P ( Jiang et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2023 ). In brief, HGCR increased SOM and might enhance microbial interactions involved in P turnover, resulting in increased P availability in soils ( Fig. 9 ). External factors determining AM fungal community in orchards can be diverse, including AP, soil organic carbon, acidity, cover cropping, and mechanical tillage ( Yoshimura et al., 2012 ; Van Geel et al., 2017 ; Lombardo et al., 2019 ; Pellegrino et al., 2020 ). Grass coverage in orchards has been highly recommended for decades. In this study, HGCR with natural grasses significantly increased AM fungal diversity. Similar effects, such as increasing AM fungal diversity and activity (mycorrhizal inoculum potential), of grass coverage on AM fungi were reported previously ( Wang et al., 2016 ; Turrini et al., 2017 ; Pellegrino et al., 2020 ). Importantly, SOM was the only edaphic factor that had significant positive correlations with all AM fungal alpha diversity indexes. VPA further revealed that both grass coverage rate and SOM significantly explained the variation in AM fungal richness and diversity, with the former accounting for 2–4 times more variation than the latter, although most of the variation was unexplained. The result indicated that there were at least two pathways for grass coverage rate to affect the AM fungal alpha diversity: the first was through affecting SOM, the second was the direct effect of grass coverage rate, and the latter was more primary ( Fig. 9 ). AM fungi are obligate symbiotic fungi, whose proliferation and functionality strongly depend on the carbon sources from host plants in the forms of sugars and lipids ( Roth and Paszkowski, 2017 ; Feng et al., 2020a, 2020b ). In addition, many previous studies showed that AM fungi have host preference in various ecosystems ( Martínez-García and Pugnaire, 2011 ; Bittebiere et al., 2020 ; Senés-Guerrero et al., 2020 ). Therefore, in citrus orchards, higher grass coverage rate could provide more choices and nutrients (e.g., sugars and lipids) for AM fungi in soils to establish and maintain the symbioses. Collectively, these studies suggest that grass coverage in orchards is an appropriate nature-based solution compatible with AM fungal biotechnology. 4.3 Grass coverage affects the assembly processes of AM fungal community in citrus orchards Understanding the ecological process of AM fungal communities is essential for the manipulation and application of indigenous AM fungi. In this study, determinism (54.53 %) was slightly more dominant than stochasticity (45.47 %) based on all the samples in citrus orchards on a regional scale. However, the relative importance of stochasticity increased from 38.59 % to 50.77 % with increasing grass coverage rate, indicating a positive correlation between grass coverage rate and stochasticity. The effects of plant communities including host plants and non-host plants, especially natural plant communities, on AM fungi are complex and difficult to predict because of the interspecific and intraspecific plant interactions ( Kokkoris et al., 2020 ). Based on this, once the species and abundance of grass communities decrease, or even disappear (grass coverage rate = 0 %), the plant factors affecting AM fungal communities in citrus orchards were reduced, resulting in the decreased importance of stochasticity and the increased importance of determinism. A previous work by Lekberg et al. (2007) indicated the role of environment and interspecific competition in AM fungal community assembly on a local scale. However, Shi et al. (2014) found that both stochasticity and determinism were involved in the AM fungal community assembly during the spreading of toxic plants in an alpine meadow, and the relative importance of both processes changed with the spreading of toxic plants. Additionally, the relative importance of stochasticity and determinism depends on the spatial scale of sampling ( Chaudhary et al., 2014 ). It is likely that in this study, natural grass coverage on a regional scale led to an increase in the relative importance of stochasticity in the assembly processes of AM fungal communities. 5 Conclusions In conclusion, we investigated indigenous AM fungal communities in subtropical citrus orchards spanning 179,700 km 2 area and detected abundant AM fungal taxa, including eight genera in which Glomus dominates. Natural grass coverage increased soil chemical properties (e.g., SOM, AP, and AP:TP) and enriched AM fungal communities (e.g., richness and diversity), especially Glomus , on a regional scale. Natural grass coverage affected AM fungal communities through the regulation of Glomus . Based on the results of the null model analysis, natural grass coverage increased the relative importance of stochasticity in the AM fungal community assembly, with a similar importance between determinism and stochasticity on a regional scale. Our results provide ecological evidence for natural grass coverage enriching AM fungal communities in subtropical citrus on a regional scale, as well as insights into the natural grass coverage regulating AM fungal communities.
