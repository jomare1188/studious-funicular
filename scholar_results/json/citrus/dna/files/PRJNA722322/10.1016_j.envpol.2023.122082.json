    "full_text": "Contamination from external hazardous materials may greatly influence the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines. This paper aimed to evaluate the levels of contamination by mycotoxins and toxigenic fungi in herbal medicines and establish a rapid method for detecting toxin-producing fungi. Herein, 62.92%, 36.25%, and 64.17% of herbal medicines were contaminated by aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxins, and fumonisins, respectively. Aspergillus (43.77%), Fusarium (5.17%), and Cladosporium (4.46%) were the three predominant genera. Spearman's correlation results showed that Aspergillus and Fusarium were significantly and positively correlated with mycotoxin content (R > 0.5, P < 0.05). In addition, 323 fungal strains were isolated from herbal medicines, and 20 species were identified, mainly belonging to Aspergillus and Penicillium . Analysis of potential mycotoxin-producing fungi showed that Aspergillus flavus can produce AFs, and Aspergillus ochraceus and Aspergillus niger can produce ochratoxin A (OTA). Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that A. flavus harbored AF synthesis genes ( aflR ), and A. ochraceus and A. niger harbored OTA synthesis genes ( aoksl ). With these synthesis genes, 67.07% and 37.20% of 164 herbal medicines were positive for toxigenic genes. Furthermore, an excellent correlation was found between the above gene copies and mycotoxin content (R 2 = 0.99). Our results confirmed the high detection rate of mycotoxins in herbal medicines and identified pivotal AF- and OTA-producing fungi. In conclusion, this paper provided the contamination status of fungi and mycotoxins in herbal medicines and established a rapid method for detecting toxigenic fungi."

          "Herbal medicines are widely used to treat various ailments worldwide ( Ahmad et al., 2014 ). In China, herbal medicines were used in 91.50% of the COVID-19 cases and alleviated the symptoms and reduced the mortality and recurrence rates ( Luo et al., 2020 ). About 80% of the world's population relies on herbal medicines for primary healthcare, and the global herbal medicine market reached approximately 107 billion dollars in 2017 ( Luo et al., 2021 ). Some herbs, such as Panax notoginseng and Panax ginseng , have become important dietary supplements ( Wei et al., 2018 ; Mancuso et al., 2017). E xcessive levels of extrinsic hazardous materials (including mycotoxins, pesticides, heavy metals, and sulfur dioxide) were detected in herbal medicines ( Liu et al., 2018 ). These materials exert adverse effects on human health and have caused a global health concern ( Chen et al., 2020 ; Do et al., 2015 ).",
          "Mycotoxins trigger various ailments affecting the kidney, skin, liver, and nervous system ( Do et al., 2015 ). Currently, more than 400 different mycotoxins have been identified (Zinedine et al., 2009). In humans and animals, the most harmful mycotoxins are aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxins (OTs), and fumonisins (FBs; Binder et al., 2007 ). AFs are the most toxic mycotoxins for humans and animals, particularly aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), which is the most frequently detected metabolite and has been classified as a group IA carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC; Sardiñas et al., 2011 ). FBs can cause liver and kidney toxicity, carcinogenicity, immunosuppression, and neurotoxicity ( Bittencourt et al., 2005 ). Ochratoxin A (OTA) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) have been classified as group IIB carcinogens by the IARC ( Chen et al., 2015 ; IARC, 1993 ). Reports about mycotoxin contamination in medicinal herbs and related products indicated that AFs, OTs, and FBs are the most common contaminants ( Zhang et al., 2018 ). The natural occurrence of mycotoxins in herbal medicines and their products has been reported in various countries ( Ashiq et al., 2014 ). For example, in Chinese herbal medicines, the mean levels (incidence) of AFB1, aflatoxin B2 (AFB2), aflatoxin G1 (AFG1), and aflatoxin G2 (AFG2) were 1.40, 1.27, 0.50, and 0.94 μg/kg, respectively ( Han et al., 2010a ). In 700 herbal medicine samples from South Korea, 58 (8.29%) were confirmed AFB1 positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and 17 (2.43%) were finally confirmed as positive for total AFs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( Shim et al., 2012 ). High levels of AFB1 (52.0 μg/kg) and OTA (92.3 μg/kg) were detected in platycladi and tangerine seeds, respectively ( Chen et al., 2015 ). Thus, the severity of mycotoxin contamination in herbal medicines cannot be underestimated, and for drug safety and consumer interests, mycotoxin content must be examined before herbs are marketed.",
          "Moreover, toxigenic fungi infecting herbal medicines and producing mycotoxins as natural contaminants affect the quality and safety of herbal medicines. The mismanagement of herbal medicines during growth, processing, storage, and transportation leads to severe spoilage, along with toxigenic fungal and mycotoxin contamination ( Chen et al., 2020 ). Different taxa of fungi are detected in medicinal plants, and Aspergillus and Penicillium are the most predominant genera ( Moorthy et al., 2010 ). However, few studies have discussed the diversity and composition of fungal communities on the surfaces of herbal medicines. High-throughput sequencing can provide the mass data of microbial communities in low abundance levels and has been applied to soil and fermented products ( Dong et al., 2016 ; Ezekiel et al., 2019 ), providing a way to explore the diversity and composition of fungal communities in herbal medicines. Several Aspergillus , Fusarium , Alternaria , and Penicillium strains are mycotoxin producers that produce AFs, FBs, and OTs ( Zheng et al., 2014 ; Geisen et al., 2004 ). Mycotoxins are fungal secondary metabolites, but the occurrence of fungal communities in herbal medicines and their interactions with mycotoxins have not been systematically studied. Therefore, the isolation and verification of mycotoxin-producing fungi can facilitate the identification of potential mycotoxin sources in herbal medicines.",
          "Biosynthetic genes involved in secondary metabolites are often clustered in fungi and facilitate the coordination of transcriptional activation and regulation (Shwab et al., 2008). An increasing number of studies have focused on elucidating the pathways of mycotoxin biosynthesis, and the complete gene clusters involved in mycotoxin biosynthesis have been identified ( Gil-Serna et al., 2020 ). For example, omtA , ordA , ver-1 , and aflR are the key genes involved in AF biosynthesis; otanps and aoksl are the key genes involved in OTA biosynthesis; and fum1 , fum2 , fum3 , fum4 , fum6 , fum8 , fum13 , and tri5 are the key genes involved in FB biosynthesis ( Han et al., 2012 ). Developments in research into the mycotoxin biosynthesis pathway increases have facilitated the design of the specific probes of the key genes. Multiple real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to detect key genes at the molecular level and has provided evidence of contamination of toxic fungi ( Rahman et al., 2020 ). Therefore, a multiple real-time fluorescent PCR method for the key genes of mycotoxin biosynthesis can be established for the rapid identification of mycotoxin-producing fungi in herbal medicines.",
          "Hence, the objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to determine the occurrence of mycotoxins and fungal communities in herbal medicines by using ELISA and high-throughput sequencing; (2) to predict toxigenic fungi that mainly produce mycotoxins on the basis of Spearman's correlation analysis; (3) to confirm the potential mycotoxin-producing capacities of culturable strains by traditional culture methods; and (4) to establish a method for rapidly identifying mycotoxin-producing fungi by multiple real-time fluorescent PCR. This work will provide a scientific basis for the formulation of a standard for mycotoxin level and for the early risk warning of mycotoxin contamination in herbal medicines."

              "Mycotoxin contamination mainly occurs during the harvesting, processing, transportation, and storage of herbal medicines. Therefore, a comprehensive survey was conducted in large-scale areas covering major herbal medicine markets in China, and few samples were obtained from Southeast Asia. A total of 240 samples of 80 kinds of most commonly used herbal medicines were selected according to their medicinal parts: radix and rhizoma (36 kinds), flos (5 kinds), fructus and semen (20 kinds), folium and cortex (11 kinds), and herba and others (8 kinds), as shown in Supplemental File: Dataset S1. Each sample was divided into three subsamples. One subsample was analyzed for the occurrence of mycotoxins, one was used to analyze the diversity and composition of microbial communities, and one was used for the isolation and identification of toxic fungi. These samples were processed as soon as possible to prevent second contamination."

              "Herein, 240 herbal medicine subsamples were ground, homogenized, sieved, and stored in polyethylene bags and used for mycotoxin detection. AF content was detected using an ELISA test kit for AFs (RNM98001, 96T, REAGEN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Hu et al., 2018 ). 5 g of sample was accurately weighed and placed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, 25 mL of methanol solution was added, and sonication was performed for 3 min at room temperature. Moreover, 1 mL of liquid was placed in a 2 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 rpm. Subsequently, 100 μL of supernatant was diluted with 500 μL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution to prepare the sample solution. For OT content analysis, medicinal samples were prepared and extracted using an ELISA test kit for OTs (RNM98008, 96T, REAGEN, USA; Sun et al., 2019 ). Briefly, 1 g of medicinal samples was weighed and mixed with 2 mL of 50% methanol–PBS solution. After vigorous shaking for 10 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted 1:5 with PBS prior to test with ELISA test kit. FB extraction and tests were performed with an FB ELISA test kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNM98009, 96T, REAGEN, USA; Ghali et al., 2009 ). 5 g of sample was extracted with 25 mL of 70% methanol. The extract was filtered, and 1 mL of filtered sample was then diluted with 13 mL of distilled water. 50 μL of diluted filtrate per well was used for the ELISA test. Afterward, the absorbance value was determined with a microplate reader at 450 nm, and AF, OT, and FB content were calculated. Linear regression analysis was performed with a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.991, 0.993, and 0.998 for AFs, FBs, and OTs, respectively (Supplemental File: Table S1 ). The recovery rates for AFs, FBs, and OTs are quite efficient, ranging from 85.32% ± 2.32%–87.91% ± 4.85%.",
              "Furthermore, positive samples (medicinal herbs for which mycotoxins tested by the above ELISA kits) were confirmed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QQQ-MS) to prevent false positives. Sample separation was performed on a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column (100 mm × 3 mm, 1.8 μm, Agilent). The conditions for AFs and OTA were as follows: the column temperature was 30 °C, the flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, and the injection volume was 1 μL ( Yang et al., 2016 ). The mobile phase was composed of (A) water containing 0.1% HCOOH and (B) methanol containing 0.1% HCOOH. The gradient elution program was set as follows: 0–3.5 min, 45% B; 3.5–4.5 min, 45%–75% B; 4.5–10 min, 75% B. The mass spectrometer was optimized in the multiple reaction monitoring mode, and the positive electrospray ion [ESI + ] polarity was employed. Then, high-purity nitrogen was used as the drying and ionization gas. The capillary voltage, source temperature, and desolvation temperature were 2.50 kV, 150 °C, and 350 °C, respectively. The conditions for FBs were set as follows: the column temperature was 35 °C, flow rate was 0.3 mL/min, and injection volume was 1 μL ( Qian et al., 2012 ). The mobile phase was composed of (A) water containing 0.1% HCOOH and (B) methanol-acetonitrile (v/v, 50/50). The gradient elution program was set as follows: 0–2.3 min, 30%–70% B; 2.3–4.0 min, 70% B; 4–4.2 min, 70%–100% B. The capillary voltage, source temperature, and desolvation temperature were 3.50 kV, 120 °C, and 350 °C, respectively. The parameters on the m/z and collision energy of parent ions, primary daughter ions, secondary daughter ions, standard curve, linearity ( R 2 ), and recovery for the analysis of AFs, OTA, and FBs are shown in Supplemental File: Table S2 . Linear regression analysis was performed with correlation coefficient (R 2 ) ranging from 0.9995 to 0.9999. The recovery rates for mycotoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, FB1, FB2, and OTA) ranged from 95.84% ± 2.09%–100.80% ± 1.86%."

              "10 g of each herbal medicine subsample was transferred to a 250 mL sterilized conical flask. Then, 190 mL of sterile water and 20 glass beads were added. The flasks were shaken for 20 min at 130 rpm. Total DNA was extracted from the sediments after centrifugation with PowerWater DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Al-gabr et al., 2014 ). Moreover, ITS rRNA gene fragments were amplified using the fungal primers ITS1F/ITS2R ( Adams et al., 2013 ). The amplification program was set as follows: pre-denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 52 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were purified using an agarose gel DNA extraction kit, quantified with Qubit 3.0 (Life Invitrogen, Germany), and placed on an Illumina PE 250 platform (Shanghai Biozeron Co., Ltd., China) for paired-end (2 × 250 bp) sequencing ( Dong et al., 2018a ; Dong et al., 2018b ). The fastq files were input into the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the accession number was PRJNA722322. Raw sequence reads were de-multiplexed and quality filtered with QIIME (v 1.9.0; Caporaso et al., 2010b ). High-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a 97% similarity cutoff obtained by UPARSE software (v 10; Edgar et al., 2011 ). Moreover, the phylogenetic affiliation of ITS rRNA representative sequence was performed using the Ribosomal Database Project classifier (v 2.2) against the Unite (v 8.2) databases (Release 132; Kõljalg et al., 2013 ).",
              "For fungal microbiome comparisons, samples were grouped according to medicinal type (radix and rhizoma group, flos group, fructus and semen group, folium and cortex group, and herba and others group) and mycotoxin content (mycotoxin-free group, mycotoxin-contaminated group, and mycotoxin-excessive group). Herein, alpha diversity indices (i.e., Chao 1 and Shannon) were calculated by mothur (v.1.30.1), and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination (NMDS) analysis based on unweighted distance metrics was performed to determine taxonomic dissimilarity among groups ( Schloss et al., 2009 ; Caporaso et al., 2010a ). One-way ANOVA was performed to measure significant difference in fungal diversity among groups. Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was conducted to test significant differences among groups ( Oksanen et al., 2007 ). A Venn diagram was used in identifying unique and shared OTUs in different groups with R (v2.15.1, Wei et al., 2021 ). Circos plots showing the distribution proportion of core fungal microbiota were visualized using Circos table viewer1 ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 ). The correlation between fungal community abundance and mycotoxin content was calculated through Spearman rank correlation test using corr. test function in psych package (Revelle et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2009)."

The obtained fungal colonies were then transferred to a fresh PDA medium and ascertained for purity.",
              "The purified isolates were microscopically identified according to the manual of fungal identification, and the total DNA of purified fungal isolates was extracted using Fungal DNA Mini Kit (OMEGA, USA; Zheng et al., 2017 ). Then, PCR amplification was performed, and the PCR products were sequenced. The obtained sequences were analyzed with the BLAST program ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) in the NCBI for the identification of the genera and species of the fungal isolates (similarity ≥98%; Wu et al., 2013 ). A neighbor-joining tree was performed based on multiple sequence alignment using MEGA 5.0 with bootstrap replications ( Tamura et al., 2011 ).",

The number of common and unique OTUs in the five groups is shown in the Venn diagram ( Fig. 2 C). Overall, 1,497, 206, 551, 433, and 156 OTUs were obtained from radix and rhizoma, flos, fructus and semen, folium and cortex, and herba and others, respectively. NMDS analyses based on unweighted dissimilarities showed that different medicinal types markedly affected the composition of fungal communities (R = 0.12, P = 0.002, ANOSIM test analysis; Fig. 2 D). Herein, fungal communities in different medicinal types were analyzed at the phylum and genus levels ( Fig. 2 E–F and Supplemental File: Figs. S2–S3 and Tables S4–S5 ). At the phylum level, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota displayed significant compartment specificity ( P < 0.05).

The morphology and microstructures of the partial primary strains are shown in Supplemental File: Fig. S4 . The Aspergillus and Penicillium were the predominant genera in our culturable fungi, similar to our sequencing results. The analysis of potential mycotoxin-producing fungi showed that mycotoxins were detected in three strains ( A. flavus , A. niger , and A. ochraceus ; Fig. 5 ). For A. niger , the colony grew rapidly and was initially white before turning black and plush; the conidium head was brown-black and radiating, the meristem varied in length, the apical capsule was spherical, the pedicel was double, and the conidia were brown and spherical ( Fig. 5 A). The A. flavus colony grew rapidly and had a loose structure and pale-yellow surface. The mycelium was composed of various complex branching hyphae, and the vegetative hyphae were separated. In addition, the mycelium formed long and rough conidia and had flask-shaped or nearly spherical apical sacs at the top, and various pedicels with spherical conidia with rough surfaces were observed ( Fig. 5 B). The A. ochraceus colony grew rapidly and was flat, and velvety. The conidium head was brown and black, the apical capsule was spherical and lagger, and the conidia were spherical ( Fig. 5 C).",

          "A total of 240 herbal medicine samples were analyzed for mycotoxins contamination. Approximately 62.92%, 36.25%, and 64.17% of the samples were contaminated with AFs, OTs, and FBs, respectively. A previous study showed that 50 out of 60 (83.3% of incidence) herbal medicines were contaminated with mycotoxins at concentrations ranging from 1.7 μg/kg to 48.0 μg/kg ( Han et al., 2012 ). AFs are potent mutagens and carcinogens, and 15.5% of traditional Chinese medicine samples were positive for AFs with concentrations of up to 290.8 μg/kg; 5.71% of the positive samples exceeded the proposed limits ( Liu et al., 2012 ). OTA exerts nephrotoxic, teratogenic, neurotoxic, and hepatotoxic effects (Petzinger et al., 2000). Eight (26.7%) samples were contaminated with OTA at concentrations ranging from 9.85 μg/kg to 125 μg/kg ( Ahmad et al., 2014 ). FB contamination in medicinal plants has been reported, and 75% of samples were found contaminated with FB1 with an average concentration of 0.315 μg/kg (Karbancioglu-Güler et al., 2009). More than 50% of traditional Chinese medicine samples were contaminated with FBs (0.58–88.95 μg/kg); 94.4%, 77.8%, and 33.3% of the samples were contaminated with FB1, FB2, and FB3, respectively ( Han et al., 2010b ). The maximum limits of 10 μg/kg for total AFs in some herbal medicines have been set by the Chinese Pharmacopeia, OTs are regulated at 20 μg/kg in the European Pharmacopeia, and FBs are regulated at 1000 μg/kg in the European Union Commission Regulation ( CPC, 2020 ; EP, 20 11; EC, 2007). In our paper, 24.17%, 3.33%, and 6.25% of samples exceeded content of AFs (10 μg/kg), OTs (20 μg/kg), and FBs (1000 μg/kg). A previous study showed that 10 samples (5.71%) exceeded the AF content (10 μg/kg) in 174 herbal medicine samples ( Romagnoli et al., 2007 ). Some medicinal plants and related products sold commercially may be contaminated with high levels of mycotoxins because of the lack of official legislation. To guarantee drug safety and consumer interests, official legislation on the maximum limits of common mycotoxins in herbal medicines should be formulated and implemented.",
          "Seeds had a higher level of FB contamination (90%) than rhizomes and roots, grasses and leaves, and flowers in the herbal medicine samples ( Siddique et al., 2013 ). Our results showed that the over-limit ratios of mycotoxins were higher in the radix and rhizoma, fructus and semen, and folium and cortex than the over-limit ratio in herba and others. Herbal medicines are rich in starch and oil, which might promote mycotoxin production ( Ying et al., 2016 ). In particular, the contamination levels of some samples (i.e., Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Polygini Multiflori Radix, Angelicae Dahuricae Radix, Corni Fructus, and Amomi Fructus) were notable, as they had high sugar, fat, or starch content (Zain et al., 2011). The different mycotoxin levels in herbal medicines results from fungal growth rates, which were affected by some factors, such as storage temperature and moisture level ( Liu et al., 2012 ). In other words, herbal medicines are easily contaminated by all kinds of molds that produce various mycotoxins, and the process is complicated by intrinsic (i.e., chemical composition) and extrinsic environmental (i.e., temperature and moisture) factors. Contamination not only affects the quality of herbal medicines and resulting in enormous financial loss but also influences the safety and effectiveness of herbal medicines, posing potential threats to human health. Therefore, herbs should be dried as soon as possible after harvesting, and appropriate measures, such as the “antagonistic storage” method based on the “couplet medicine” technique should be performed during the storage of herbal medicines ( Ying et al., 2016 ). The “couplet medicine” technique is based on the principle of “protecting herbal medicines with other herbal medicines.” Two kinds of herbal medicines are stored together and prevent mildew while competing with each other, exhibiting no obvious changes in color, smell, and quality. As a green, safe, and economic strategy for preserving herbal medicines, the “antagonistic storage” method is based on the above mode and principle of “couplet medicine” technique to protect herbal medicines from being moldy.",
          "Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi, such as Aspergillus , Penicillium , Fusarium , and Alternaria (Zain et al., 2011). Approximately 92% of medicinal herbs and spices collected from India are contaminated by fungi, and 47% exceeded the permissible limits of the WHO (Aiko et al., 2016). High-throughput sequencing is a potential approach for investigating the fungal contamination in herbal medicines and ensuring drug efficacy ( Luo et al., 2019 ). We applied high-throughput sequencing to study fungal contamination in 240 herbal medicines. Our sequencing results showed that the richness and diversity of fungal communities varied among the herbal medicines. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most predominant phyla, consistent to a previous study ( Jiang et al., 2020 ). The most predominant genus was Aspergillus , followed by Fusarium , Cladosporium , Alternaria , Penicillium , and Xeromyces in our herbal medicines; a similar phenomenon was shown in previous studies ( Yu et al., 2020 ). In Ziziphi Spinosae Semen samples, Ascomycota, Aspergillus , Candida , and Wallemia were the dominant fungi ( Guo et al., 2018 ). In the Cassiae Semen samples, Ascomycota, Aspergillus , Cladosporium , and Penicillium were the prevailing fungi . These studies showed that Ascomycota, Aspergillus , and Penicillium were the most common contaminants and potentially produce mycotoxins. Meanwhile, difference in fungal community among the five groups with different medicinal types was found. Especially, the abundances of P en icillium and Xeromyces were significantly enriched in fructus and semen and radix and rhizoma groups, which had high sugar, fat, or starch content. The chemical composition of herbal medicines might be the main factor influencing the fungal microbiota.",
          "Furthermore, difference in fungal community among the three groups (mycotoxin-free, -contaminated, and -excessive groups) was observed. The Chao1 and Shannon indices of the fungal microbiome in the mycotoxin-free group were higher than those of the mycotoxin-excessive and -contaminated groups. This result was consistent with the findings of other studies and indicated that fungal microbiome diversity was reduced in the presence of mycotoxin contamination ( Ding et al., 2015 ; Yuan et al., 2018 ). In a previous study, difference in fungal diversity between aflatoxin-contaminated and -free Platycladi Semen samples was observed, and mycotoxin-producing fungi associated with mycotoxin content was found in Platycladi Semen ( Yu et al., 2020 ). Spearman's correlation results showed that fungal abundance (e.g., Aspergillus Fusarium , and Penicillium ) was significantly correlated with the content of mycotoxins (e.g., AFs, OTA, and FBs). Notably, the presence of these potential mycotoxin-producing fungi is a necessary prerequisite for mycotoxin contamination. In addition, Aspergillus , Fusarium , Penicillium , and Alternaria spp. were the most frequently detected genera contaminating food and herbal medicines and contained the majority of mycotoxin producers ( Zheng et al., 2017 ). AFs were produced by Aspergillus (Bennett et al., 2003), OTA was mainly produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. ( Ashiq et al., 2014 ), and FBs were mainly produced by various Fusarium spp. under diverse environmental conditions (Karbancioglu-Güler et al., 2009).",
          "Fungi were isolated from the herbal medicines to verify potential mycotoxin producers. The results showed that Aspergillus and Penicillium were the most predominant genera, similar to our high-throughput sequencing results. A. niger , A. flavus , P. limosum , and P. chrysogenum were the dominant species. In medicinal herbs, two distinct fungi classes were noted: field fungi (e.g., Fusarium and Alternaria ) and storage fungi (e.g., Aspergillus and Penicillium ; Sudharsan et al., 2017 ). The predominant mycoflora isolated in the present study was composed of storage fungi. Potential toxigenic fungi, such as A. niger , A. flavus , and Penicillium spp . , were the predominant molds isolated in some herbal medicines, and 31% of the strains were toxigenic ( Ahmad et al., 2014 ). In addition, A. flavus was positive for AFs, and A. ochraceus and A. niger were positive for OTA. AFs were produced by Aspergillus , particularly A. flavus and A. parasiticus (Bennett et al., 2003). OTA is mainly produced by P. nordicum , P. verrucosum , P. chrysogenum , A. niger , and A. ochraceus under diverse environmental conditions ( Ashiq et al., 2014 ). FBs are mainly produced by various species of Fusarium , including F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides (Karbancioglu-Güler et al., 2009). Although a large of Fusarium stains are FB producers, none of the Fusarium stains in our study produced FBs. This result needs to be examined further.",
          "Given that herbal medicines are easily contaminated by mycobiota before harvest and storage, the high safety of herbal medicines needs to be ensured because of their importance. The multiplex real-time PCR results showed that A. flavus and A. ochraceus harbored AF and OTA biosynthesis genes ( aflR and aoksl ); hence, the probability of the production of a particular toxin may be predicted according to the presence or absence of a gene-amplification product ( Ayanbimpe et al., 2009 ). The results of the established multiplex real-time PCR showed that 110 (67.07%) and 61 (37.20%) herbal medicines were contaminated by AF- and OTA-producing strains, respectively. The results were validated, and an excellent correlation was found between gene copies and mycotoxin content (R 2 = 0.99). The established multiplex real-time PCR analysis facilitated the rapid screening of herbal medicines with fungal contamination."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Herbal medicines are widely used to treat various ailments worldwide ( Ahmad et al., 2014 ). In China, herbal medicines were used in 91.50% of the COVID-19 cases and alleviated the symptoms and reduced the mortality and recurrence rates ( Luo et al., 2020 ). About 80% of the world's population relies on herbal medicines for primary healthcare, and the global herbal medicine market reached approximately 107 billion dollars in 2017 ( Luo et al., 2021 ). Some herbs, such as Panax notoginseng and Panax ginseng , have become important dietary supplements ( Wei et al., 2018 ; Mancuso et al., 2017). E xcessive levels of extrinsic hazardous materials (including mycotoxins, pesticides, heavy metals, and sulfur dioxide) were detected in herbal medicines ( Liu et al., 2018 ). These materials exert adverse effects on human health and have caused a global health concern ( Chen et al., 2020 ; Do et al., 2015 ). Mycotoxins trigger various ailments affecting the kidney, skin, liver, and nervous system ( Do et al., 2015 ). Currently, more than 400 different mycotoxins have been identified (Zinedine et al., 2009). In humans and animals, the most harmful mycotoxins are aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxins (OTs), and fumonisins (FBs; Binder et al., 2007 ). AFs are the most toxic mycotoxins for humans and animals, particularly aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), which is the most frequently detected metabolite and has been classified as a group IA carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC; Sardiñas et al., 2011 ). FBs can cause liver and kidney toxicity, carcinogenicity, immunosuppression, and neurotoxicity ( Bittencourt et al., 2005 ). Ochratoxin A (OTA) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) have been classified as group IIB carcinogens by the IARC ( Chen et al., 2015 ; IARC, 1993 ). Reports about mycotoxin contamination in medicinal herbs and related products indicated that AFs, OTs, and FBs are the most common contaminants ( Zhang et al., 2018 ). The natural occurrence of mycotoxins in herbal medicines and their products has been reported in various countries ( Ashiq et al., 2014 ). For example, in Chinese herbal medicines, the mean levels (incidence) of AFB1, aflatoxin B2 (AFB2), aflatoxin G1 (AFG1), and aflatoxin G2 (AFG2) were 1.40, 1.27, 0.50, and 0.94 μg/kg, respectively ( Han et al., 2010a ). In 700 herbal medicine samples from South Korea, 58 (8.29%) were confirmed AFB1 positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and 17 (2.43%) were finally confirmed as positive for total AFs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( Shim et al., 2012 ). High levels of AFB1 (52.0 μg/kg) and OTA (92.3 μg/kg) were detected in platycladi and tangerine seeds, respectively ( Chen et al., 2015 ). Thus, the severity of mycotoxin contamination in herbal medicines cannot be underestimated, and for drug safety and consumer interests, mycotoxin content must be examined before herbs are marketed. Moreover, toxigenic fungi infecting herbal medicines and producing mycotoxins as natural contaminants affect the quality and safety of herbal medicines. The mismanagement of herbal medicines during growth, processing, storage, and transportation leads to severe spoilage, along with toxigenic fungal and mycotoxin contamination ( Chen et al., 2020 ). Different taxa of fungi are detected in medicinal plants, and Aspergillus and Penicillium are the most predominant genera ( Moorthy et al., 2010 ). However, few studies have discussed the diversity and composition of fungal communities on the surfaces of herbal medicines. High-throughput sequencing can provide the mass data of microbial communities in low abundance levels and has been applied to soil and fermented products ( Dong et al., 2016 ; Ezekiel et al., 2019 ), providing a way to explore the diversity and composition of fungal communities in herbal medicines. Several Aspergillus , Fusarium , Alternaria , and Penicillium strains are mycotoxin producers that produce AFs, FBs, and OTs ( Zheng et al., 2014 ; Geisen et al., 2004 ). Mycotoxins are fungal secondary metabolites, but the occurrence of fungal communities in herbal medicines and their interactions with mycotoxins have not been systematically studied. Therefore, the isolation and verification of mycotoxin-producing fungi can facilitate the identification of potential mycotoxin sources in herbal medicines. Biosynthetic genes involved in secondary metabolites are often clustered in fungi and facilitate the coordination of transcriptional activation and regulation (Shwab et al., 2008). An increasing number of studies have focused on elucidating the pathways of mycotoxin biosynthesis, and the complete gene clusters involved in mycotoxin biosynthesis have been identified ( Gil-Serna et al., 2020 ). For example, omtA , ordA , ver-1 , and aflR are the key genes involved in AF biosynthesis; otanps and aoksl are the key genes involved in OTA biosynthesis; and fum1 , fum2 , fum3 , fum4 , fum6 , fum8 , fum13 , and tri5 are the key genes involved in FB biosynthesis ( Han et al., 2012 ). Developments in research into the mycotoxin biosynthesis pathway increases have facilitated the design of the specific probes of the key genes. Multiple real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to detect key genes at the molecular level and has provided evidence of contamination of toxic fungi ( Rahman et al., 2020 ). Therefore, a multiple real-time fluorescent PCR method for the key genes of mycotoxin biosynthesis can be established for the rapid identification of mycotoxin-producing fungi in herbal medicines. Hence, the objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to determine the occurrence of mycotoxins and fungal communities in herbal medicines by using ELISA and high-throughput sequencing; (2) to predict toxigenic fungi that mainly produce mycotoxins on the basis of Spearman's correlation analysis; (3) to confirm the potential mycotoxin-producing capacities of culturable strains by traditional culture methods; and (4) to establish a method for rapidly identifying mycotoxin-producing fungi by multiple real-time fluorescent PCR. This work will provide a scientific basis for the formulation of a standard for mycotoxin level and for the early risk warning of mycotoxin contamination in herbal medicines. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials Mycotoxin contamination mainly occurs during the harvesting, processing, transportation, and storage of herbal medicines. Therefore, a comprehensive survey was conducted in large-scale areas covering major herbal medicine markets in China, and few samples were obtained from Southeast Asia. A total of 240 samples of 80 kinds of most commonly used herbal medicines were selected according to their medicinal parts: radix and rhizoma (36 kinds), flos (5 kinds), fructus and semen (20 kinds), folium and cortex (11 kinds), and herba and others (8 kinds), as shown in Supplemental File: Dataset S1. Each sample was divided into three subsamples. One subsample was analyzed for the occurrence of mycotoxins, one was used to analyze the diversity and composition of microbial communities, and one was used for the isolation and identification of toxic fungi. These samples were processed as soon as possible to prevent second contamination. 2.2 Mycotoxin content analysis Herein, 240 herbal medicine subsamples were ground, homogenized, sieved, and stored in polyethylene bags and used for mycotoxin detection. AF content was detected using an ELISA test kit for AFs (RNM98001, 96T, REAGEN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Hu et al., 2018 ). 5 g of sample was accurately weighed and placed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, 25 mL of methanol solution was added, and sonication was performed for 3 min at room temperature. Moreover, 1 mL of liquid was placed in a 2 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 rpm. Subsequently, 100 μL of supernatant was diluted with 500 μL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution to prepare the sample solution. For OT content analysis, medicinal samples were prepared and extracted using an ELISA test kit for OTs (RNM98008, 96T, REAGEN, USA; Sun et al., 2019 ). Briefly, 1 g of medicinal samples was weighed and mixed with 2 mL of 50% methanol–PBS solution. After vigorous shaking for 10 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted 1:5 with PBS prior to test with ELISA test kit. FB extraction and tests were performed with an FB ELISA test kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNM98009, 96T, REAGEN, USA; Ghali et al., 2009 ). 5 g of sample was extracted with 25 mL of 70% methanol. The extract was filtered, and 1 mL of filtered sample was then diluted with 13 mL of distilled water. 50 μL of diluted filtrate per well was used for the ELISA test. Afterward, the absorbance value was determined with a microplate reader at 450 nm, and AF, OT, and FB content were calculated. Linear regression analysis was performed with a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.991, 0.993, and 0.998 for AFs, FBs, and OTs, respectively (Supplemental File: Table S1 ). The recovery rates for AFs, FBs, and OTs are quite efficient, ranging from 85.32% ± 2.32%–87.91% ± 4.85%. Furthermore, positive samples (medicinal herbs for which mycotoxins tested by the above ELISA kits) were confirmed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QQQ-MS) to prevent false positives. Sample separation was performed on a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column (100 mm × 3 mm, 1.8 μm, Agilent). The conditions for AFs and OTA were as follows: the column temperature was 30 °C, the flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, and the injection volume was 1 μL ( Yang et al., 2016 ). The mobile phase was composed of (A) water containing 0.1% HCOOH and (B) methanol containing 0.1% HCOOH. The gradient elution program was set as follows: 0–3.5 min, 45% B; 3.5–4.5 min, 45%–75% B; 4.5–10 min, 75% B. The mass spectrometer was optimized in the multiple reaction monitoring mode, and the positive electrospray ion [ESI + ] polarity was employed. Then, high-purity nitrogen was used as the drying and ionization gas. The capillary voltage, source temperature, and desolvation temperature were 2.50 kV, 150 °C, and 350 °C, respectively. The conditions for FBs were set as follows: the column temperature was 35 °C, flow rate was 0.3 mL/min, and injection volume was 1 μL ( Qian et al., 2012 ). The mobile phase was composed of (A) water containing 0.1% HCOOH and (B) methanol-acetonitrile (v/v, 50/50). The gradient elution program was set as follows: 0–2.3 min, 30%–70% B; 2.3–4.0 min, 70% B; 4–4.2 min, 70%–100% B. The capillary voltage, source temperature, and desolvation temperature were 3.50 kV, 120 °C, and 350 °C, respectively. The parameters on the m/z and collision energy of parent ions, primary daughter ions, secondary daughter ions, standard curve, linearity ( R 2 ), and recovery for the analysis of AFs, OTA, and FBs are shown in Supplemental File: Table S2 . Linear regression analysis was performed with correlation coefficient (R 2 ) ranging from 0.9995 to 0.9999. The recovery rates for mycotoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, FB1, FB2, and OTA) ranged from 95.84% ± 2.09%–100.80% ± 1.86%. 2.3 Culture-independent ITS rRNA sequencing analysis 10 g of each herbal medicine subsample was transferred to a 250 mL sterilized conical flask. Then, 190 mL of sterile water and 20 glass beads were added. The flasks were shaken for 20 min at 130 rpm. Total DNA was extracted from the sediments after centrifugation with PowerWater DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Al-gabr et al., 2014 ). Moreover, ITS rRNA gene fragments were amplified using the fungal primers ITS1F/ITS2R ( Adams et al., 2013 ). The amplification program was set as follows: pre-denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 52 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were purified using an agarose gel DNA extraction kit, quantified with Qubit 3.0 (Life Invitrogen, Germany), and placed on an Illumina PE 250 platform (Shanghai Biozeron Co., Ltd., China) for paired-end (2 × 250 bp) sequencing ( Dong et al., 2018a ; Dong et al., 2018b ). The fastq files were input into the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the accession number was PRJNA722322. Raw sequence reads were de-multiplexed and quality filtered with QIIME (v 1.9.0; Caporaso et al., 2010b ). High-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a 97% similarity cutoff obtained by UPARSE software (v 10; Edgar et al., 2011 ). Moreover, the phylogenetic affiliation of ITS rRNA representative sequence was performed using the Ribosomal Database Project classifier (v 2.2) against the Unite (v 8.2) databases (Release 132; Kõljalg et al., 2013 ). For fungal microbiome comparisons, samples were grouped according to medicinal type (radix and rhizoma group, flos group, fructus and semen group, folium and cortex group, and herba and others group) and mycotoxin content (mycotoxin-free group, mycotoxin-contaminated group, and mycotoxin-excessive group). Herein, alpha diversity indices (i.e., Chao 1 and Shannon) were calculated by mothur (v.1.30.1), and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination (NMDS) analysis based on unweighted distance metrics was performed to determine taxonomic dissimilarity among groups ( Schloss et al., 2009 ; Caporaso et al., 2010a ). One-way ANOVA was performed to measure significant difference in fungal diversity among groups. Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was conducted to test significant differences among groups ( Oksanen et al., 2007 ). A Venn diagram was used in identifying unique and shared OTUs in different groups with R (v2.15.1, Wei et al., 2021 ). Circos plots showing the distribution proportion of core fungal microbiota were visualized using Circos table viewer1 ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 ). The correlation between fungal community abundance and mycotoxin content was calculated through Spearman rank correlation test using corr. test function in psych package (Revelle et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2009). 2.4 Isolation of culturable fungi and their ability of producing mycotoxins 10 g of each herbal medicine subsample was mixed with 30 mL of Tween 20 (0.1%, v/v) and vortexed for 3 min; then, the mixture was filtrated and centrifuged at 3000 rpm/min for 10 min ( Zheng et al., 2017 ). The solution (100 μL) was transferred to a potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (containing 200 g of potato, 20 g of glucose, 15 g of agar, and 0.1 g of chloramphenicol in 1 L of water) and cultured at 25 °C for 7 days. The obtained fungal colonies were then transferred to a fresh PDA medium and ascertained for purity. The purified isolates were microscopically identified according to the manual of fungal identification, and the total DNA of purified fungal isolates was extracted using Fungal DNA Mini Kit (OMEGA, USA; Zheng et al., 2017 ). Then, PCR amplification was performed, and the PCR products were sequenced. The obtained sequences were analyzed with the BLAST program ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) in the NCBI for the identification of the genera and species of the fungal isolates (similarity ≥98%; Wu et al., 2013 ). A neighbor-joining tree was performed based on multiple sequence alignment using MEGA 5.0 with bootstrap replications ( Tamura et al., 2011 ). Therefore, all the isolates obtained were cultured in a PDA liquid medium at 25 °C (180 rpm) for 7 days to measure the potential mycotoxin-producing capacities of the strains. Then, 10 mL of culture broth was extracted with 10 mL of ethylacetate and then with 10 mL of dichloromethane, and the two organic layers were combined, evaporated, and dried ( Zheng et al., 2017 ). The residues were diluted with 1.0 mL ethanol and passed through a 0.22 μm filter, and the filtrate was injected into UPLC-QQQ-MS for the determination of AFs, OTA, and FBs according to the procedures in Materials and methods 2.2. 2.5 Rapid molecular detection of toxin-producing fungi through multiple real-time fluorescent PCR Herein, the primers of AF biosynthesis-related genes ( aflR , omt-1 , nor-1 , and ver-1 ) and OTA biosynthesis-related genes ( aoksl ) were used for the specific detection of potentially toxigenic fungi (Supplemental File: Table S3 ; CPC, 2020 ; Priyanka et al., 2014 ; Tassaneeyakul et al., 2004 ). The standard fungus strains Aspergillus flavus (ATCC 336156) and Aspergillus ochraceus (ATCC 336184) were used as positive control strains. DNA was extracted from the above positive control strains and traditional herbal medicines. Then, PCR was carried out in 20 μL with 10 μmol/L forward primer, 10 μmol/L reverse primer (0.5 μL), 2 μL of 10 × PCR buffer, 0.5 μL of 10 mmol/L of dNTP, 2 μL of 25 mmol/L of MgCl 2 , 2 μL of template DNA, and 0.5 μL of 5 U/μL Taq Plus DNA polymerase. Subsequently, PCR was performed with the following procedures: 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s in each cycle ( Chen et al., 2020 ). The DNA was denatured initially for 3 min at 95 °C and then at 72 °C for 8 min. Four amplified target sequences were cloned into vector pMD 18-T, and plasmid DNA was extracted using SanPrep Column Plaxmid Mini-Preps (B518191, SanPrep, Sangon Biotech). The constructed plasmid was identified and used for the subsequent multiple real-time fluorescent PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR reaction system (10 μL) was composed of 0.2 μL of 10 μmol/L forward primer, 10 μmol/L reverse primer, 0.2 μL of 10 μmol/L probes, 2 μL of 10 × PCR buffer, 1 μL of template DNA, and 5 μL of 2X TaqMan Fast qPCR Master Mix. Furthermore, PCR was performed under initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of melting at 94 °C for 5 s, and annealing at 60 °C for 30 s. Herein, fluorescence signals were monitored during the annealing phase of each PCR cycle, and Ct values were obtained using a fluorescent quantitative PCR instrument (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). A total of 164 herbal medicines were prone to mycotoxin contamination (Supplemental File: Dataset S2) were investigated using this method to detect the contamination rates of AF- and OTA-producing fungi ( CPC, 2020 ). The result was validated by liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry according to the method described in Materials and methods 2.2. 3 Results 3.1 Mycotoxin content in herbal medicines In 240 herbal medicine samples, 151 (62.92% of occurrence) were detected positive for AFs with content of up to 156.76 μg/kg in Cinnamomi Cortex (with an average of 11.60 μg/kg), as shown in Fig. 1 A and Supplemental File: Dataset S3. Herein, 87 (36.25%) samples were detected positive for OTs (1.02–34.96 μg/kg, with an average of 3.04 μg/kg), and the highest level was found in Mori Folium (34.96 μg/kg), followed by the levels in Amomi Fructus (28.40 μg/kg) and Corni Fructus (24.93 μg/kg). FB contamination was found in 154 (64.17%) herbal medicine samples, and the average FB level was 274.54 μg/kg. Rhei Radix et Rhizoma had an extremely high concentration of FBs (6051.52 μg/kg). Moreover, 10 μg/kg AFs, 20 μg/kg OTs, and 1000 μg/kg FBs were proposed as the reasonable maximum residue levels in herbal medicines, and 58 (24.17%), 8 (3.33%), and 15 (6.25%) samples exceeded these limits, respectively ( Fig. 1 B and Supplemental file: Dataset S3). AF content was detected in different medicinal types, ranging from 1.14 μg/kg to 139.41 μg/kg in 60.00% of flos samples, from 1.21 μg/kg to 156.76 μg/kg in 81.82% of folium and cortex samples, from 1.06 μg/kg to 113.15 μg/kg in 65.00% of fructus and semen samples, from 1.11 μg/kg to 21.02 μg/kg in 75.00% of herba and others samples, and from 1.05 μg/kg to 129.78 μg/kg in 53.70% of radix and rhizoma samples ( Fig. 1 C and Supplemental File: Dataset S3). The average contamination levels of AFs in flos, folium and cortex, fructus and semen, herba and others, and radix and rhizoma samples were 28.22, 20.20, 18.15, 5.85, and 20.20 μg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the over-limit ratios of AFs were 40%, 30.30%, 30%, 2.50%, and 19.44%, respectively ( Fig. 1 D and Supplemental File: Dataset S3). For OTs, 46.67% of flos, 57.58% of folium and cortex, 26.67% of fructus and semen, 41.67% of herba and others, and 7.94% of radix and rhizoma were contaminated with OTs and had OT levels of 1.24–18.40, 1.21–34.96, 1.11–28.40, 6.56–11.76, and 6.56–11.76 μg/kg, respectively ( Fig. 1 E and Supplemental File: Dataset S3). Herein, the mean levels of OTs in flos, folium and cortex, fructus and semen, herba and others, and radix and rhizoma samples were 6.64, 10.38, 10.01, 4.81, and 7.94 μg/kg, respectively. The highest over-limit ratio of OTs was 9.09% in the folium and cortex samples, followed by the over-limit ratios in fructus and semen (5.00%) and radix and rhizoma (1.85%), as shown in Fig. 1 F and Supplemental File: Dataset S3. The FB content ranges were 1.87–2709.06, 1.22–4844.62, 1.15–5782.61, 1.07–853.20, and 1.40–6051.52 μg/kg in 46.67% of flos, 54.55% of folium and cortex, 65.00% of fructus and semen, 54.17% of herba and others, and 68.52% of radix and rhizoma, respectively ( Fig. 1 G and Supplemental File: Dataset S3). The average levels of FBs were 293.60 μg/kg (flos), 818.20 μg/kg (folium and cortex), 375.69 μg/kg (fructus and semen), 188.39 μg/kg (herba and others), and 420.61 μg/kg (radix and rhizome). The highest over-limit ratio of FBs was 12.12% (folium and cortex), followed the over-limit ratios in flos (6.67%), fructus and semen (6.67%), and radix and rhizoma (5.56%), as shown in Fig. 1 H and Supplemental File: Dataset S3. 3.2 Diversity and composition of fungal communities in herbal medicines A total of 14,800,926 high-quality reads were identified from 240 herbal medicine samples, ranging from 46,397 reads to 73,473 reads (Supplemental File: Dataset S4). Chao 1 varied among the herbal medicines, ranging from 243 to 2663 (Supplemental File: Fig. S1A ). The range of the Shannon index was 0.69–4.75 (Supplemental File: Fig. S1B ). Ascomycota (80.20% of sequences) and Basidiomycota (8.02%) were the most abundant phyla (Supplemental File: Dataset S5). The most predominant genus was Aspergillus (43.77%), followed by Fusarium (5.17%), Cladosporium (4.46%), Alternaria (3.69%), Penicillium (2.85%), and Xeromyces (2.46%), as shown in Supplemental File: Dataset S6. The diversity and composition of the fungal communities in different medicinal types were different. In general, the Chao 1 and Shannon indices in the flos group were higher than those of the radix and rhizoma, fructus and semen, folium and cortex, and herba and others ( Fig. 2 A–B). The number of common and unique OTUs in the five groups is shown in the Venn diagram ( Fig. 2 C). Overall, 1,497, 206, 551, 433, and 156 OTUs were obtained from radix and rhizoma, flos, fructus and semen, folium and cortex, and herba and others, respectively. NMDS analyses based on unweighted dissimilarities showed that different medicinal types markedly affected the composition of fungal communities (R = 0.12, P = 0.002, ANOSIM test analysis; Fig. 2 D). Herein, fungal communities in different medicinal types were analyzed at the phylum and genus levels ( Fig. 2 E–F and Supplemental File: Figs. S2–S3 and Tables S4–S5 ). At the phylum level, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota displayed significant compartment specificity ( P < 0.05). The average relative abundances of Ascomycota in herba and others and fructus and semen groups were significantly higher than those in the other groups. By contrast, the average relative abundances of Basidiomycota in the flos and radix and rhizoma groups were significantly higher than those in the other groups. At the genus level, the average relative abundances of Aspergillus in folium and cortex and herba and others groups were significantly higher than those in the other groups. The average relative abundances of Cladosporium , Fusarium , and Alternaria were significantly enriched in the flos groups, compared with those in the other groups. The average relative abundances of Penicillium and Xeromyces were significantly enriched in the fructus and semen and radix and rhizoma groups, compared with those in the other groups. After the mycotoxin content in each herbal medicine sample was determined, the diversity and composition of fungal communities in mycotoxin-free, -contaminated, and -excessive groups were compared. In general, the Chao 1 and Shannon indices in the mycotoxin-free group were higher than those of mycotoxin-excessive and -contaminated groups ( Fig. 3 A–B). Venn profiles revealed 4068 OTUs shared by three groups, and the mycotoxin-free, -contaminated, and -excessive groups had 354, 1919, and 594 unique OTUs, respectively ( Fig. 3 C). NMDS analyses based on unweighted dissimilarities found that mycotoxin content significantly affected the composition of the fungal communities (R = 0.24, P = 0.007, ANOSIM test analysis; Fig. 3 D). At the phylum level, the average relative abundances of Ascomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Mucoromycota, and Olpidiomycota in the mycotoxin-excessive group were significantly higher than those in the mycotoxin-contaminated and -free groups ( Fig. 3 E and Supplemental File: Table S6 ). In addition, the average relative abundances of Basidiomycota and Chytridiomycota in the mycotoxin-contaminated group were significantly higher than those in the mycotoxin-excessive and -free groups. At the genus level, the average relative abundances of Aspergillus , Fusarium , Penicillium , and Xeromyces in the mycotoxin-excessive group were significantly higher than those in mycotoxin-contaminated and -free groups ( Fig. 3 F and Supplemental File: Table S7 ). The average relative abundances of Cladosporium , Alternaria , Plectosphaerella , and Vishniacozyma in the mycotoxin-contaminated group were significantly higher than those in the mycotoxin-excessive and -free groups. 3.3 Spearman's correlation analysis of fungal abundance and mycotoxin content The correlations of fungal abundance and mycotoxin content were calculated using Spearman's correlation, and the results showed that the abundances of 10, 5, and 11 fungi were significantly correlated with AF, OT, and FB content, respectively ( P < 0.05; Fig. 4 and Supplemental File: Dataset S7). In particular, AF content was significantly and positively correlated with the abundances of Alternaria , Aspergillus , Aureobasidium , Debaryomyces , Fusarium , Monilia , Phoma , Strigula , and Filobasidium (R > 0.5, P < 0.05). In addition, OT content was significantly and positively correlated with the abundances of Alternaria , Aureobasidium , Didymella , and Penicillium (R > 0.5, P < 0.05). Moreover, FB content was significantly and positively correlated with the abundances of Alternaria , Cyberlindnera , Fusarium , Paraconiothyrium , Penicillium , Phoma , Wickerhamomyces , Naganishia , Rhodosporidiobolus , and Rhodotorula (R > 0.6, P < 0.05). 3.4 Isolation and identification of fungi producing mycotoxins in herbal medicines A total of 323 isolates were isolated from herbal medicines, and 20 fungal strains were obtained after identification ( Table 1 and Supplemental File: Dataset S8). The most predominant genus was Aspergillus (283, 87.62%), followed by Penicillium (9, 2.79%), Didymella (8, 2.48%), Aureobasidium (6, 1.86%), and Mucor (4, 1.24%). In the 283 Aspergillus species recovered, A. niger (71.21%) was the dominant species, followed by A. flavus (10.84%), A. costaricensis (3.72%), A. terreus (0.93%), A. urmiensis (0.31%), A. nidulans (0.31%), and A. versicolor (0.31%). However, the Penicillium genus had two species, P. limosum (1.24%) and P. chrysogenum (0.93%). The morphology and microstructures of the partial primary strains are shown in Supplemental File: Fig. S4 . The Aspergillus and Penicillium were the predominant genera in our culturable fungi, similar to our sequencing results. The analysis of potential mycotoxin-producing fungi showed that mycotoxins were detected in three strains ( A. flavus , A. niger , and A. ochraceus ; Fig. 5 ). For A. niger , the colony grew rapidly and was initially white before turning black and plush; the conidium head was brown-black and radiating, the meristem varied in length, the apical capsule was spherical, the pedicel was double, and the conidia were brown and spherical ( Fig. 5 A). The A. flavus colony grew rapidly and had a loose structure and pale-yellow surface. The mycelium was composed of various complex branching hyphae, and the vegetative hyphae were separated. In addition, the mycelium formed long and rough conidia and had flask-shaped or nearly spherical apical sacs at the top, and various pedicels with spherical conidia with rough surfaces were observed ( Fig. 5 B). The A. ochraceus colony grew rapidly and was flat, and velvety. The conidium head was brown and black, the apical capsule was spherical and lagger, and the conidia were spherical ( Fig. 5 C). After being cultured at 25 °C (180 rpm) for 7 days, AFB1 (206.75 μg/mL), AFB2 (3.31 μg/mL), and AFG2 (4.34 μg/mL) were simultaneously detected in one strain of A. flavus ; hence, OTA was detected in the strains of A. ochraceus (228.27 μg/mL) and A. niger (500.24 μg/mL), as shown in Fig. 5 D and E. 3.5 Establishment and application of rapid detection method for toxigenic fungi in herbal medicines Multiple real-time fluorescent PCR was established to facilitate the simultaneous detection of mycotoxin-producing fungi isolated from herbal medicines. Primers specific for regulatory genes involved in AFs ( aflR , omt-1 , nor1 , and ver-1 ) and OTA ( aoksl ) biosynthesis were assayed in Aspergillus ( Fig. 6 A). The amplification products of aflR and aoksl were obtained from A. flavus , A. ochraceus , and A. niger and displayed positive signals when corresponding gene primers were used. These positive signals indicated the potential uses of these products in AF and OTA production. Hence, the specificity of the developed multiple real-time fluorescent PCR was conﬁrmed; it showed good performance in discriminating among the tested species and between mycotoxin-producing and nonproducing strains. The established multiple real-time fluorescent PCR was applied to detect the mycobiota of herbal medicines, and 164 samples were tested for the presence of genes involved in the biosynthesis of mycotoxins ( Fig. 6 B–F and Supplemental File: Dataset S9). A total of 110 (67.07%) herbal medicines were positive for aflR signals with concentrations from 5.92 copies to 2900 copies, indicating the presence of aflatoxigenic strains ( Fig. 6 B–C). AF content was tested at 0.03–27.30 μg/kg ( Fig. 6 D). A high relevance (R 2 = 0.9988) was observed between the aflR gene copies and AF content ( Fig. 6 E). In addition, the aoksl gene was detected in 61 herbal medicines from 15.7 copies up to 288 copies, indicating that 37.20% of herbal medicine samples were positive for OTA-producing strains ( Fig. 6 B–C). OTA content was tested at 0.02–2.76 μg/kg ( Fig. 6 D), and an excellent correlation (R 2 = 0.9982) was obtained between the gene aoksl copies and OTA content ( Fig. 6 F). 4 Discussion A total of 240 herbal medicine samples were analyzed for mycotoxins contamination. Approximately 62.92%, 36.25%, and 64.17% of the samples were contaminated with AFs, OTs, and FBs, respectively. A previous study showed that 50 out of 60 (83.3% of incidence) herbal medicines were contaminated with mycotoxins at concentrations ranging from 1.7 μg/kg to 48.0 μg/kg ( Han et al., 2012 ). AFs are potent mutagens and carcinogens, and 15.5% of traditional Chinese medicine samples were positive for AFs with concentrations of up to 290.8 μg/kg; 5.71% of the positive samples exceeded the proposed limits ( Liu et al., 2012 ). OTA exerts nephrotoxic, teratogenic, neurotoxic, and hepatotoxic effects (Petzinger et al., 2000). Eight (26.7%) samples were contaminated with OTA at concentrations ranging from 9.85 μg/kg to 125 μg/kg ( Ahmad et al., 2014 ). FB contamination in medicinal plants has been reported, and 75% of samples were found contaminated with FB1 with an average concentration of 0.315 μg/kg (Karbancioglu-Güler et al., 2009). More than 50% of traditional Chinese medicine samples were contaminated with FBs (0.58–88.95 μg/kg); 94.4%, 77.8%, and 33.3% of the samples were contaminated with FB1, FB2, and FB3, respectively ( Han et al., 2010b ). The maximum limits of 10 μg/kg for total AFs in some herbal medicines have been set by the Chinese Pharmacopeia, OTs are regulated at 20 μg/kg in the European Pharmacopeia, and FBs are regulated at 1000 μg/kg in the European Union Commission Regulation ( CPC, 2020 ; EP, 20 11; EC, 2007). In our paper, 24.17%, 3.33%, and 6.25% of samples exceeded content of AFs (10 μg/kg), OTs (20 μg/kg), and FBs (1000 μg/kg). A previous study showed that 10 samples (5.71%) exceeded the AF content (10 μg/kg) in 174 herbal medicine samples ( Romagnoli et al., 2007 ). Some medicinal plants and related products sold commercially may be contaminated with high levels of mycotoxins because of the lack of official legislation. To guarantee drug safety and consumer interests, official legislation on the maximum limits of common mycotoxins in herbal medicines should be formulated and implemented. Seeds had a higher level of FB contamination (90%) than rhizomes and roots, grasses and leaves, and flowers in the herbal medicine samples ( Siddique et al., 2013 ). Our results showed that the over-limit ratios of mycotoxins were higher in the radix and rhizoma, fructus and semen, and folium and cortex than the over-limit ratio in herba and others. Herbal medicines are rich in starch and oil, which might promote mycotoxin production ( Ying et al., 2016 ). In particular, the contamination levels of some samples (i.e., Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Polygini Multiflori Radix, Angelicae Dahuricae Radix, Corni Fructus, and Amomi Fructus) were notable, as they had high sugar, fat, or starch content (Zain et al., 2011). The different mycotoxin levels in herbal medicines results from fungal growth rates, which were affected by some factors, such as storage temperature and moisture level ( Liu et al., 2012 ). In other words, herbal medicines are easily contaminated by all kinds of molds that produce various mycotoxins, and the process is complicated by intrinsic (i.e., chemical composition) and extrinsic environmental (i.e., temperature and moisture) factors. Contamination not only affects the quality of herbal medicines and resulting in enormous financial loss but also influences the safety and effectiveness of herbal medicines, posing potential threats to human health. Therefore, herbs should be dried as soon as possible after harvesting, and appropriate measures, such as the “antagonistic storage” method based on the “couplet medicine” technique should be performed during the storage of herbal medicines ( Ying et al., 2016 ). The “couplet medicine” technique is based on the principle of “protecting herbal medicines with other herbal medicines.” Two kinds of herbal medicines are stored together and prevent mildew while competing with each other, exhibiting no obvious changes in color, smell, and quality. As a green, safe, and economic strategy for preserving herbal medicines, the “antagonistic storage” method is based on the above mode and principle of “couplet medicine” technique to protect herbal medicines from being moldy. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi, such as Aspergillus , Penicillium , Fusarium , and Alternaria (Zain et al., 2011). Approximately 92% of medicinal herbs and spices collected from India are contaminated by fungi, and 47% exceeded the permissible limits of the WHO (Aiko et al., 2016). High-throughput sequencing is a potential approach for investigating the fungal contamination in herbal medicines and ensuring drug efficacy ( Luo et al., 2019 ). We applied high-throughput sequencing to study fungal contamination in 240 herbal medicines. Our sequencing results showed that the richness and diversity of fungal communities varied among the herbal medicines. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most predominant phyla, consistent to a previous study ( Jiang et al., 2020 ). The most predominant genus was Aspergillus , followed by Fusarium , Cladosporium , Alternaria , Penicillium , and Xeromyces in our herbal medicines; a similar phenomenon was shown in previous studies ( Yu et al., 2020 ). In Ziziphi Spinosae Semen samples, Ascomycota, Aspergillus , Candida , and Wallemia were the dominant fungi ( Guo et al., 2018 ). In the Cassiae Semen samples, Ascomycota, Aspergillus , Cladosporium , and Penicillium were the prevailing fungi . These studies showed that Ascomycota, Aspergillus , and Penicillium were the most common contaminants and potentially produce mycotoxins. Meanwhile, difference in fungal community among the five groups with different medicinal types was found. Especially, the abundances of P en icillium and Xeromyces were significantly enriched in fructus and semen and radix and rhizoma groups, which had high sugar, fat, or starch content. The chemical composition of herbal medicines might be the main factor influencing the fungal microbiota. Furthermore, difference in fungal community among the three groups (mycotoxin-free, -contaminated, and -excessive groups) was observed. The Chao1 and Shannon indices of the fungal microbiome in the mycotoxin-free group were higher than those of the mycotoxin-excessive and -contaminated groups. This result was consistent with the findings of other studies and indicated that fungal microbiome diversity was reduced in the presence of mycotoxin contamination ( Ding et al., 2015 ; Yuan et al., 2018 ). In a previous study, difference in fungal diversity between aflatoxin-contaminated and -free Platycladi Semen samples was observed, and mycotoxin-producing fungi associated with mycotoxin content was found in Platycladi Semen ( Yu et al., 2020 ). Spearman's correlation results showed that fungal abundance (e.g., Aspergillus Fusarium , and Penicillium ) was significantly correlated with the content of mycotoxins (e.g., AFs, OTA, and FBs). Notably, the presence of these potential mycotoxin-producing fungi is a necessary prerequisite for mycotoxin contamination. In addition, Aspergillus , Fusarium , Penicillium , and Alternaria spp. were the most frequently detected genera contaminating food and herbal medicines and contained the majority of mycotoxin producers ( Zheng et al., 2017 ). AFs were produced by Aspergillus (Bennett et al., 2003), OTA was mainly produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. ( Ashiq et al., 2014 ), and FBs were mainly produced by various Fusarium spp. under diverse environmental conditions (Karbancioglu-Güler et al., 2009). Fungi were isolated from the herbal medicines to verify potential mycotoxin producers. The results showed that Aspergillus and Penicillium were the most predominant genera, similar to our high-throughput sequencing results. A. niger , A. flavus , P. limosum , and P. chrysogenum were the dominant species. In medicinal herbs, two distinct fungi classes were noted: field fungi (e.g., Fusarium and Alternaria ) and storage fungi (e.g., Aspergillus and Penicillium ; Sudharsan et al., 2017 ). The predominant mycoflora isolated in the present study was composed of storage fungi. Potential toxigenic fungi, such as A. niger , A. flavus , and Penicillium spp . , were the predominant molds isolated in some herbal medicines, and 31% of the strains were toxigenic ( Ahmad et al., 2014 ). In addition, A. flavus was positive for AFs, and A. ochraceus and A. niger were positive for OTA. AFs were produced by Aspergillus , particularly A. flavus and A. parasiticus (Bennett et al., 2003). OTA is mainly produced by P. nordicum , P. verrucosum , P. chrysogenum , A. niger , and A. ochraceus under diverse environmental conditions ( Ashiq et al., 2014 ). FBs are mainly produced by various species of Fusarium , including F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides (Karbancioglu-Güler et al., 2009). Although a large of Fusarium stains are FB producers, none of the Fusarium stains in our study produced FBs. This result needs to be examined further. Given that herbal medicines are easily contaminated by mycobiota before harvest and storage, the high safety of herbal medicines needs to be ensured because of their importance. The multiplex real-time PCR results showed that A. flavus and A. ochraceus harbored AF and OTA biosynthesis genes ( aflR and aoksl ); hence, the probability of the production of a particular toxin may be predicted according to the presence or absence of a gene-amplification product ( Ayanbimpe et al., 2009 ). The results of the established multiplex real-time PCR showed that 110 (67.07%) and 61 (37.20%) herbal medicines were contaminated by AF- and OTA-producing strains, respectively. The results were validated, and an excellent correlation was found between gene copies and mycotoxin content (R 2 = 0.99). The established multiplex real-time PCR analysis facilitated the rapid screening of herbal medicines with fungal contamination. 5 Conclusions A globalized and standardized strategy for monitoring extrinsic hazardous materials, such as mycotoxins, should be developed to ensure the safety of herbal medicines and their benefits to human health. This paper provided the contamination status of fungi and mycotoxins in herbal medicines and established a rapid method for detecting toxigenic fungi. Herein, the prevalent contamination phenomenon of mycotoxins (AFs, OTs, and FBs) and potential toxigenic fungi ( Aspergillus , Fusarium , and Cladosporium ) was observed. A. flavus harbored the AF-synthesis gene aflR , and A. ochraceus and A. niger harbored the OTA-synthesis gene aoksl . With aflR and aoksl genes, multiplex real-time PCR was established for the rapid and accurate detection of AF- and OTA-producing fungi. This work established a rapid method for detecting toxigenic fungi in herbal medicines and providing early risk warning about mycotoxin contamination in herbal medicines.
