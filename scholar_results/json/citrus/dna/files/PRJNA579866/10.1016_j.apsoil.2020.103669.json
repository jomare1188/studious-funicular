    "full_text": "Biological nitrogen fixed by diazotrophs is important because it is the largest natural source of nitrogen to support primary productivity and maintain ecosystem sustainability when anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are lacking, especially in mining areas. The present study selected six different land use types (a corn field, a vegetable field, an area of shrubs, a mine tailing, a forest and a citrus orchard) as variables related to the mining activities around the Siding mining area, Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, China. A 0–10 cm soil layer was sampled, and the heavy metal concentrations and soil physicochemical properties were measured. Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology was used to analyze the abundance and structural diversity of the diazotroph community. The distribution of diazotroph assemblages among the different land use types and the main soil environmental properties that drive diazotroph community compositions were determined. The results indicated that the phylum Cyanobacteria (85.89%) was the most dominant taxon in the diazotrophic community in the citrus orchard. However, in the soils of the five other land use types, Proteobacteria was the most dominant taxon in the diazotrophic community, with a high abundance that ranged from 60.08% to 99.96%. Spearman's correlation analysis and redundancy analysis results indicated that the soil organic matter (OM) content in the citrus orchard was significantly higher than that in other areas, and the difference in soil OM content might be the main reason for the difference in the diazotrophic communities. The diazotrophic communities and their associated diversity under different land use types were driven by soil heavy metal and soil N (including NH 4 + -N, NO 3 − -N and total N (TN)) contents. Specifically, TN was highly correlated with the NMDS1 score of the soil diazotrophic community, which indicated that the soil TN content was the main reason for the high similarity among the diazotrophic communities in the corn field, vegetable field and shrub soils. Overall, our study offers a detailed description of the characteristics of the diazotroph community structure under different land use types around a mining area."

          "Landscapes dominated by human activities such as agriculture, industry and forestry can have fundamentally altered soil nutrient cycles and soil quality, and these factors consequently structure soil microbial communities ( Mganga et al., 2016 ; Wu et al., 2017 ). The soil microbial community is an important part of the soil ecosystem and participates in the cycling of specific soil materials and in biochemical reactions. Thus, the microbial community has a strong influence on soil quality and plant biomass production ( Hernández et al., 2016 ). With the development of modern molecular biology technology, high-throughput sequencing is now widely used to study microbial community composition and structural diversity ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Li et al., 2019a ). Rofner et al. (2017) analyzed the climate-related changes in soil characteristics that affected the bacterial community composition and function in high-altitude, high-latitude lakes by using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Oka and Uchida (2018) used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the impact of heavy metal stress on the structure and function of the soil bacterial community. Additionally, Wu et al. (2017) found that mercury (Hg), available phosphorus and soil moisture in electronic waste were the three major drivers affecting the composition and diversity of microbial communities by using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and clone library analyses. Thus, the influence of distinct soil environments on the diversity of soil microbial community structures has attracted widespread attention, and it has been suggested that soil microbial communities can adapt to variations in the local environment.",
          "Nitrogen is an essential element for all living organisms and is required for the biosynthesis of key cellular components, such as protein and nucleic acids ( Kuypers et al., 2018 ). Among the various nitrogen forms, biological nitrogen is rare in many environments despite being a key nutrient for plant and microbial growth and development; it controls plant productivity and microbial decomposition in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems ( Chen et al., 2019b ). Therefore, biogeochemical nitrogen cycling is particularly important. Among the nitrogen cycle processes, biological nitrogen fixation is important because it is the largest natural source of external nitrogen inputs to terrestrial ecosystems and is responsible for supporting primary productivity and maintaining ecosystem sustainability when anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are lacking ( LeBauer and Treseder, 2008 ; Chen et al., 2019b ). Biological nitrogen is fixed by nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) that fix atmospheric dinitrogen (N 2 ) via the nitrogenase protein complex. The dinitrogenase reductase ( nif H) gene is commonly used as a gene marked for the detection of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in the environment ( Kuypers et al., 2018 ). Diazotrophs are widespread in the environment and are found in diverse bacterial phyla, such as Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia ( Steenhoudt and Vanderleyden, 2000 ; Martinez-Perez et al., 2016 ; Penton et al., 2016 ; Delmont et al., 2018 ). The nitrogen fixation rate is directly associated with diazotrophic abundance and community composition, which is influenced by soil environmental changes caused by different land use types ( Hsu and Buckley, 2009 ; Tischer et al., 2015 ).",
          "Guangxi Province is known as the “hometown of nonferrous metals”; there are >6800 mines of all kinds in Guanxi Province, the highest number of any province in China ( Li et al., 2018 ). Different land use patterns around mining areas can change not only the structure and function of soil but also the biodiversity of soil microorganisms and can even cause the reconstruction of microbial communities ( Huang et al., 2018 ). Nitrogen fixation plays an important role in the reconstruction of ecosystems around mining areas. However, plant productivity is difficult to restore, and soil microbes are the main fixers in mining areas ( Hu et al., 2018 ). Broos et al. (2005) pointed out that symbiotic nitrogen fixation can be used to indicate metal toxicity in the field due to its clear ecological relevance. A previous study indicated that microbial compositions play key roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling and energy flow in mining areas ( Li et al., 2019c ). Huang et al. (2011) indicated that the abundance and activity of diazotrophs in copper mine tailings corresponded to changes in environmental conditions. Soil pH, carbon content, nutrient concentration, metal concentration, moisture, soil cover and slag depth were considered the predominant environmental factors around mining areas that largely restricted the diazotrophic population ( Che et al., 2017 ; Che et al., 2018 ; Singh and Gupta, 2018 ; Dashti et al., 2019 ; Han et al., 2019 ). Therefore, improving the diversity and community composition of diazotrophs and promoting the accumulation of nitrogen in mining areas has become a vital research focus along with a restoration challenge around mining areas.",
          "The Siding mining area is located in Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, China, with a total area of 13.64 km 2 ( Yin et al., 2008 ). Field surveys have indicated that the soil of the Siding mine area is seriously polluted by heavy metals, such as Pb, Zn and Cd ( Yin et al., 2008 ; Lu et al., 2010 ). Around the mining area, there are several land use types, and comparing the soil diazotrophic communities in different land use areas will help to better understand how diazotrophic communities are affected by complex environmental properties. Accordingly, in this study, soil samples (0–10 cm) were collected from different land use areas around the Siding mining area. The present work was undertaken with the following objectives: (a) to investigate the abundance, diversity, and community composition of diazotrophs in soils of different land use types and (b) to determine the distribution of diazotroph assemblages under different land use types in order to elucidate the main soil environmental properties that drive diazotroph community composition. Additionally, this study provides a theoretical basis for nitrogen regulation, ecological restoration and reconstruction around mining areas."

This area has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with annual rainfall and temperatures of 1650 mm and 20.6 °C, respectively. The soil around this region had been heavily contaminated by heavy metals such as lead, zinc, cadmium and copper. Sampling of the six land use types was performed around the mining area (Fig. S1), including a corn field (2 km upstream of a mining tailing), a vegetable field (3 km upstream of a mining tailing), shrubs (1 km downstream of a mining tailing), a mine tailing, forest (4 km upstream of a mining tailing) and a citrus orchard (3 km downstream of a mining tailing). The geographical coordinates and elevation relative to sea level of the six sample sites are presented in Table S1. At each site, three replicate soil samples (5 × 5 cm) with depths of 0 to 10 cm were randomly taken. A total of 18 soil samples were collected, and each sample was divided into three portions. One fresh subsample was stored at 4 °C for the analysis of soil ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 + -N) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 − -N) within seven days. The second fresh subsample was air-dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve for the analysis of soil physicochemical properties. The third fresh subsample was stored at −80 °C for DNA extraction."

The total nitrogen (TN) and soil organic matter (OM) contents were determined using the Kjeldahl method and the potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ) oxidation method, respectively ( Walkley and Black, 1934 ; Nelson and Sommers, 1982 ). Total phosphorus (TP) was determined using the Olsen method ( Olsen, 1954 ). The soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) values were determined using a pH meter (A211 Thermo Scientific, USA) and an EC meter (GLI3400, HACH, USA), respectively, in H 2 O using a 1:1 (w/v) soil:solution ratio ( Becerracastro et al., 2012 ). Soil metal (K, Ca, Na, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu) concentrations were measured using the method described by Kamran et al. (2019) . The metals were extracted with a mixture of 3:1:1 (v/v/v) concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), concentrated nitric acid (HNO 3 ) and concentrated perchloric acid (HClO 4 ), and the metal concentrations were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAnalyst 800, Perkin Elmer, USA). Nemerow's pollution index ( P N ) was used to evaluate the pollution status of the heavy metals from the six land use types around the mining area ( Zhao et al., 2019 )."

Barcodes and primers were removed after the sample sequences were sorted. Translated proteins that matched the nifH gene-encoded protein sequence and did not contain termination codons were retained. Failed and chimeric sequences were also discarded based on their alignment against the nifH gene database ( Gaby and Buckley, 2014 ; Chen et al., 2019b ). Qualified sequences were clustered into nifH operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity level using UPARSE software (version 7.0.1).

Regarding nutrients, the abundance of the diazotrophic family Bradyrhizobiaceae was positively correlated with AN ( p < 0.01). Additionally, NN was positively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic genera Anaeromyxobacter ( p < 0.001) and Geobacter ( p < 0.05) and the diazotrophic family Opitutaceae ( p < 0.01). Furthermore, TN was positively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic order Rhizobiales ( p < 0.05) but negatively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic genera Azohydromonas ( p < 0.01) and Bradyrhizobium ( p < 0.05). The abundance of the diazotrophic family Opitutaceae was also positively correlated with AP, TP and ORP ( p < 0.05). The abundance of the diazotrophic genus Microcoleus was positively correlated with soil OM and TC ( p < 0.05)."

          "The mining industry creates substantial economic benefits but causes ecological degradation in mining areas. During the process of restoring soil fertility in mining areas, the poor physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as its lack of soil OM, water, and nutrients and its high heavy metal contamination, become the main limiting factors for ecological restoration and reconstruction ( Cooke and Johnson, 2002 ; Li, 2006 ). Among them, extreme soil nitrogen deficiency is the primary type of nutrient deficiency ( Festin et al., 2019 ). Microbes are of vital importance in ecosystem maintenance and function, especially in nitrogen cycling. Nitrogen fixation carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea is fundamentally important for relieving the nitrogen limitation constraints of an ecosystem ( Jing et al., 2015 ). Heavy metal contamination in the soil around mining areas is serious, and the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and other physicochemical properties in the soil vary greatly among different land use types (Cao et al., 2018).",
          "In the present study, serious heavy metal contamination was observed in all six soils, especially in the shrub sampling area. In contrast, the concentrations of heavy metals in the vegetable field and corn field were relatively lower than those in the other areas. This may have been due to the upstream sampling location of these two areas, which would limit their exposure to runoff from the mining area. Additionally, TP, AP, TN and NN in the corn field and vegetable field and soil OM in the citrus orchard were significantly higher than those in the other areas ( Table 1 ). This may have been due to the fertilization, irrigation and cultivation of these areas ( Zhao et al., 2019 ). Proteobacteria are ubiquitous and highly diverse in terms of metabolism; they have one of the most important roles in nutrient cycling and are widespread in various environments ( Jing et al., 2015 ; Chen et al., 2019a ). One previous study indicated that Proteobacteria is considered to be the predominant microbiota in mining areas located in Northern Ontario, Canada, where the soil is contaminated by Ni and Cu ( Narendrula-Kotha and Nkongolo, 2017 ). Moreover, Proteobacteria is also considered to be the predominant microbiota in mining areas located in southwest Slovakia, where the soil contains high concentrations of Ni, cobalt (Co) and Zn ( Karelová et al., 2011 ). In the present study, Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in most of the land use types and mainly consisted of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. Among them, taxa such as Rhizobiales, Bradyrhizobiaceae, Bradyrhizobium , Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter are well known for forming root nodules with legumes and conducting symbiotic nitrogen fixation ( Oldroyd and Downie, 2008 ; Che et al., 2018 ). Therefore, the high proportions of these diazotrophs indicate the potential importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation for providing nitrogen input in this mining area. However, in the citrus orchard, nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria was the most abundant diazotroph phylum. Broadly speaking, Cyanobacteria are autotrophic; they are some of the most dominant diazotrophs in aquatic ecosystems and are widely found in the nodules of plants ( Schulz et al., 2013 ; Martinez-Perez et al., 2016 ; Lu and Lu, 2019 ). Among the Cyanobacteria, Microcoleus are known to build microbial relationships in a variety of environments, and they contain a complete nif -gene cluster ( Bolhuis et al., 2010 ; Jing et al., 2015 ). These findings might indicate that the soil diazotroph community was dominated by autotrophs in the citrus orchard. In particular, in the mine tailing, we also detected nitrogen-fixing Firmicutes that were mainly identified as Paenibacillus at the genus level. Karelová et al. (2011) indicated that Firmicutes can live in extreme environments and have the potential to repair broad-spectrum heavy metal contamination. In addition, previous studies have indicated that Paenibacillus are nitrogen-fixing bacteria ( Lopes de Sá et al., 2019 ). Paenibacillus are distributed in various habitats and have been isolated from decomposing plant materials, human-enriched soils, mining area soils and other soil samples ( Cho et al., 2019 ; Steinbock et al., 2019 ). Moreover, nitrogen-fixing Verrucomicrobia were found only in the corn field and vegetable field and were mainly identified as Opitutaceae at the family level. Previous research has indicated that Opitutaceae can be isolated from the anorectums of white ants, but their role in nitrogen fixing is not yet clear ( Kotak et al., 2015 ; Che et al., 2018 ).",
          "Exposure to a large amount of heavy metals increases the establishment of tolerant microbial communities, which leads to a reduction in microbial diversity and substantially changes the microbial community structure ( Guo et al., 2017 ). Multiple linear regression indicated that soil Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu significantly influenced the ACE index of the diazotrophic community ( Table 2 ). A high concentration of heavy metals can significantly decrease the ACE index ( Chodak et al., 2013 ). In the present study, in the shrub and citrus orchard sampling areas where heavy metal concentrations were relatively higher than those in other areas, the ACE indices were relatively low ( Fig. 1 A). However, there was no significant correlation between the soil heavy metal concentration and the diazotrophic community structure according to the Mantel test (Table S4). Therefore, soil heavy metal concentrations are found to mainly influence diazotrophic community richness but have no significant effect on diazotrophic community structure and distribution. Another previous study indicated that soil contaminated with heavy metals could adversely alter the composition of the soil diazotrophic community ( Wang et al., 2019 ). In the current study, the shrubs were located 1 km downstream of the mining area, where the heavy metal content in the soil was the highest. Compared to their abundance in the other land use types, Alphaproteobacteria were the most dominant bacteria in the shrub soil. In citrus orchards, the heavy metal content was also very high, and the P N value presented in Table S2 indicated that the pollution level in this area was second only to that in the shrub soil. However, Cyanobacteria were the most dominant bacteria in this area and were mainly identified as Microcoleus at the genus level. The main reason for this difference may be that the soil OM and TC contents and the C/N ratio were different between the two land use types. Deng et al. (2020) indicated that soil TC and OM contents and the C/N ratio strongly influenced the soil bacterial community structure in iron (Fe) mining in China. Eo and Park (2016) pointed out that soil OM was provided as root debris and exudates, and the activity of microorganisms is positively related to the soil OM content ( Graham and Haynes, 2005 ). Che et al. (2018) found that the soil OM content could be one of the main factors influencing the soil bacterial community. In our study, the results presented in Table 1 and Fig. 3 indicated that TC and OM content in citrus orchards was significantly higher than those in other sites and had a significant positive correlation with the abundance of the diazotrophic genus Microcoleus . Additionally, multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the soil OM content was more highly correlated with the ACE index of the soil diazotrophic community ( Table 2 ). Consequently, in this study, the difference in soil OM and TC content might be one of the main factors influencing the diazotrophic communities in different land use types around the Siding mining area.",
          "In addition, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are important nutrients that affect soil enzyme activities, microbial biomass and communities and various other soil properties ( Ajwa et al., 1999 ; Li et al., 2019b ). First, N-related soil properties such as TN, NN and AN levels are the most dominant factors influencing the diazotrophic community structure in soil ( Zhong et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, P and K are two common and accessible macronutrients required for plant growth, and they also influence the diazotrophic community structure and diversity in soils ( Azziz et al., 2012 ; Samaddar et al., 2019 ). Although most P in soil is not bioavailable, AP is an appropriate measure of P bioavailability for soil microbes ( Wu et al., 2017 ). In the present study, TN was one of the key factors that strongly influenced the soil diazotrophic community diversity and structure. Specifically, TN was highly correlated with the NMDS1 score of the soil diazotrophic community, and the TN content in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs was significantly higher than those in the other three areas. The dominant order in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs was Rhizobiales. Rhizobiales is a well-known diazotroph that forms root nodules with legumes that can enhance nitrogen fixation even in the presence of heavy metals ( Belimov et al., 2019 ). Hence, the effect of TN on the soil diazotrophic community was mainly reflected in the β -diversity, which indicated that the soil TN content was the main reason for the high similarity among the soil diazotrophic communities in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs. Additionally, the RDA results in Fig. 2 B and the correlation coefficients in Fig. 3 indicated that TN was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of Rhizobiales. Therefore, the abundance of Rhizobiales was closely related to the TN content in the soil. However, the abundance of Azohydromonas and Bradyrhizobium , which are known symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria ( Yousuf et al., 2014 ), was significantly negatively correlated with TN ( Figs. 2 B and 3 ). This finding indicated that in acidic soils, the abundances of these two types of diazotrophs were very sensitive to N, and their abundance decreased with increasing N content in soils; these findings are similar to those reported in a previous study by Wang et al. (2017) . Moreover, in the current study, NN was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of Anaeromyxobacter , Geobacter and Opitutaceae. Of these, a previous study indicated that Geobacter was an Fe(III)-reducing genus, and Bradyrhizobium had the ability to oxidize Fe(II) under anoxic conditions ( Straub et al., 2004 ; Chen et al., 2019b ). These characteristics indicated that in the mining area, diazotrophs might participate in anaerobic microbial iron cycling. Moreover, the RDA results indicated that K had a significant positive effect on Bradyrhizobium and Nostocaceae, yet it had a significant negative effect on Alphaproteobacteria. The data presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1 C also indicated that in citrus orchards, the most dominant phylum was Cyanobacteria rather than Proteobacteria. Therefore, in this study, the N (NN, AN and TN), P and K contents in soil displayed different effects on the relative abundances of diazotrophs among the different land use types.",
          "In the present study, the heavy metal concentration greatly influenced the diazotrophic community richness but had no significant effect on the diazotrophic community structure and distribution in the six land use types of soil. The phylum Cyanobacteria was the most dominant taxon in the diazotrophic community in the citrus orchard. However, in the soils of the five other land use types, phylum Proteobacteria was the most dominant taxon in the diazotrophic community. Moreover, the soil OM content in the citrus orchard was significantly higher than that in other areas, which might be the main reason for the difference in the diazotrophic community in the citrus orchard. Specifically, the TN content was the main reason for the high similarity among the soil diazotrophic communities in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs. Overall, our study offers a detailed description of the characteristics of the diazotroph community structure under different land use types around a mining area. Future research should focus on which microbial communities actively express their nifH gene and how specific diazotrophs function in areas affected by particular environmental factors. Such efforts will lead to a better understanding of nitrogen regulation, which is valuable for guiding ecological restoration and reconstruction around mines."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Landscapes dominated by human activities such as agriculture, industry and forestry can have fundamentally altered soil nutrient cycles and soil quality, and these factors consequently structure soil microbial communities ( Mganga et al., 2016 ; Wu et al., 2017 ). The soil microbial community is an important part of the soil ecosystem and participates in the cycling of specific soil materials and in biochemical reactions. Thus, the microbial community has a strong influence on soil quality and plant biomass production ( Hernández et al., 2016 ). With the development of modern molecular biology technology, high-throughput sequencing is now widely used to study microbial community composition and structural diversity ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Li et al., 2019a ). Rofner et al. (2017) analyzed the climate-related changes in soil characteristics that affected the bacterial community composition and function in high-altitude, high-latitude lakes by using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Oka and Uchida (2018) used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the impact of heavy metal stress on the structure and function of the soil bacterial community. Additionally, Wu et al. (2017) found that mercury (Hg), available phosphorus and soil moisture in electronic waste were the three major drivers affecting the composition and diversity of microbial communities by using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and clone library analyses. Thus, the influence of distinct soil environments on the diversity of soil microbial community structures has attracted widespread attention, and it has been suggested that soil microbial communities can adapt to variations in the local environment. Nitrogen is an essential element for all living organisms and is required for the biosynthesis of key cellular components, such as protein and nucleic acids ( Kuypers et al., 2018 ). Among the various nitrogen forms, biological nitrogen is rare in many environments despite being a key nutrient for plant and microbial growth and development; it controls plant productivity and microbial decomposition in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems ( Chen et al., 2019b ). Therefore, biogeochemical nitrogen cycling is particularly important. Among the nitrogen cycle processes, biological nitrogen fixation is important because it is the largest natural source of external nitrogen inputs to terrestrial ecosystems and is responsible for supporting primary productivity and maintaining ecosystem sustainability when anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are lacking ( LeBauer and Treseder, 2008 ; Chen et al., 2019b ). Biological nitrogen is fixed by nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) that fix atmospheric dinitrogen (N 2 ) via the nitrogenase protein complex. The dinitrogenase reductase ( nif H) gene is commonly used as a gene marked for the detection of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in the environment ( Kuypers et al., 2018 ). Diazotrophs are widespread in the environment and are found in diverse bacterial phyla, such as Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia ( Steenhoudt and Vanderleyden, 2000 ; Martinez-Perez et al., 2016 ; Penton et al., 2016 ; Delmont et al., 2018 ). The nitrogen fixation rate is directly associated with diazotrophic abundance and community composition, which is influenced by soil environmental changes caused by different land use types ( Hsu and Buckley, 2009 ; Tischer et al., 2015 ). Guangxi Province is known as the “hometown of nonferrous metals”; there are >6800 mines of all kinds in Guanxi Province, the highest number of any province in China ( Li et al., 2018 ). Different land use patterns around mining areas can change not only the structure and function of soil but also the biodiversity of soil microorganisms and can even cause the reconstruction of microbial communities ( Huang et al., 2018 ). Nitrogen fixation plays an important role in the reconstruction of ecosystems around mining areas. However, plant productivity is difficult to restore, and soil microbes are the main fixers in mining areas ( Hu et al., 2018 ). Broos et al. (2005) pointed out that symbiotic nitrogen fixation can be used to indicate metal toxicity in the field due to its clear ecological relevance. A previous study indicated that microbial compositions play key roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling and energy flow in mining areas ( Li et al., 2019c ). Huang et al. (2011) indicated that the abundance and activity of diazotrophs in copper mine tailings corresponded to changes in environmental conditions. Soil pH, carbon content, nutrient concentration, metal concentration, moisture, soil cover and slag depth were considered the predominant environmental factors around mining areas that largely restricted the diazotrophic population ( Che et al., 2017 ; Che et al., 2018 ; Singh and Gupta, 2018 ; Dashti et al., 2019 ; Han et al., 2019 ). Therefore, improving the diversity and community composition of diazotrophs and promoting the accumulation of nitrogen in mining areas has become a vital research focus along with a restoration challenge around mining areas. The Siding mining area is located in Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, China, with a total area of 13.64 km 2 ( Yin et al., 2008 ). Field surveys have indicated that the soil of the Siding mine area is seriously polluted by heavy metals, such as Pb, Zn and Cd ( Yin et al., 2008 ; Lu et al., 2010 ). Around the mining area, there are several land use types, and comparing the soil diazotrophic communities in different land use areas will help to better understand how diazotrophic communities are affected by complex environmental properties. Accordingly, in this study, soil samples (0–10 cm) were collected from different land use areas around the Siding mining area. The present work was undertaken with the following objectives: (a) to investigate the abundance, diversity, and community composition of diazotrophs in soils of different land use types and (b) to determine the distribution of diazotroph assemblages under different land use types in order to elucidate the main soil environmental properties that drive diazotroph community composition. Additionally, this study provides a theoretical basis for nitrogen regulation, ecological restoration and reconstruction around mining areas. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Soil sites and sample collection The Siding lead-zinc mine is located in Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, China (109°13′-109°47′ E, 24°46′-25°34′ N), and it has been in operation for >50 years. This area has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with annual rainfall and temperatures of 1650 mm and 20.6 °C, respectively. The soil around this region had been heavily contaminated by heavy metals such as lead, zinc, cadmium and copper. Sampling of the six land use types was performed around the mining area (Fig. S1), including a corn field (2 km upstream of a mining tailing), a vegetable field (3 km upstream of a mining tailing), shrubs (1 km downstream of a mining tailing), a mine tailing, forest (4 km upstream of a mining tailing) and a citrus orchard (3 km downstream of a mining tailing). The geographical coordinates and elevation relative to sea level of the six sample sites are presented in Table S1. At each site, three replicate soil samples (5 × 5 cm) with depths of 0 to 10 cm were randomly taken. A total of 18 soil samples were collected, and each sample was divided into three portions. One fresh subsample was stored at 4 °C for the analysis of soil ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 + -N) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 − -N) within seven days. The second fresh subsample was air-dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve for the analysis of soil physicochemical properties. The third fresh subsample was stored at −80 °C for DNA extraction. 2.2 Soil property analysis NH 4 + -N (AN) and NO 3 − -N (NN) were extracted with KCl solution (soil mass to solution ratio of 1:5) and determined by a continuous flow analyzer ( Che et al., 2018 ). The total nitrogen (TN) and soil organic matter (OM) contents were determined using the Kjeldahl method and the potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ) oxidation method, respectively ( Walkley and Black, 1934 ; Nelson and Sommers, 1982 ). Total phosphorus (TP) was determined using the Olsen method ( Olsen, 1954 ). The soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) values were determined using a pH meter (A211 Thermo Scientific, USA) and an EC meter (GLI3400, HACH, USA), respectively, in H 2 O using a 1:1 (w/v) soil:solution ratio ( Becerracastro et al., 2012 ). Soil metal (K, Ca, Na, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu) concentrations were measured using the method described by Kamran et al. (2019) . The metals were extracted with a mixture of 3:1:1 (v/v/v) concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), concentrated nitric acid (HNO 3 ) and concentrated perchloric acid (HClO 4 ), and the metal concentrations were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAnalyst 800, Perkin Elmer, USA). Nemerow's pollution index ( P N ) was used to evaluate the pollution status of the heavy metals from the six land use types around the mining area ( Zhao et al., 2019 ). 2.3 DNA extraction, qRT-PCR amplification and Illumina MiSeq sequencing Soil DNA was extracted from 0.5 g of soil, which was stored at −80 °C using the Fast® DNA SPIN Kit (MP Biomedical, Solon, OH, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extraction was subsequently purified using the Power Clean® DNA Clean-up Kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). Copies of the nifH gene were amplified by a polymerase chain reaction system (ABI GeneAmp 9700, Thermo Fisher, USA) with nifHF (5′-AAAGGYGGWATCGGYAARTCCACCAC-3′) and nifHR (5′-TTGTTSGCSGCRTACATSGCCAT CAT-3′) primers ( Chen et al., 2019a ). The amplification fragment length was approximately 450 bp. Each reaction mixture contained 10 ng of DNA template, 0.8 μL of each primer (5 μmol L −1 ), 4.0 μL of 5× FastPfu Buffer, 2.0 μL of dNTPs (2.5 mol L −1 ), 0.2 μL of bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.4 μL of TransStart® FastPfu DNA Polymerase (Trans, Beijing, China), with sterile ddH 2 O added to obtain a final volume of 20 μL. The PCR started with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 37 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s) and then an extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Finally, the PCR mixed product was recovered using the EZNA Gel Extraction Kit (Omega, USA), and the Illumina MiSeq PE300 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for sequencing and microbial community analysis. The raw sequence data of nifH were processed using the UPARSE analysis pipeline as recommended by Edgar (2010) with the QIIME software packages ( Caporaso et al., 2010 ) and Usearch method ( Edgar, 2010 ). Barcodes and primers were removed after the sample sequences were sorted. Translated proteins that matched the nifH gene-encoded protein sequence and did not contain termination codons were retained. Failed and chimeric sequences were also discarded based on their alignment against the nifH gene database ( Gaby and Buckley, 2014 ; Chen et al., 2019b ). Qualified sequences were clustered into nifH operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity level using UPARSE software (version 7.0.1). The α-diversity indices, including Shannon, Simpson and ACE indices, were calculated using the QIIME platform (version 1.9.1). 2.4 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 19.0 for Windows. An OTU-based analysis was performed to calculate the richness and diversity indices of samples, including the Shannon, Simpson and ACE diversity indices, for the six land use types. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan's multiple range test ( p < 0.05) was performed to determine the statistical significance of the Shannon, Simpson and ACE diversity indices among the different land use types. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed with CANOCO 5.0 to reveal the relationships between the diazotrophic assemblages at the genus level for samples collected from the six different land use locations, as well as the environmental factors. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between diversity indices (ACE index and NMDS1 scores) and soil properties. The Mantel test based on Bray-Curtis distances was used to analyze the relationships between soil properties and diazotrophic community structures. Spearman's correlation was used to test the relationship between nifH gene abundance at the phylum and class level and soil properties. The correlation coefficients for soil physicochemical properties in the different land use types were calculated with Pearson rank order correlation using SPSS 19.0 software. The soil physicochemical property values are presented as the means±standard deviation (SD). SD calculations were performed and figures created using Excel 2016. 2.5 Accession information All nifH sequences obtained from our research have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under accession number PRJNA579866. This project included six records: SAMN13135509 for the corn field, SAMN13135510 for the vegetable field, SAMN13135511 for the shrubs, SAMN13135512 for the mine tailing, SAMN13135513 for the forest, and SAMN13135514 for the orchard. 3 Results 3.1 Soil physicochemical properties and heavy metal concentrations The physicochemical properties of the soil samples from the six land use types are presented in Table 1 . The results indicated that the soil pH values of all six land use types were acidic (6.46 ± 0.08–6.88 ± 0.08). In particular, the soil pH value for the shrubs, 6.46 ± 0.08, was significantly lower than the other values ( p < 0.05), except that for the citrus orchard (6.51 ± 0.03). In addition, the EC in this area, 154.2 ± 6.8 μs·cm −1 , was significantly higher than that in the other areas ( p < 0.05). The TP, AP and TN contents in the soil sample from the vegetable field (773.3 ± 37.1, 29.85 ± 4.68 and 74.7 ± 4.0 mg·kg −1 , respectively) were higher than those in the other samples. Additionally, the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the soil sample from the vegetable field, 428.0 ± 2.6 mV, was significantly higher than that of the other samples ( p < 0.05). However, the NN content of the soil sample from the corn field, 2.80 ± 0.70 mg·kg −1 , was significantly higher than that of the other samples ( p < 0.05). The OM content of the soil sample from the citrus orchard, 52.7 ± 0.8 g·kg −1 , was significantly higher than that of the other samples ( p < 0.05). Moreover, there were no significant differences in AN among the six sampled land use types ( p > 0.05). The heavy metal concentrations of the soil samples from the six land use types are presented in Table 1 . The results indicated that the contents of lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) in the shrub soil sample (6245.0 ± 166.3, 20,983.3 ± 2744.9, 190.8 ± 2 and 83.9 ± 0.8 mg·kg −1 , respectively) were significantly higher than those in the other samples ( p < 0.05). Nemerow's pollution index for single heavy metals ( P i ) and Nemerow's pollution composite index ( P N ) were used to evaluate the heavy metal contamination level and are presented in Table S2. According to the P i value, all six sampled soils around the mine area were seriously polluted by Cd ( P i > 3) ( Zhao et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, except for the vegetable field, which was moderately polluted by Zn ( P i = 2.60), the other five sampled soils around the mine area were seriously polluted by Zn ( P i > 3). Moreover, four of the sampled soils, i.e., the shrub, mine tailing, forest and citrus orchard samples, were seriously polluted by Pb ( P i > 3); in contrast, the corn field was moderately polluted by Pb ( P i = 2.02). Cd was the most serious pollutant in the soils from the six land use types. According to their P N values, all six types of soils around the mine area were seriously polluted ( P N > 3), with the following order of average index values: shrubs (106.40) > citrus orchard (65.23) > forest (33.21) > mine tailing (31.01) > corn field (9.78) > vegetable field (1.55). 3.2 Diazotrophic community composition and diversity In total, we obtained 79232 nifH gene sequences from the six soil samples, and the total sequence number was reduced to 55,794 after quality filtering. The high-quality sequence number of each sample ranged from 3760 to 14,040. At a 97% similarity level, we obtained 339 OTUs with an average length of 427 bp per read (Table S3). The number of OTUs indicates the species richness and diversity ( Jing et al., 2015 ). In this study, the highest number of OTUs occurred in the corn field, while the lowest number of OTUs occurred in the shrubs. Alpha diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson and ACE) were further estimated based on the 97% OTU clusters and were significantly different among the six soil samples ( Fig. 1 A ). The Shannon and ACE indices reached their highest values in the corn field and their lowest values in the citrus orchard. Meanwhile, the Simpson index reached a minimum in the corn field, at an average of 0.06, and reached a maximum in the citrus orchard, at an average of 0.29. The relative diazotroph abundances at the phylum level collected from the six land use types are presented in Fig. 1 B. There were four dominant phyla: Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia. The phylum Proteobacteria was the most dominant diazotrophic community in the corn field, vegetable field, shrubs, mine tailing and forest, with a high abundance ranging from 60.08% to 99.96%. However, in the citrus orchard, the phylum Cyanobacteria was the most dominant diazotrophic community, with an abundance of 85.89%. The phylum Firmicutes was found only in the mine tailing, with an abundance of 2.49%. Moreover, the phylum Verrucomicrobia was found only in the corn field and vegetable field, with abundances of 0.02% and 0.01%, respectively. Most nitrogen-fixing Proteobacteria were classified as Alphaproteobacteria (66.04%). The dominant order in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs was Rhizobiales, which belongs to the class Alphaproteobacteria and had abundances of 52.18%, 77.47% and 51.31%, respectively ( Fig. 1 C). Additionally, the dominant genus in the mine tailing and forest was Bradyrhizobium , which also belongs to the class Alphaproteobacteria and had abundances of 43.55% and 19.33%, respectively. However, the dominant genus in the citrus orchard was Microcoleus , which belongs to the phylum Cyanobacteria and had an abundance of 49.19%. 3.3 The influence of soil physicochemical properties on diazotrophic community diversity and composition Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationships between diversity indices (ACE index and NMDS1 scores) and soil physicochemical properties ( Table 2 ). The results indicated that the soil heavy metal contents, including Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu, were highly correlated with the ACE index of the soil diazotrophic community ( p < 0.05). Moreover, soil pH and OM were highly correlated with the ACE index of the soil diazotrophic community ( p < 0.01). However, only soil TN was highly correlated with the NMDS1 score of the soil diazotrophic community, with F = 33.967, R 2 = 0.895, and p < 0.01 ( Table 2 ). Furthermore, the Mantel test presented in Table S4 indicated that the changes in the soil diazotrophic community structure were significantly correlated with soil TN ( p < 0.05). RDA was performed to analyze the relative influences of heavy metal concentrations (Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu, Fig. 2 A ), soil nutrients (AP, TN, NN and AN, Fig. 2 B), soil chemical properties (K, Ca, Na and Mg, Fig. 2 C), and soil physical properties (pH, OM, ORP and EC Fig. 2 D) on the diazotrophic community composition. The explanatory variable redundancy analysis for the soil diazotrophic community structures is presented in Table S5. The RDA results from Fig. 2 A show that the first two axes explained 29.6% and 24.3% of the total variation, respectively. In addition, heavy metal combinational variables accounted for 88.05% of the observed changes in the diazotrophic community composition, which indicated that changes in heavy metals significantly affected the diazotrophic community. In addition, the combination of soil nutrients, soil chemical properties and soil physical properties accounted for 80.39%, 85.22% and 79.75%, respectively, of the observed changes in the diazotrophic community composition. The heatmap based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficients was used to analyze the relationship between environmental parameters and relative abundances of diazotrophs at the genus level ( Fig. 3 ). The abundance of the diazotrophic family Opitutaceae was negatively correlated with Pb, Zn, Cu and the C/N ratio ( p < 0.05). Additionally, the abundance of the diazotrophic genus Rhodomicrobium was negatively correlated with Pb and Cu ( p < 0.05). Cu was positively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic family Bradyrhizobiaceae ( p < 0.01). K was positively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic genus Bradyrhizobium and the diazotrophic family Nostocaceae ( p < 0.05). However, K was negatively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic class Alphaproteobacteria. Regarding nutrients, the abundance of the diazotrophic family Bradyrhizobiaceae was positively correlated with AN ( p < 0.01). Additionally, NN was positively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic genera Anaeromyxobacter ( p < 0.001) and Geobacter ( p < 0.05) and the diazotrophic family Opitutaceae ( p < 0.01). Furthermore, TN was positively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic order Rhizobiales ( p < 0.05) but negatively correlated with the abundance of the diazotrophic genera Azohydromonas ( p < 0.01) and Bradyrhizobium ( p < 0.05). The abundance of the diazotrophic family Opitutaceae was also positively correlated with AP, TP and ORP ( p < 0.05). The abundance of the diazotrophic genus Microcoleus was positively correlated with soil OM and TC ( p < 0.05). 4 Discussion The mining industry creates substantial economic benefits but causes ecological degradation in mining areas. During the process of restoring soil fertility in mining areas, the poor physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as its lack of soil OM, water, and nutrients and its high heavy metal contamination, become the main limiting factors for ecological restoration and reconstruction ( Cooke and Johnson, 2002 ; Li, 2006 ). Among them, extreme soil nitrogen deficiency is the primary type of nutrient deficiency ( Festin et al., 2019 ). Microbes are of vital importance in ecosystem maintenance and function, especially in nitrogen cycling. Nitrogen fixation carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea is fundamentally important for relieving the nitrogen limitation constraints of an ecosystem ( Jing et al., 2015 ). Heavy metal contamination in the soil around mining areas is serious, and the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and other physicochemical properties in the soil vary greatly among different land use types (Cao et al., 2018). In the present study, serious heavy metal contamination was observed in all six soils, especially in the shrub sampling area. In contrast, the concentrations of heavy metals in the vegetable field and corn field were relatively lower than those in the other areas. This may have been due to the upstream sampling location of these two areas, which would limit their exposure to runoff from the mining area. Additionally, TP, AP, TN and NN in the corn field and vegetable field and soil OM in the citrus orchard were significantly higher than those in the other areas ( Table 1 ). This may have been due to the fertilization, irrigation and cultivation of these areas ( Zhao et al., 2019 ). Proteobacteria are ubiquitous and highly diverse in terms of metabolism; they have one of the most important roles in nutrient cycling and are widespread in various environments ( Jing et al., 2015 ; Chen et al., 2019a ). One previous study indicated that Proteobacteria is considered to be the predominant microbiota in mining areas located in Northern Ontario, Canada, where the soil is contaminated by Ni and Cu ( Narendrula-Kotha and Nkongolo, 2017 ). Moreover, Proteobacteria is also considered to be the predominant microbiota in mining areas located in southwest Slovakia, where the soil contains high concentrations of Ni, cobalt (Co) and Zn ( Karelová et al., 2011 ). In the present study, Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in most of the land use types and mainly consisted of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. Among them, taxa such as Rhizobiales, Bradyrhizobiaceae, Bradyrhizobium , Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter are well known for forming root nodules with legumes and conducting symbiotic nitrogen fixation ( Oldroyd and Downie, 2008 ; Che et al., 2018 ). Therefore, the high proportions of these diazotrophs indicate the potential importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation for providing nitrogen input in this mining area. However, in the citrus orchard, nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria was the most abundant diazotroph phylum. Broadly speaking, Cyanobacteria are autotrophic; they are some of the most dominant diazotrophs in aquatic ecosystems and are widely found in the nodules of plants ( Schulz et al., 2013 ; Martinez-Perez et al., 2016 ; Lu and Lu, 2019 ). Among the Cyanobacteria, Microcoleus are known to build microbial relationships in a variety of environments, and they contain a complete nif -gene cluster ( Bolhuis et al., 2010 ; Jing et al., 2015 ). These findings might indicate that the soil diazotroph community was dominated by autotrophs in the citrus orchard. In particular, in the mine tailing, we also detected nitrogen-fixing Firmicutes that were mainly identified as Paenibacillus at the genus level. Karelová et al. (2011) indicated that Firmicutes can live in extreme environments and have the potential to repair broad-spectrum heavy metal contamination. In addition, previous studies have indicated that Paenibacillus are nitrogen-fixing bacteria ( Lopes de Sá et al., 2019 ). Paenibacillus are distributed in various habitats and have been isolated from decomposing plant materials, human-enriched soils, mining area soils and other soil samples ( Cho et al., 2019 ; Steinbock et al., 2019 ). Moreover, nitrogen-fixing Verrucomicrobia were found only in the corn field and vegetable field and were mainly identified as Opitutaceae at the family level. Previous research has indicated that Opitutaceae can be isolated from the anorectums of white ants, but their role in nitrogen fixing is not yet clear ( Kotak et al., 2015 ; Che et al., 2018 ). Exposure to a large amount of heavy metals increases the establishment of tolerant microbial communities, which leads to a reduction in microbial diversity and substantially changes the microbial community structure ( Guo et al., 2017 ). Multiple linear regression indicated that soil Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu significantly influenced the ACE index of the diazotrophic community ( Table 2 ). A high concentration of heavy metals can significantly decrease the ACE index ( Chodak et al., 2013 ). In the present study, in the shrub and citrus orchard sampling areas where heavy metal concentrations were relatively higher than those in other areas, the ACE indices were relatively low ( Fig. 1 A). However, there was no significant correlation between the soil heavy metal concentration and the diazotrophic community structure according to the Mantel test (Table S4). Therefore, soil heavy metal concentrations are found to mainly influence diazotrophic community richness but have no significant effect on diazotrophic community structure and distribution. Another previous study indicated that soil contaminated with heavy metals could adversely alter the composition of the soil diazotrophic community ( Wang et al., 2019 ). In the current study, the shrubs were located 1 km downstream of the mining area, where the heavy metal content in the soil was the highest. Compared to their abundance in the other land use types, Alphaproteobacteria were the most dominant bacteria in the shrub soil. In citrus orchards, the heavy metal content was also very high, and the P N value presented in Table S2 indicated that the pollution level in this area was second only to that in the shrub soil. However, Cyanobacteria were the most dominant bacteria in this area and were mainly identified as Microcoleus at the genus level. The main reason for this difference may be that the soil OM and TC contents and the C/N ratio were different between the two land use types. Deng et al. (2020) indicated that soil TC and OM contents and the C/N ratio strongly influenced the soil bacterial community structure in iron (Fe) mining in China. Eo and Park (2016) pointed out that soil OM was provided as root debris and exudates, and the activity of microorganisms is positively related to the soil OM content ( Graham and Haynes, 2005 ). Che et al. (2018) found that the soil OM content could be one of the main factors influencing the soil bacterial community. In our study, the results presented in Table 1 and Fig. 3 indicated that TC and OM content in citrus orchards was significantly higher than those in other sites and had a significant positive correlation with the abundance of the diazotrophic genus Microcoleus . Additionally, multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the soil OM content was more highly correlated with the ACE index of the soil diazotrophic community ( Table 2 ). Consequently, in this study, the difference in soil OM and TC content might be one of the main factors influencing the diazotrophic communities in different land use types around the Siding mining area. In addition, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are important nutrients that affect soil enzyme activities, microbial biomass and communities and various other soil properties ( Ajwa et al., 1999 ; Li et al., 2019b ). First, N-related soil properties such as TN, NN and AN levels are the most dominant factors influencing the diazotrophic community structure in soil ( Zhong et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, P and K are two common and accessible macronutrients required for plant growth, and they also influence the diazotrophic community structure and diversity in soils ( Azziz et al., 2012 ; Samaddar et al., 2019 ). Although most P in soil is not bioavailable, AP is an appropriate measure of P bioavailability for soil microbes ( Wu et al., 2017 ). In the present study, TN was one of the key factors that strongly influenced the soil diazotrophic community diversity and structure. Specifically, TN was highly correlated with the NMDS1 score of the soil diazotrophic community, and the TN content in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs was significantly higher than those in the other three areas. The dominant order in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs was Rhizobiales. Rhizobiales is a well-known diazotroph that forms root nodules with legumes that can enhance nitrogen fixation even in the presence of heavy metals ( Belimov et al., 2019 ). Hence, the effect of TN on the soil diazotrophic community was mainly reflected in the β -diversity, which indicated that the soil TN content was the main reason for the high similarity among the soil diazotrophic communities in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs. Additionally, the RDA results in Fig. 2 B and the correlation coefficients in Fig. 3 indicated that TN was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of Rhizobiales. Therefore, the abundance of Rhizobiales was closely related to the TN content in the soil. However, the abundance of Azohydromonas and Bradyrhizobium , which are known symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria ( Yousuf et al., 2014 ), was significantly negatively correlated with TN ( Figs. 2 B and 3 ). This finding indicated that in acidic soils, the abundances of these two types of diazotrophs were very sensitive to N, and their abundance decreased with increasing N content in soils; these findings are similar to those reported in a previous study by Wang et al. (2017) . Moreover, in the current study, NN was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of Anaeromyxobacter , Geobacter and Opitutaceae. Of these, a previous study indicated that Geobacter was an Fe(III)-reducing genus, and Bradyrhizobium had the ability to oxidize Fe(II) under anoxic conditions ( Straub et al., 2004 ; Chen et al., 2019b ). These characteristics indicated that in the mining area, diazotrophs might participate in anaerobic microbial iron cycling. Moreover, the RDA results indicated that K had a significant positive effect on Bradyrhizobium and Nostocaceae, yet it had a significant negative effect on Alphaproteobacteria. The data presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1 C also indicated that in citrus orchards, the most dominant phylum was Cyanobacteria rather than Proteobacteria. Therefore, in this study, the N (NN, AN and TN), P and K contents in soil displayed different effects on the relative abundances of diazotrophs among the different land use types. In the present study, the heavy metal concentration greatly influenced the diazotrophic community richness but had no significant effect on the diazotrophic community structure and distribution in the six land use types of soil. The phylum Cyanobacteria was the most dominant taxon in the diazotrophic community in the citrus orchard. However, in the soils of the five other land use types, phylum Proteobacteria was the most dominant taxon in the diazotrophic community. Moreover, the soil OM content in the citrus orchard was significantly higher than that in other areas, which might be the main reason for the difference in the diazotrophic community in the citrus orchard. Specifically, the TN content was the main reason for the high similarity among the soil diazotrophic communities in the corn field, vegetable field and shrubs. Overall, our study offers a detailed description of the characteristics of the diazotroph community structure under different land use types around a mining area. Future research should focus on which microbial communities actively express their nifH gene and how specific diazotrophs function in areas affected by particular environmental factors. Such efforts will lead to a better understanding of nitrogen regulation, which is valuable for guiding ecological restoration and reconstruction around mines.
