    "full_text": "As the most productive fruit in the world, there is a lack of research on disease resistance mechanisms in citrus. WRKY transcription factors are mediators of disease resistance in plants. In this research, CsWRKY23, which could respond to exogenous salicylic acid (SA) was identified. As a variant WRKY, the transient overexpression of CsWRKY23 in citrus peel enhanced the resistance to Penicillium digitatum . The potential targets of CsWRKY23 were identified by using DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq). In combination with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, 48 direct target genes of CsWRKY23 were identified. In addition, five genes for EMSA and dual-luciferase report system analysis were selected and the results showed that CsWRKY23 activate CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 expressions. Further analysis revealed that CsWRKY23 contributed to SA synthesis pathway, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and cell wall strengthening. This study presented a possible regulatory network for disease resistance involving the CsWRKY23."

          "During plants growth and development, they are affected by many stress factors, for which they must develop adaptation strategies through complex changes in their biochemical and physiological pathways ( Liu et al., 2017 ). In this context, WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins involved in the development of plant resistance to biotic stress by gene expression, which can be induced by the treatment with salicylic acid (SA) and pathogenic microorganisms ( Yang et al., 2009 ).",
          "WRKYs commonly contain at least one WRKY structural domain (WRKYGQK motif) that specifically binds to the W-box [(T)(T)TGAC(C/T)] and regulates the transcription of genes ( Rushton et al., 2010 ). It has been reported the important role of WRKYs on the regulatory effects of the disease resistance responses in plants with a high economic impact such as poplar, strawberry, cotton and apple ( Duan et al., 2015; Encinas-Villarejo et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2020 ). In a previous work, the disease resistance of a model crop ( Arabidopsis) associated to WRKYs were deeply studied; however, its effect in non-model crops as the aforementioned plants is still unknown. SA plays a key role in plant signaling and stress response as a signaling molecule that activates the hypersensitive response (HR) and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) ( Miura and Tada, 2014 ). It has been reported that the SA biosynthetic and signaling pathways in plants are also regulated by WRKYs. A key gene in the SA signaling pathway is NPR1 , which has a W-box on its promoter, while Arabidopsis AtWRKY6 can regulate the expression of NPR1 ( Robatzek and Somssich, 2002 ). AtWRKY70 promotes SARD1 expression and SA production ( Zhou et al., 2018 ). It was reported by Chen et al. that SA promotes the accumulation of H 2 O 2 in plants, which leads to an increase in their systemic resistance ( Chen et al., 1993 ). Considering that defense pathways are not independent, they have shown synergistic or antagonistic effects on each other in response to different pathogenic infestations. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was essential in the activation of defense genes, strengthening cell wall and activate the transcriptional function of TFs ( Gao et al., 2018 ).",
          "Citrus fruit is one of the main fruit industries worldwide, having increased its production by 19.6 % over the last decade ( Scuderi et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023 ). However, postharvest citrus decay caused by pathogenic fungus such as Penicillium digitatum (green mold) still being a severe problem, causing quality loses and generating large amounts of waste and economic loses. P. digitatum is infectious pathogenic to citrus fruits. The spores of P. digitatum is usually found on the surface of harvested citrus fruits. Once the fruits were mechanically damaged during harvesting, transportation and handling, spores would take the opportunity to colonize and germinate in a suitable environment. In addition, P. digitatum spores are easily dispersed through the air, causing massive fruit rot. Unfortunately, nowadays there is little research focused on the regulation mechanisms of biotic stress in citrus fruit. Therefore, a deep study involving the molecular mechanisms of disease resistance of citrus are necessary. The literature to date has shown that CsWRKY65 is involved in mediating the accumulation of ROS to enhance disease resistance in citrus fruit ( Wang et al., 2021 ), CsWRKY70 participate in the endogenous SA signaling pathway ( Deng et al., 2020 ), and CsWRKY22 enhance the susceptibility to canker ( Long et al., 2021 ).",
          "Based on the results of previous studies by our group, it was shown that the disease resistance response of citrus fruits was activated after treatment with the exogenous hormone SA, and several disease resistance related genes and WRKY transcription factors were identified as significantly up regulated expression using transcriptome sequencing. Specifically, CsWRKY23 is a variant WRKY in which the WRKY residue in WRKYGQK is replaced by a WKKY motif. However, researches on variant WRKY transcription factors were limited. The purpose of the present research was to identify, clone and characterize CsWRKY23 to be responsive to exogenous SA. Also, the direct target genes of CsWRKY23 were identified by combined DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the possible mechanism of the regulatory network of CsWRKY23 on disease resistance was explored."

The promoter regions of CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 were analyzed, and it was determined to contain W-box elements (Text S1). As shown in Fig. 5 A, the CsWRKY23 recombinant protein could directly bind to the W-box of CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 promoter regions, resulting in distinct binding bands. Meanwhile, the shift bands disappeared as the concentration used for the cold probe increased and the concentration of the mutation probe (AAAA/TTTT) used does not affect the shift bands. In addition, a dual-luciferase report system to analyze the transcriptional activation of CsWRKY23 on these genes were constructed. Fig. 5 B shows that the presence of CsWRKY23 significantly increased the ratio of LUC to REN compared to the control (pEAQ), for the reporters constructed by CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 . These results illustrated that CsWRKY23 could specifically bind to the W-box of the promoters of these genes and act to activate their expression."

              "The expression of the above five target genes ( CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 ) in overexpressed CsWRKY23 citrus peel using RT-qPCR were examined. As Fig. 6 shows, the expression of all these genes was significantly increased compared to the control. Furthermore, the content of downstream substances of some important target genes were analyzed ( Fig. 6 ). Firstly, the content of free and bound SA was measured, and the results showed that the content of bound SA was significantly higher than the control group, while the content of free SA did not change. Taken together, the total SA content was significantly raised compared to the control. In addition, since CsRbohD and CsGSTL3 were the direct target genes of CsWRKY23, the hydrogen peroxide content, lignin content and GST activity were measured. Results showed a significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the peel of citrus fruit overexpressing CsWRKY23 , which was manifested by an increase in hydrogen peroxide content. Meanwhile, GST enzyme activity was significantly increased, indicating the activation of antioxidant system. The accumulation of lignin indicates enhanced resistance of citrus peel to pathogenic fungi. Briefly, these data implied that CsWRKY23 improved disease resistance in citrus fruit by activating multiple pathways, such as SA metabolic pathway, reactive oxygen metabolism, etc."

          "WRKY transcription factor family is involved in the regulation of important plant stress responses. They are widely associated with the growth and development regulation and biotic or abiotic stress in plants. Functional WRKYs analysis have focused on some model crops, such as Arabidopsis , rice, and tomato ( Kim et al., 2006; Hsu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017 ). However, the function of WRKYs in non-model crops is still poorly investigated, especially in woody perennial species such as citrus. In addition, due to the differences between species, the regulatory patterns of homologous transcription factors in model crops do not correspond exactly to non-model crops. Therefore, it is important to investigate the mechanisms of WRKY transcription factor regulation of disease resistance response in citrus, which is considered an important agricultural product.",
          "In this study, CsWRKY23 in citrus fruit peel that could respond to exogenous SA induction were identified and cloned. This suggested that CsWRKY23 is involved in mediating the resistance of citrus fruit to P. digitatum . Multiple sequence analysis revealed that CsWRKY23 is a variant of WRKY TF localized in the nucleus ( Fig. 1 ). Although the structural domain of WRKY is generally highly conserved, it has been reported the substitution of WRKYGQK amino acid sequence in some species such as maize, banana, populus, mulberry, soybean and rice ( Eulgem et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017 ). WRKY can bind to the W-box of the promoter region of its target genes and to transcriptionally regulate the target genes expression ( Yamasaki et al., 2013 ). It has also been reported that the binding site of the variant WRKY TFs could be altered ( Van Verk et al., 2008 ). However, there are few reports about the binding site of WRKY TF with core sequence WKKY, and if it could bind to W-box and to other sites, it will require further identification. Firstly, yeast transformation system and dual-luciferase reporter system in tobacco leaves were used, and it has been demonstrated that CsWRKY23 is a transcriptional activator ( Fig. 1 ). These results suggested that CsWRKY23 could transcriptionally activate downstream disease resistance genes. To further clarify the molecular function of CsWRKY23, transient overexpression of CsWRKY23 in citrus peel revealed a significant increase in the resistance of citrus fruit to P. digitatum ( Fig. 2 ).",
          "To obtain more information about the process of CsWRKY23 in the regulation of disease resistance in citrus fruit, as well as to identify its binding sites and direct target genes, DAP-seq and RNA-seq were used for the analysis. Based on the results of DAP-seq, 5434 peaks were identified, and the DNA-binding site of CsWRKY23 showed the highest distribution in the adjacent region of TSS. Significantly enriched motifs were obtained using the MEME program Suite. Among them, motif 1 was the most abundant in the peak-related genes and its sequence was identical to the W-box commonly bound to WRKY TFs ( Fig. 3 ). This indicated that the variant CsWRKY23 has a general WRKY binding property and the ability to transcriptionally activate or repress target genes. In addition, RNA-seq was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes in CsWRKY23 overexpressed in citrus peel. Among them, 389 genes were up-regulated, and 467 genes were down-regulated. Also, it was observed that the expression of some potential CsWRKY23 target genes was not significantly changed, suggesting that these CsWRKY23 target genes might be involved in other developmental processes or expressed only under certain physiological conditions. By merging the data from DAP-seq and RNA-seq, 29 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated expressed genes were obtained ( Fig. 4 A). These 48 genes were considered as the direct regulatory target genes of CsWRKY23, suggesting that CsWRKY23 might act as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. In the present study, it was found that CsWRKY23 might be associated with genes of some metabolic pathways and transcriptionally repress the expression of these genes, such as lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides and other amino acids metabolisms. It is generally considered that the process of plant disease resistance is energy consuming and at the same time, plants may reduce its growth and development rates, increasing its resistance to diseases ( Jing et al., 2019 ).",
          "On the other hand, it was believed that PTI6 promote the expression of disease-related genes ( Wang et al., 2021 ), however, results showed that it is regulated by transcriptional repression of CsWRKY23. It could be due to the plant disease resistance response is a complex regulatory network in which multiple genes are involved in the coordination of each other, and protein modifications of transcription factors also influence the disease resistance response. The analysis of the interrelationship of individual genes and proteins is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of the disease resistance process in fruits.",
          "Up-regulated expression of target genes of CsWRKY23 were further analyzed. Results showed that several of these genes were directly associated with plant disease resistance, and five of them ( CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 ) were selected for validation. Up-regulated expression of RbohD genes may lead the accumulation of ROS, which is essential in the defense system of plants ( Camejo et al., 2016; Segal and Wilson, 2018 ). GST is an important detoxification enzyme that scavenges H 2 O 2 , which is essential for the balance with the oxidative stress in plants. CsWRKY22 in sweet orange could enhance the susceptibility to canker ( Long et al., 2021 ). SARD1 is a key regulator of the induction of SA synthesis. In Arabidopsis , AtWRKY70 promotes SARD1 expression and thus, SA production ( Zhou et al., 2018 ). IQM6 belongs to calmodulin-binding family protein, and it is presumed to be associated with cell wall strengthening. AAE12 encodes an acyl-activating enzyme, which is considered to be an important enzyme in the benzene propane biosynthetic pathway ( Colquhoun et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, EMSA and dual-luciferase reporter system were used, and the results showed that CsWRKY23 could specifically bind to the W-box of the promoters of these genes and activate their expression ( Fig. 5 ). Gene expression levels, H 2 O 2 content, lignin content and GST activity enzyme activity content in overexpressed CsWRKY23 citrus peel were also studied. Results showed that the overexpression of CsWRKY23 caused up-regulation of CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 , elevation of endogenous SA content, accumulation of H 2 O 2 and enhancement of GST enzyme activity. Lignin, a major component of plant cell walls, particularly important in the defense against pathogens, was also identified with increased content ( Fig. 6 ).",
          "As a corresponding SA-inducible transcription factor CsWRKY23, which in turn promoted the synthesis of endogenous SA content, which was essential for the establishment of citrus disease resistance ( Miura and Tada, 2014 ). Chen et al. suggested that SA promotes the accumulation of H 2 O 2 content in plants ( Chen et al., 1993 ), which leads to an increase in plant systemic resistance. The elevated GST enzyme activity reduces the excessive oxidative stress on citrus cells, which is a very important detoxification mechanism. The above evidence confirm that CsWRKY23 regulate multiple pathways to promote disease resistance in citrus fruit."

          "No efficient and stable transgenic system has been established, so there are limitations to investigate the functions of important genes and proteins in citrus fruits. Our research elucidated the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of CsWRKY23 as an exogenous SA-induced variant WRKY involved in fruit disease resistance, which involves critical responses including the SA synthesis pathway, ROS accumulation, and cell wall strengthening. Results implied that the coordination of multiple pathways contributed to the increased the resistance of citrus fruits diseases affected with P. digitatum. Moreover, resistance enhancement is the coordination of multiple pathways, which is extremely complex. Protein interactions and protein modifications also play important roles in the fruit disease resistance response, and it requires further research to elucidate. This study provides new information on the mechanisms related to the WRKY involvement in disease resistance in citrus sinensis fruits."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction During plants growth and development, they are affected by many stress factors, for which they must develop adaptation strategies through complex changes in their biochemical and physiological pathways ( Liu et al., 2017 ). In this context, WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins involved in the development of plant resistance to biotic stress by gene expression, which can be induced by the treatment with salicylic acid (SA) and pathogenic microorganisms ( Yang et al., 2009 ). WRKYs commonly contain at least one WRKY structural domain (WRKYGQK motif) that specifically binds to the W-box [(T)(T)TGAC(C/T)] and regulates the transcription of genes ( Rushton et al., 2010 ). It has been reported the important role of WRKYs on the regulatory effects of the disease resistance responses in plants with a high economic impact such as poplar, strawberry, cotton and apple ( Duan et al., 2015; Encinas-Villarejo et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2020 ). In a previous work, the disease resistance of a model crop ( Arabidopsis) associated to WRKYs were deeply studied; however, its effect in non-model crops as the aforementioned plants is still unknown. SA plays a key role in plant signaling and stress response as a signaling molecule that activates the hypersensitive response (HR) and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) ( Miura and Tada, 2014 ). It has been reported that the SA biosynthetic and signaling pathways in plants are also regulated by WRKYs. A key gene in the SA signaling pathway is NPR1 , which has a W-box on its promoter, while Arabidopsis AtWRKY6 can regulate the expression of NPR1 ( Robatzek and Somssich, 2002 ). AtWRKY70 promotes SARD1 expression and SA production ( Zhou et al., 2018 ). It was reported by Chen et al. that SA promotes the accumulation of H 2 O 2 in plants, which leads to an increase in their systemic resistance ( Chen et al., 1993 ). Considering that defense pathways are not independent, they have shown synergistic or antagonistic effects on each other in response to different pathogenic infestations. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was essential in the activation of defense genes, strengthening cell wall and activate the transcriptional function of TFs ( Gao et al., 2018 ). Citrus fruit is one of the main fruit industries worldwide, having increased its production by 19.6 % over the last decade ( Scuderi et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023 ). However, postharvest citrus decay caused by pathogenic fungus such as Penicillium digitatum (green mold) still being a severe problem, causing quality loses and generating large amounts of waste and economic loses. P. digitatum is infectious pathogenic to citrus fruits. The spores of P. digitatum is usually found on the surface of harvested citrus fruits. Once the fruits were mechanically damaged during harvesting, transportation and handling, spores would take the opportunity to colonize and germinate in a suitable environment. In addition, P. digitatum spores are easily dispersed through the air, causing massive fruit rot. Unfortunately, nowadays there is little research focused on the regulation mechanisms of biotic stress in citrus fruit. Therefore, a deep study involving the molecular mechanisms of disease resistance of citrus are necessary. The literature to date has shown that CsWRKY65 is involved in mediating the accumulation of ROS to enhance disease resistance in citrus fruit ( Wang et al., 2021 ), CsWRKY70 participate in the endogenous SA signaling pathway ( Deng et al., 2020 ), and CsWRKY22 enhance the susceptibility to canker ( Long et al., 2021 ). Based on the results of previous studies by our group, it was shown that the disease resistance response of citrus fruits was activated after treatment with the exogenous hormone SA, and several disease resistance related genes and WRKY transcription factors were identified as significantly up regulated expression using transcriptome sequencing. Specifically, CsWRKY23 is a variant WRKY in which the WRKY residue in WRKYGQK is replaced by a WKKY motif. However, researches on variant WRKY transcription factors were limited. The purpose of the present research was to identify, clone and characterize CsWRKY23 to be responsive to exogenous SA. Also, the direct target genes of CsWRKY23 were identified by combined DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the possible mechanism of the regulatory network of CsWRKY23 on disease resistance was explored. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Pathogen, fruits and treatments The spores of P. digitatum were collected after 7 days of incubation on potato dextrose agar (PDA) as was described by Deng et al. ( Deng et al., 2020 ). Citrus fruits [ Citrus sinensis Osbeck cv. Beibei 447 Jincheng] were obtained at optimum commercial maturity (80 % of the peel is orange in color and the ratio of the total soluble solids content to titratable acid content is about 10). Salicylic acid was solubilized with 0.02 % Tween-80 at 2 mmol L −1 . Fruits were immersed into the solution for 30 min and then rinsed with distilled water and air-dried. Distilled water was used as the control treatment. After 24 h, wounds were made on both sides of the equator of the fruit and they were inoculated with 10 μL of 5 × 10 4 CFU mL −1 suspension of P. digitatum spores; then, the fruit were bagged and stored at 25 °C, 90 %–95 % RH. Citrus peel samples (about 1 cm around the inoculation site) were excised and frozen during 0, 8 and 48 h. Each treatment consisted of three independent biological replicates at each time point, containing 15 fruits ( Deng et al., 2020 ). 2.2 Gene Isolation, sequence analysis and qRT-PCR analysis RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as was described by Moore et al. and Wang et al ( Moore et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2021 ). The complete transcription sequence of CsWRKY23 (LOC102625492) was cloned, which was consistent with the NCBI database. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree of CsWRKY23 was performed by Tbtools ( https://github.com/CJ-Chen/TBtools ) and MEGA7. The relative gene expression was assayed by qRT-PCR, and the actin gene (GenBank accession: GU911361, CAP ID: Cs1g05000) was used as described previously ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Expression levels were normalized to the actin genes. 2.3 Subcellular localization Tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) were grown in a greenhouse under controlled conditions (25 °C, 16/8h of light/dark). To generate constructs for subcellular localization, CDS without stop codon of CsWRKY23 was cloned into the pEAQ-GFP vector and fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), resulting in pEAQ-CsWRKY23-GFP, which was then transformed into Agrobacterium EHA105. pEAQ-CsWRKY23-GFP and pEAQ-GFP were transiently co-expressed with a nuclear marker (mCherry-H2B) in tobacco leaves. After 2 d, the GFP signals were detected with an TS100 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). 2.4 Transcriptional activation analysis in yeast cells The transcriptional activation activity of CsWRKY23 was tested using a yeast transformation system (Clontech, CA, USA). pGBKT7-CsWRKY23 vector was built according to the method described in our previous research ( Wang et al., 2021 ). The transformants were cultured on SD/-Trp or SD/-Trp-His-Ade media (Coolaber, Beijing, China) and transcriptional activation activity was judged based on growth well in SD/-Trp-His-Ade media and the activity of X-α-Gal. 2.5 Agrobacterium -mediated transient transformation in citrus fruit peel Transient transformation assays were performed in citrus fruits using the protocol described previously ( Wang et al., 2021 ). To generate overexpression constructs, the CDS of CsWRKY23 was ligated to the pEAQ vector and the empty vector was used as a negative control. The constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium EHA105, and the cells (0.5 mL 0.5 OD 600 units) were injected into the citrus fruit peel. After 2 h, two new holes were drilled 1 cm from the original injection site and P. digitatum spores (10 μL, 1 × 10 4 CFU mL −1 ) were inoculated. After injection, all fruits were stored in the dark at 25 °C and the development of the disease was daily measured. In addition, citrus peel tissue infiltrated only with pEAQ-CsWRKY23 (OE23) or PEAQ (Control) was sampled. Sampling area was circular injection site for analysis of gene expression and RNA-seq. At least three biological parallels were prepared for each group, and 15 fruits were measured in each parallel. 2.6 DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) The DAP gDNA library was constructed and the DAP reaction was performed as was previously described ( O’Malley et al., 2016; Bartlett et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019 ). Genomic DNA was extracted from tender leaves of citrus tree. The enriched gDNA was fragmented into about 200 bp using the Covaris M220 ultrasonicator (Covaris, MA, USA). The fragmented gDNA was end-repaired and 3′A added. Then, the adaptor was ligated to the fragmented gDNA. The Halo-CsWRKY23 vector was constructed by reconstituting the full-length open reading frame of CsWRKY23 into the pFN19K HaloTag® T7 SP6 Flexi® Vector vector, and then the Halo-CsWRKY23 recombinant protein was expressed according to the instructions of the TNT SP6 Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega, Fitchburg, USA). The recombinant proteins were purified using Magne Halo-Tag beads (Promega, Fitchburg, USA), confirmed by Western blot, and quantified by semi-quantitative dot blot analysis. Then, DAP gDNA library was incubated with Halo-CsWRKY23 recombinant protein at room temperature for 1 h. Eluted DNA was PCR amplified sequenced using Illumina HiSeq™ 4000 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. (Guangzhou, China). After Illumina sequencing, the clean DAP-seq date were aligned to the genome of the Citrus sinensis v 2.0 using Bowtie2 (version 2.2.5). All reads from additional 2 kb upstream and downstream of the transcriptional initiation site (TSS) and transcriptional termination site (TES) were counted by deepTools (version: 3.2.0) software. The peaks were identified using MACS2 (version 2.1.2) with q-value < 0.05. Peak related genes were annotated by the ChIPseeker R package and the distribution of the peaks on different genome regions was analized. MEME suit ( https://meme-suite.org/ ) was used to detect the motifs. 2.7 RNA-seq analysis Transient overexpression of CsWRKY23 in citrus peel was used for RNA sequencing analysis as was described above. Subsequently, RNA-seq library was constructed and was sequenced on Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. (Guangzhou, China). Based on the variance analysis, significantly different genes were screened with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and |log2 fold change| > 1 ( Love et al., 2014 ). 2.8 Recombinant protein preparation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) Based on the target gene information of CsWRKY23 obtained by combined DAP-seq and RNA-seq analysis, the promoter fragments of CsAAE12 , CsRbohD, CsSARD1, CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 genes were amplified by PCR. The W-box (TTGAC) elements of each promoter region were identified. EMSA analysis of whether CsWRKY23 could bind to the W-box of these target gene promoters. CsWRKY23 was constructed into the pGEX-4T-1 vector to obtain recombinant and purified CsWRKY23 in vitro proteins. EMSA assays were performed as was previously described ( Wang et al., 2021 ). DNA probes were prepared by using EMSA Probe Biotin Labeling Kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China). The probe containing the W-box (CCGAC) from the promoters were labeled with biotin. The unlabeled sequence was used for competition assays. The mutant probe was generated by replacing the 5′-TTGAC-3′ motif with 5′-TTTTT-3′. The Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) was used for the detection of the biotinylated probes. 2.9 Promoter isolation, analysis and Dual-luciferase reporter assays To verify the transcriptional activation of these genes by CsWRKY23, dual-luciferase assay system was performed. The promoters of CsAAE12 , CsRbohD, CsSARD1, CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 were cloned into pGreenII 0800-LUC vector as reporters. CsWRKY23 was also constructed into pBD and pEAQ vectors as effectors. Following the previous description, the LUC/REN ratio was measured using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Cat No.11402, Yeason, Shanghai, China) at 2–3 d after co-transformation into tobacco leaves ( Wang et al., 2021 ). At least six independent repeats were set. 2.10 Determination of SA, H 2 O 2, lignin content and GST activity SA, H 2 O 2, lignin contents and GST activity in citrus fruit peel overexpressing CsWRKY23 were measured. The endogenous determination of SA content was performed according to previous reports with minor modifications ( Verberne et al., 2002; Yuan et al., 2016 ). Briefly, 1 g of citrus peel were used for the extraction of free and bound SA and the quantification was performed by high performance liquid chromatography using Shimadzu LC-20 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an ZORBAX Eclipse XDB C18 column (Agilent, CA, USA). The injection volume was 10 µL, and the flow rate was 0.8 mL min −1 at 40 °C. The mobile phase was sodium acetate buffer (50 mmol L −1 pH 5.4): methanol (9:1 v/v). SA detection wavelength was λ ex /λ em = 305 nm / 407 nm. The determination of H 2 O 2 and lignin content were carried out according to the previously reported method with minor modifications ( He et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2006 ). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was determined used an assay kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China), and it was calculated by measuring the rate of increase in absorbance at 340 nm. SA, H 2 O 2 , lignin contents and GST activity were expressed in fresh weight. 2.11 Data analysis The 2 − ΔΔCt method was used to analyze qRT-PCR results. Data were expressed as means ± standard errors (SEs). Figures were plotted and significance analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Students t -test or one way ANOVA were used for statistical analysis at P < 0.05 (*) or P < 0.01 (**). All primer sequences involved in this research are shown in the Table S1 . 3 Results 3.1 Identification and molecular characterization of CsWRKY23 In a previous study, the transcriptomes of citrus fruit infested with P. digitatum and citrus fruit infested with P. digitatum after SA soaking treatment were analyzed. CsWRKY23 (LOC102625492) was found to be significantly up-regulated in the transcriptome of only SA-pretreated fruit (log 2 fold change = 2.7) ( Deng et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2018 ), while, SA pretreated citrus fruit significantly improved the resistance to P. digitatum. RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of CsWRKY23 . As shown in Fig. 1 A, the expression of CsWRKY23 was significantly increased in citrus fruit infested with P. digitatum after SA pretreatment ( P < 0.05), its expression increased by about 2-fold. Based on the NCBI database, specific primers to clone CsWRKY23 were designed and its molecular characterization was analyzed. CsWRKY23 showed an open reading frame of 408 bp, encoding 135 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 15.57 kD and an isoelectric point of 8.82. CsWRKY23 coding sequence was fused to GFP and then transiently transformed for expression in tobacco leaves, and the subcellular localization of CsWRKY23 was inferred from the location of the GFP. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, pEAQ-CsWRKY25-GFP was localized only in the nucleus, whereas the control GFP signal was distributed in the nucleic acid as well as in the cytoplasm. Besides, sequence alignment of CsWRKY23 with multiple proteins (AtWRKY70, OsWRKY40, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY64) revealed that CsWRKY23 is a WRKY variant whose residues in WRKYGQK were replaced by WKKY motif ( Fig. 1 C), and where CsWRKY23 belongs to III WRKYs transcription factors group. 3.2 CsWRKY23 as a transcriptional activator The evaluation of transcriptional activation is important for TFs to activate downstream target genes. Yeast transformation system and dual-luciferase reporter system were used to evaluate the transcriptional activation activity of CsWRKY23. As shown in Fig. 1 D, CsWRKY23 can significantly activate the expression of LUC reporter genes, compared with a negative control (pBD). Meanwhile, the yeast transformation system showed that CsWRKY23 and the positive control yeast cells could be well grown in SD/−Trp − His − Ade medium with X-α-gal activity ( Fig. 1 E). 3.3 Transient overexpression of CsWRKY23 enhanced resistance to P. digitatum CsWRKY23 was transiently overexpressed into citrus peel to obtain more evidence of the molecular function. As shown in Fig. 2 A, RT-qPCR experiments were performed to detect transient overexpression of CsWRKY23 in citrus peel, being CsWRKY23 expression 56-fold higher compared to the control. The effect of CsWRKY23 overexpression on disease resistance in citrus fruit by using damage inoculation was also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2 B, C and D, the disease symptoms were significantly lower in OE23 group compared to the control ( P < 0.05). 3.4 Genome-wide identification of CsWRKY23-binding regions and motifs To further analyze the effect of CsWRKY23 on the regulatory network of citrus fruit disease resistance, DNA affinity purification (DAP) sequencing was used to identify the binding sites of CsWRKY23 on genomic-DNA. Based on the data obtained from the DAP-seq, 5434 peaks were identified ( Table S2 ), and according to the regional information of peaks on the genome and the annotation information of genes, the information of peak-related genes were obtained and the peak distributions in each functional region of the gene were calculated. CsWRKY23 DNA-binding site showed the highest distribution in the adjacent region of TSS ( Fig. 3 A), where 20.67 % of the DNA binding sites were located within the 2 kb region upstream of the TSS ( Fig. 3 B). This responds to the fact that CsWRKY23 is a typical TF with DNA binding ability and gene regulatory activity. MEME-chip in Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) program Suite was used to detect significant motif sequences in peak sequences. Results showed that the most significantly enriched motif sequence was “YGGTCAAC” (motif 1, E -value = 1.3 × e -621 ), the sequence of “GTCAA”, which is identical to that of the previously reported WRKY-binding W-box element. As a variant of the transcription factor, 3 additional significantly enriched motif sequences were also identified. The sequences were “CTTACTTGCCTTAGT” (motif 2, E -value = 1.2 × e -111 ), “TTAGCTGCTGGTCTT” (motif 3, E -value = 3.8 × e -65 ) and “GYCYRSTYCTG”(motif 4, E -value = 3.9 × e -25 ) ( Fig. 3 C). By counting the relative proportions of the four binding motifs distributed among the peak-related genes, it has been observed that motif 1 accounted for 56.79 %, while the remaining three motifs reached the 10–15 % ( Fig. 3 D). 3.5 Investigation and expression analysis of potential CsWRKY23 target gene To further clarify the expression of CsWRKY23-regulated genes, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of citrus peel that transiently overexpressed CsWRKY23 were performed. Genes with FDR < 0.05 and |log 2 fold change|>1 were screened as significantly differential genes. A total of 856 differentially expressed genes were obtained compared to the control group, where 389 genes were up-regulated, and 467 genes were down-regulated ( Fig. S1 ). DAP-Seq and RNA-Seq data were merged to determine the expression of CsWRKY23 directly regulated target genes. Peak genes of DAP-seq with the binding site in the 2 kb region upstream of the TSS after removal of repeats as potential target genes for CsWRKY23 were defined. As shown in Fig. 4 A, 29 genes were directly positively regulated by CsWRKY23 and 19 genes were inversely regulated by CsWRKY23. Based on RNA-seq results, a heat map of the expression of these target genes in each sample was developed ( Fig. 4 B) and it can be concluded that most of these genes are associated with plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, metabolic pathways, secondary metabolites biosynthesis and others metabolic pathways ( Fig. S2 ). 3.6 CsWRKY23 activate CsAAE12, CsRbohD, CsSARD1, CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 expression To further validate the transcriptional regulation of CsWRKY23 on these target genes and to resolve the regulatory role of CsWRKY23 in citrus fruit disease resistance response, the research has focused on up-regulated expression of target genes and selected five genes for EMSA assay. The promoter regions of CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 were analyzed, and it was determined to contain W-box elements (Text S1). As shown in Fig. 5 A, the CsWRKY23 recombinant protein could directly bind to the W-box of CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 promoter regions, resulting in distinct binding bands. Meanwhile, the shift bands disappeared as the concentration used for the cold probe increased and the concentration of the mutation probe (AAAA/TTTT) used does not affect the shift bands. In addition, a dual-luciferase report system to analyze the transcriptional activation of CsWRKY23 on these genes were constructed. Fig. 5 B shows that the presence of CsWRKY23 significantly increased the ratio of LUC to REN compared to the control (pEAQ), for the reporters constructed by CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 . These results illustrated that CsWRKY23 could specifically bind to the W-box of the promoters of these genes and act to activate their expression. 3.7 CsWRKY23 overexpression activate resistance response in citrus fruit The expression of the above five target genes ( CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 ) in overexpressed CsWRKY23 citrus peel using RT-qPCR were examined. As Fig. 6 shows, the expression of all these genes was significantly increased compared to the control. Furthermore, the content of downstream substances of some important target genes were analyzed ( Fig. 6 ). Firstly, the content of free and bound SA was measured, and the results showed that the content of bound SA was significantly higher than the control group, while the content of free SA did not change. Taken together, the total SA content was significantly raised compared to the control. In addition, since CsRbohD and CsGSTL3 were the direct target genes of CsWRKY23, the hydrogen peroxide content, lignin content and GST activity were measured. Results showed a significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the peel of citrus fruit overexpressing CsWRKY23 , which was manifested by an increase in hydrogen peroxide content. Meanwhile, GST enzyme activity was significantly increased, indicating the activation of antioxidant system. The accumulation of lignin indicates enhanced resistance of citrus peel to pathogenic fungi. Briefly, these data implied that CsWRKY23 improved disease resistance in citrus fruit by activating multiple pathways, such as SA metabolic pathway, reactive oxygen metabolism, etc. 4 Discussion WRKY transcription factor family is involved in the regulation of important plant stress responses. They are widely associated with the growth and development regulation and biotic or abiotic stress in plants. Functional WRKYs analysis have focused on some model crops, such as Arabidopsis , rice, and tomato ( Kim et al., 2006; Hsu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017 ). However, the function of WRKYs in non-model crops is still poorly investigated, especially in woody perennial species such as citrus. In addition, due to the differences between species, the regulatory patterns of homologous transcription factors in model crops do not correspond exactly to non-model crops. Therefore, it is important to investigate the mechanisms of WRKY transcription factor regulation of disease resistance response in citrus, which is considered an important agricultural product. In this study, CsWRKY23 in citrus fruit peel that could respond to exogenous SA induction were identified and cloned. This suggested that CsWRKY23 is involved in mediating the resistance of citrus fruit to P. digitatum . Multiple sequence analysis revealed that CsWRKY23 is a variant of WRKY TF localized in the nucleus ( Fig. 1 ). Although the structural domain of WRKY is generally highly conserved, it has been reported the substitution of WRKYGQK amino acid sequence in some species such as maize, banana, populus, mulberry, soybean and rice ( Eulgem et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017 ). WRKY can bind to the W-box of the promoter region of its target genes and to transcriptionally regulate the target genes expression ( Yamasaki et al., 2013 ). It has also been reported that the binding site of the variant WRKY TFs could be altered ( Van Verk et al., 2008 ). However, there are few reports about the binding site of WRKY TF with core sequence WKKY, and if it could bind to W-box and to other sites, it will require further identification. Firstly, yeast transformation system and dual-luciferase reporter system in tobacco leaves were used, and it has been demonstrated that CsWRKY23 is a transcriptional activator ( Fig. 1 ). These results suggested that CsWRKY23 could transcriptionally activate downstream disease resistance genes. To further clarify the molecular function of CsWRKY23, transient overexpression of CsWRKY23 in citrus peel revealed a significant increase in the resistance of citrus fruit to P. digitatum ( Fig. 2 ). To obtain more information about the process of CsWRKY23 in the regulation of disease resistance in citrus fruit, as well as to identify its binding sites and direct target genes, DAP-seq and RNA-seq were used for the analysis. Based on the results of DAP-seq, 5434 peaks were identified, and the DNA-binding site of CsWRKY23 showed the highest distribution in the adjacent region of TSS. Significantly enriched motifs were obtained using the MEME program Suite. Among them, motif 1 was the most abundant in the peak-related genes and its sequence was identical to the W-box commonly bound to WRKY TFs ( Fig. 3 ). This indicated that the variant CsWRKY23 has a general WRKY binding property and the ability to transcriptionally activate or repress target genes. In addition, RNA-seq was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes in CsWRKY23 overexpressed in citrus peel. Among them, 389 genes were up-regulated, and 467 genes were down-regulated. Also, it was observed that the expression of some potential CsWRKY23 target genes was not significantly changed, suggesting that these CsWRKY23 target genes might be involved in other developmental processes or expressed only under certain physiological conditions. By merging the data from DAP-seq and RNA-seq, 29 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated expressed genes were obtained ( Fig. 4 A). These 48 genes were considered as the direct regulatory target genes of CsWRKY23, suggesting that CsWRKY23 might act as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. In the present study, it was found that CsWRKY23 might be associated with genes of some metabolic pathways and transcriptionally repress the expression of these genes, such as lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides and other amino acids metabolisms. It is generally considered that the process of plant disease resistance is energy consuming and at the same time, plants may reduce its growth and development rates, increasing its resistance to diseases ( Jing et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, it was believed that PTI6 promote the expression of disease-related genes ( Wang et al., 2021 ), however, results showed that it is regulated by transcriptional repression of CsWRKY23. It could be due to the plant disease resistance response is a complex regulatory network in which multiple genes are involved in the coordination of each other, and protein modifications of transcription factors also influence the disease resistance response. The analysis of the interrelationship of individual genes and proteins is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of the disease resistance process in fruits. Up-regulated expression of target genes of CsWRKY23 were further analyzed. Results showed that several of these genes were directly associated with plant disease resistance, and five of them ( CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 ) were selected for validation. Up-regulated expression of RbohD genes may lead the accumulation of ROS, which is essential in the defense system of plants ( Camejo et al., 2016; Segal and Wilson, 2018 ). GST is an important detoxification enzyme that scavenges H 2 O 2 , which is essential for the balance with the oxidative stress in plants. CsWRKY22 in sweet orange could enhance the susceptibility to canker ( Long et al., 2021 ). SARD1 is a key regulator of the induction of SA synthesis. In Arabidopsis , AtWRKY70 promotes SARD1 expression and thus, SA production ( Zhou et al., 2018 ). IQM6 belongs to calmodulin-binding family protein, and it is presumed to be associated with cell wall strengthening. AAE12 encodes an acyl-activating enzyme, which is considered to be an important enzyme in the benzene propane biosynthetic pathway ( Colquhoun et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, EMSA and dual-luciferase reporter system were used, and the results showed that CsWRKY23 could specifically bind to the W-box of the promoters of these genes and activate their expression ( Fig. 5 ). Gene expression levels, H 2 O 2 content, lignin content and GST activity enzyme activity content in overexpressed CsWRKY23 citrus peel were also studied. Results showed that the overexpression of CsWRKY23 caused up-regulation of CsAAE12 , CsRbohD , CsSARD1 , CsWRKY22 and CsIQM6 , elevation of endogenous SA content, accumulation of H 2 O 2 and enhancement of GST enzyme activity. Lignin, a major component of plant cell walls, particularly important in the defense against pathogens, was also identified with increased content ( Fig. 6 ). As a corresponding SA-inducible transcription factor CsWRKY23, which in turn promoted the synthesis of endogenous SA content, which was essential for the establishment of citrus disease resistance ( Miura and Tada, 2014 ). Chen et al. suggested that SA promotes the accumulation of H 2 O 2 content in plants ( Chen et al., 1993 ), which leads to an increase in plant systemic resistance. The elevated GST enzyme activity reduces the excessive oxidative stress on citrus cells, which is a very important detoxification mechanism. The above evidence confirm that CsWRKY23 regulate multiple pathways to promote disease resistance in citrus fruit. 5 Conclusion No efficient and stable transgenic system has been established, so there are limitations to investigate the functions of important genes and proteins in citrus fruits. Our research elucidated the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of CsWRKY23 as an exogenous SA-induced variant WRKY involved in fruit disease resistance, which involves critical responses including the SA synthesis pathway, ROS accumulation, and cell wall strengthening. Results implied that the coordination of multiple pathways contributed to the increased the resistance of citrus fruits diseases affected with P. digitatum. Moreover, resistance enhancement is the coordination of multiple pathways, which is extremely complex. Protein interactions and protein modifications also play important roles in the fruit disease resistance response, and it requires further research to elucidate. This study provides new information on the mechanisms related to the WRKY involvement in disease resistance in citrus sinensis fruits.
