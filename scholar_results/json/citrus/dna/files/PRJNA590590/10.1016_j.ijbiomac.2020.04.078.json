    "full_text": "There is ongoing quest to look for alternate sustainable and renewable biopolymers which can address the existing environmental issues. Bacterial cellulose could be one such option. Several organisms have been reported to produce bacterial cellulose. Among this, acetic acid bacteria (AAB) are reported to be one of the major producers of bacterial cellulose. Recently, we have identified an Acetobacter pasteurianus RSV-4 and reported to produce high tensile strength bacterial cellulose. In order to globally understand its genetic structure, a draft genome sequence of Acetobacter pasteurianus RSV-4 was performed in the present study. The assembled genome had 101 contigs contributing to a total length of 3.8 Mbp. Predicted coding DNA sequences were 3311, of which approximately 70% were assigned the functions. Genome level phylogenetic analysis revealed that RSV-4 belongs to A. pasteurianus . Glycolysis was found to be incomplete in the genome analysis of RSV-4, while the genes/enzymes involved in pentose-phosphate pathway were present. The final draft genome sequence lacked bacterial cellulose synthase ( bcs ) operon. However, the presence of operon was evident in raw genomic sequences by Sanger sequencing. Therefore, presence of bcs operon in Acetobacter pasteurianus RSV-4 has documented its potential for bacterial cellulose production."

          "Cellulose is one of the most abundant natural polymer on earth [ 1–3 ]. Several products made up of cellulose are encountered by us such as paper, cotton t-shirt, wooden chair and table [ 4 ]. Properties like extreme stability, ability to resist harsh treatments and tensile strength make it a desirable biopolymer to manufacture several such products [ 4 , 5 ]. Generally, cellulose is derived from plants. However, there is growing demand for renewable and sustainable biopolymers which can address several environmental issues [ 6 ]. Bacterial cellulose (BC) could be a sustainable alternate to plant cellulose as it is renewable and biodegradable polymer [ 7 , 8 ]. It has many advantages over plant cellulose due to its crystallinity, degree of polymerization, high purity, tensile strength, water content, mechanical stability and biological adaptability [ 2 , 7–9 ]. As the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered it as generally recognized as safe (GRAS), it holds immense potential in different applications within biomedical, cosmetics and food sector [ 7 , 10 , 11 ]. It is often regarded as a conducive and efficient way to produce recyclable biopolymers that could be used in wound-dressing/biomedical needs and in various emerging nanotechnologies having industrial importance [ 10 , 12–16 ]. These include production of high quality papers, fluorescent paper, optically transparent films, and stabilizers for emulsions and foams [ 17 , 18 ]. Bacterial cellulose networks could also be used as artificial skin and medical pads. In cosmetic industry, it could be used in facial mask creams and facial scrubs products as an ingredient along with other natural materials [ 19–21 ]. The ability to acquire flavors, colors and the fact that it is approved by FDA could prove beneficial in manufacturing dietary products. Commercial products such as Kombucha tea and nata de coco, are few examples where bacterial cellulose has been utilized and widely accepted by people [ 22 , 23 ]. Considering its wide applicability and increasing demand, the market for bacterial cellulose by 2023 is expected to surpass 500 million US dollars [ 7 ]. In view of this, there is a need to bridge the existing gap between the knowledge generated in research laboratories and industrial scale-up in order to meet this projected/forecasted demand.",
          "Bacterial cellulose is a naturally occurring biopolymer and produced by some bacteria as a self-defense mechanism in the form of exopolysaccharide [ 22 ]. Various bacteria including model organisms Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteric , few plant pathogens Dickeyadadantii , Erwiniachrysanthemi , tumor-producing Agrobacterium tumefaciens , soil bacteria Burkholderia spp. and Pseudomonas putida and acetic acid bacteria have been reported to produce bacterial cellulose [ 4 ]. Among acetic acid bacteria (AAB), different genera have been reported as BC producers including Acetobacter , Gluconacetobacter and Kamagataeibacter [ 7 ]. Species of Gluconacetobacter , formerly known by the name of Acetobacter and and recently renamed to Kamagataeibacter , have been intensively studied for bacterial cellulose biosynthesis and are considered as a model organism [ 4 , 7 ]. Despite the huge diversity in organisms producing BC, the basic biosynthesis mechanism remains conserved. Biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose is a regulated process which involves various individual enzymes for directing the metabolite influx towards its biosynthesis, catalytic complexes for BC biosynthesis and regulatory proteins in series of multi-step reactions [ 18 , 22 ]. However, the yield and properties of BC are governed by several factors, including the choice of bacterial strain used, composition of culture media and conditions applied during the process [ 9 ]. The main issues with BC production arise from the choice of the microbial organism and their cultivation conditions [ 3 , 24 ]. Various studies have been conducted aiming towards selecting robust wild strains as well as engineered strains and to understand the mechanism behind bacterial cellulose biosynthesis. However, these studies mainly focus on Kamagataeibacter species [ 1 , 12 , 16 , 25–28 ]. Another important aspect is the raw materials for BC production. Several studies have been performed to search for an alternative cheap nutrient media which could bring down the overall production cost and at the same time provide a sustainable option [ 2 , 29–35 ]. For this, various food industry by-products have been proposed to substitute the expensive Hestrin and Schramm (HS) conventional medium [ 2 ]. Recently, our group had reported an efficient and economic process for the production of BC by a new strain of Acetobacter pasteurianus RSV-4 using biowaste from food industry as carbon source [ 3 , 6 ]. Development of genetically engineered strains is also a potential strategy to enhance the BC production, its yield and to improve its structural features [ 22 ]. In this regard, availability of genetic information and thorough understanding of the biosynthetic process could be useful. Recently, we had also reported the advantage of A. pasteurianus RSV-4 strain in bacterial cellulose production over other such strains [ 36 ]. In order to understand the holistic characteristics of A. pasteurianus RSV-4, its whole genome was sequenced in this study. Here, we present the draft genome sequence of RSV-4, a high BC producing strain with a special focus on the predicted genes that might be involved in BC biosynthesis. Genomic information of RSV-4 obtained in this study would provide valuable insight for improving and understanding the process of bacterial cellulose production and designing a cost effective process."

              "Special attention was given to ascertain taxonomy to RSV-4 considering its usefulness in bacterial cellulose production. Whole genome and the genetic structure have not been documented for earlier reported A. pasteurianus strains with particular emphasis on cellulose production. Partial bacterial cellulose synthase genes have been reported in few strains of A. pasteurianus (Ap8 cellulose synthase: AIX47793.1, Ap4 cellulose synthase ( bcsA ) gene:AIX47792.1) and few species of Acetobacter genus ( Acetobacter sp. KACC 21233:QEO16370.1, Acetobacter cerevisiae strain Ac2 cellulose synthase ( bcsA ):AIX47791.1, Acetobacter orientalis FAN1 DNA:BBC80812.1, Acetobacter peroxydans strain LMG 1635 cellulose synthase:AIX47788.1, Acetobacter syzygii strain LMG 21419 cellulose synthase ( bcsA ):AIX47787.1). There are several reports on bacterial cellulose biosynthesis in Acetobacter xylinus , but recently it has been placed in Kamagataeibacter genus [ 48 , 49 ], leaving no reference strain documented to produce bacterial cellulose in Acetobacter genus. Hence it was utmost important to ascertain the genus of RSV-4 and its taxonomic placement. Initial 16S rDNA sequencing data showed that RSV-4 belongs to A. pasteurianus species. To establish the taxonomy of RSV-4 in Acetobacteraceae , ANI score was calculated. ANI score cutoff >95% indicates that the subjected organism belongs to same taxon at species level. Since it is not 100% similar, hence suggested for a different strain [ 50 ]. An ANI score of 98.74 was obtained for RSV-4 when aligned with A. pasteurianus 386B strain ( Table 2 ). However, ANI is based on average values of homologous genomic regions, without considering the length or number of alignments correction [ 51 ]. Therefore, genome to genome distances (GGD) based on DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) analysis by in-silico genome to genome comparisons was performed with various Acetobacter species [ 45 ]. This technique compares genomic DNA from two species and percent similarity is assessed. A DDH score of 76.5 was obtained while comparing RSV-4 genome with A. pasteurianus pointing towards its placement in Acetobacter and in particular with A. pasteurianus . 16S rDNA sequencing data based phylogenetic analysis had also placed RSV-4 in A. pasteurianus species. To perform a more accurate phylogenetic classification, whole genome based phylogenetic analysis was performed. Both 16S rDNA based phylogenetic and genome wide phylogenetic analysis of RSV-4 with typed strain revealed that RSV-4 forms a distinct clade with A. pasteurianus typed strains, indicating that RSV-4 indeed belongs to A. pasteurianus ( Fig. 3 ). Taken together, these studies confirmed its placement in Acetobacter pasteurianus ."

              "Carbohydrates must pass through two membranes in gram negative bacteria before entering the cytosol where they are further utilized [ 52 ]. Porins are responsible for forming channels in the outer membrane to transport carbohydrates [ 52 ]. Five putative protein encoding genes were predicted to encode for carbohydrate porins ( OprB ), two putative protein encoding genes coding for porins and phosphate porin each in RSV-4 genome ( Table 3 ). The number of oprB gene copies is dependent on genome. A. pasteurianus strains 386B and SRCM101468 are reported to have seven copies of this gene, while Ab3 and SRCM101342 strains contain five copies similar to what is predicted in RSV-4 genome. High number of oprB genes may point towards their function in carbohydrate transport. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), diffusion facilitators, or ATP-driven ABC transporters and transporters dependent on proton or cation gradient are reported to play important role in the transportation of carbohydrates through cytoplamsic membrane in bacteria. Gene annotation analysis of RSV-4 genome revealed the presence of various transporters for the uptake of carbohydrates and other substrates. A total of 64 ABC transporters, 10 transporters, 15 permeases and 4 symporter genes were predicted in the draft genome of RSV-4. 25 genes were also predicted for phosphotransferase system which could be responsible for the transportation and phosphorylation of sugars such as glucose and fructose. Two homolog of glucose/galactosepermease ( peg.193 and peg.2509 ) were predicted in RSV-4 genome. Interestingly, gene coding for glucokinase ( gk ) responsible for the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate was not predicted in RSV-4 suggesting that glucose might be phosphorylated during transport through inner membrane and not in the cytosol. It was found that the genomes of all A. pasteurianus strains considered in this study lacked glucokinase contrary to the Komagataeibacter genomes where glucokinase involved in glucose phosphorylation in the cytosol [ 48 , 49 ]. Apart from this, gene encoding for phosphofructokinase was also not predicted in the draft genome of RSV-4 pointing towards its inability to metabolize glucose anaerobically. Gene encoding for all the other enzymes of Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway were present indicating incomplete glycolysis. Presence of all the genes encoding enzymes involved in pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) indicates that degradation of glucose is performed by this pathway, as reported earlier in A. pasteurianus IFO 3283 and A. aceti NBRC 14818 ( Fig. 4 ). Enzymes involved in uptake of glycerol were also predicted in RSV-4. Gene encoding for glycerol kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol uptake facilitator protein, glycerol-3-phosphate regulon repressor (GlpR) were also predicted in the genome of RSV-4. This has demonstrated the ability of the strain to take up glycerol from the environment and use it as an energy source [ 24 , 27 ]. Gene encoding for enzymes involved in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OPP pathway were also predicted in the genome of A. pasteurianus RSV-4 ( Fig. 4 )."

              "Extracellular polysaccharides such as cellulose and biofilms are synthesized and secreted by a conserved mechanism [ 53 ]. The first committed step in bacterial cellulose production is conversion of glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) to glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) by phosphoglucomutase ( pgm , EC 5.4.2.2). Once the metabolic flux is diverted towards cellulose production, glucose-1-phosphate is then converted into uridine-5′-disphosphate-α- d -glucose (UDP-glucose) in a rate limiting step by UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase ( GalU , EC 2.7.7.9). Finally, glycosyl residues from UDP-glucose are transferred to the nascent β-D-1,4-glucan chain by membrane bound bacterial cellulose synthase ( bcs ) [ 4 ]. This process and the machinery involved in it are thought to be conserved in all cellulose producing bacteria. Keeping this in mind, homologs of phosphoglucomutase ( pgm ) and UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase ( GalU ) were searched in the draft genome of RSV-4. Protein encoding genes, peg 1434 and peg 713 were predicted to encode phosphoglucomutase (555 aa) and UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase (296 aa) in RSV-4 genome. Identity of 99.82% with Acetobacter pasteurianus phosphoglucomutase (WP_003630929.1) and 100% with Acetobacter UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (WP_003623457.1) was observed for peg 1434 and peg 713 , respectively. Homologs of these two enzymes have also been reported in other strains of Acetobacter pasteurianus such as IFO 3283-01, NBRC 101655, 386B, Ab3, SRCM101342, SRCM101468, LMG 1262 = NBRC 106471. Bacterial cellulose synthase, a membrane protein complex is explicitly present in the cellulose synthetic pathway and is formed by a series of subunits like bcsA, bcsB, bcsC and bcsD [ 7 ]. In this, bcsA and bcsB represent the catalytic core of CS ( Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, the homologs for these genes were not predicted in the draft genome of RSV-4 or any other strain of A. pasteurianus . It could be due to the fact that other strains of A. pasteurianus that were used in this study for comparison might not be producing bacterial cellulose at all. However, RSV-4 has been found to produce bacterial cellulose with high tensile strength ( Fig. 6 ). Our recent study has reported a process for production of bacterial cellulose with RSV-4 on different substrates [ 36 ]. This has encouraged us to investigate the raw genomic sequences more critically. To our surprise, we found homolog of these genes in the sequences/contigs with low depth coverage, which were discarded by the software while assembling high quality genome. Further investigation, suggested that these genes are rich in GC content ( cmcAx : 60%, ccpAx : 64%, bcsA : 58%, bcsB : 63%, bcsC : 64%, bcsD : 60%, bglxA : 65%) and therefore might not be easily/readily available for sequencing. Hence, they were in low depth coverage. However, the contigs which showed homology had very less low query coverage but considerable identity (>85%).",
              "Since only partial sequence of bcsA was available in Acetobacter genus, bcs operon of Komagataeibacter xylinus E25 (previously placed in Acetobacter genus) was considered as reference for comparison. K. xylinus primary bcs operon (13 kbp long) belongs to type I and consists of seven genes ( cmcAx , ccpAx , bcsA , bcsB , bcsC , bcsD , bglxA ). This type of operon is hypothesized to be functional in almost all AAB. Each of these gene sequences were searched in the raw genomic sequences, where raw assembly was made with no depth coverage filter. It was observed that core catalytic genes, bcsA homolog showed 93.12% identity with 44% query coverage while bcsB homolog showed 87.11% identity with 22% query coverage. The maximum identity observed was for bcsC gene (96.07%) while the maximum query coverage along with considerable identity was for bcsD . The bcsD is a distinguishing feature of the type I of bcs operons which are found in certain members of alpha, beta and gamma subdivisions of Proteobacteria [ 4 ]. Presence of bcsD in RSV-4, along with other genes homolog has pointed towards the possibility of type I bcs operon functional in RSV-4. As the predicted contigs corresponded to partial sequences, so it was difficult to decipher their orientation in operon ( Fig. 7 ). Therefore, to further strengthen this hypothesis and to fish out whole bcs operon along with correct placement that might be present in RSV-4, Sanger sequencing was performed.",
              "Complete sequence of core catalytic putative gene bcsA was generated through Sanger sequencing and was observed for 93.34% identity with the reference bcsA gene of K. xylinus . RSV-4 bcsA gene was predicted to have transmembrane segments, similar to what was observed in the reference K. xylinus bcsA gene. Apart from this CelA domain, characteristic feature of bcsA was also predicted in the generated bcsA gene of RSV-4. The biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose is activated by c -di-GMP. Monomers and dimers of c -di-GMP are recognized by effector proteins via PilZ domains [ 54 , 55 ]. This domain contains an RXXXR motif in a flexible linker region and a DXSXXG motif in a β-sheet or β-barrel [ 53 ]. Other characteristic features of RSV-4 bcsA were also predicted in the form of sequence motifs RRKSR (RxxxR) and DVSMGG (D/NxSxxG). BcsB is a periplasmic protein and is believed to have a single C-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH) which anchors it to the cytoplasmic membrane [ 8 ]. C-terminal of bcsB is essential for the synthesis of cellulose as it anchors itself to the membrane and binds bcsB to the synthase protein [ 4 ]. RSV-4 putative bcsB generated sequence had 91.16% identity with the reference K. xylinus bcsB gene. Only one transmembrane domain was predicted in gene encoding putative bcsB . CDD analysis revealed the presence of bcsB domain, a characteristic feature of this catalytic subunit. The bcsC is only reported in bacteria synthesizing crystalline cellulose and not reported in bacteria producing non-crystalline cellulose [ 4 ]. Since RSV-4 produces crystalline cellulose, presence of bcsC is justified. It is believed that bcsC facilitates the transport of glucan chains outside the cell by forming a transmembrane pore. RSV-4 bcsC gene showed 92.53% identity with the reference K. xylinus bcsC gene and was also predicted for bcsC domain. The bcsD is a soluble protein present in the periplasmic space and might play critical role in crystallization of cellulose [ 56 ]. Sequence of putative bcsD had 100% query coverage and had 95.54% identity with reference K. xylinus bcsD gene. Similar to reference, Cellsynth_D domain was also predicted in this putative RSV-4 bcsD gene.",
              "Accessory protein cmcAx or bcsZ is either a part of or closely associated with bcsA -containing operon and is hypothesized to degrade individual glucan chains [ 4 ]. It encodes for a β-1,4-glucanase belonging to glycosyl hydrolases family 8 and contains a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence for periplasmic secretion [ 57 ]. Limited information is available about its biological function. It is still unknown whether it freely diffuses in the periplasm or interacts with bcsB or bcsC in order to degrade the mislocalized glucans. Predicted homolog of cmcAx in RSV-4 showed 91.34% identity with the reference K. xylinus cmcAx . bglX encodes for β-glucosidase and is proposed to participate in the hydrolysis of tangled β-D-glucan chains whenever there is a failure in chain arrangement, but their exact role in cellulose biosynthesis still remain obscure [ 4 , 48 , 49 , 58 ]. Putative bglX and ccpAx genes of RSV-4 showed 92.57% and 83.33% identity with the respective genes of reference K. xylinus. The ccpAx gene is assumed to help in cellulose production by effecting the expression levels of bcsB and bcsC , giving it name of cellulose-complementing protein A [ 58–60 ]. The interaction of ccpAx with bcsD was predicted to be assisting the formation of crystalline ribbons by arranging glucan chains. Biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose is regulated by a small molecular activator, c -di-GMP which is formed from two GTP molecules via enzymatic action. c -di-GMP is reported to bind to the PilZ domain of C-terminal cytosolic domain of bcsA subunit [ 61 ]. Cytosolic concentration of c -di-GMP is controlled by diguanylatecyclases and phosphodiesterases [ 61 ]. Homolgs for these enzymes were also predicted in the genome of RSV-4, pointing towards the operation of similar mechanism for the synthesis of bacterial cellulose in RSV-4."

    "full_text": "1 Introduction Cellulose is one of the most abundant natural polymer on earth [ 1–3 ]. Several products made up of cellulose are encountered by us such as paper, cotton t-shirt, wooden chair and table [ 4 ]. Properties like extreme stability, ability to resist harsh treatments and tensile strength make it a desirable biopolymer to manufacture several such products [ 4 , 5 ]. Generally, cellulose is derived from plants. However, there is growing demand for renewable and sustainable biopolymers which can address several environmental issues [ 6 ]. Bacterial cellulose (BC) could be a sustainable alternate to plant cellulose as it is renewable and biodegradable polymer [ 7 , 8 ]. It has many advantages over plant cellulose due to its crystallinity, degree of polymerization, high purity, tensile strength, water content, mechanical stability and biological adaptability [ 2 , 7–9 ]. As the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered it as generally recognized as safe (GRAS), it holds immense potential in different applications within biomedical, cosmetics and food sector [ 7 , 10 , 11 ]. It is often regarded as a conducive and efficient way to produce recyclable biopolymers that could be used in wound-dressing/biomedical needs and in various emerging nanotechnologies having industrial importance [ 10 , 12–16 ]. These include production of high quality papers, fluorescent paper, optically transparent films, and stabilizers for emulsions and foams [ 17 , 18 ]. Bacterial cellulose networks could also be used as artificial skin and medical pads. In cosmetic industry, it could be used in facial mask creams and facial scrubs products as an ingredient along with other natural materials [ 19–21 ]. The ability to acquire flavors, colors and the fact that it is approved by FDA could prove beneficial in manufacturing dietary products. Commercial products such as Kombucha tea and nata de coco, are few examples where bacterial cellulose has been utilized and widely accepted by people [ 22 , 23 ]. Considering its wide applicability and increasing demand, the market for bacterial cellulose by 2023 is expected to surpass 500 million US dollars [ 7 ]. In view of this, there is a need to bridge the existing gap between the knowledge generated in research laboratories and industrial scale-up in order to meet this projected/forecasted demand. Bacterial cellulose is a naturally occurring biopolymer and produced by some bacteria as a self-defense mechanism in the form of exopolysaccharide [ 22 ]. Various bacteria including model organisms Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteric , few plant pathogens Dickeyadadantii , Erwiniachrysanthemi , tumor-producing Agrobacterium tumefaciens , soil bacteria Burkholderia spp. and Pseudomonas putida and acetic acid bacteria have been reported to produce bacterial cellulose [ 4 ]. Among acetic acid bacteria (AAB), different genera have been reported as BC producers including Acetobacter , Gluconacetobacter and Kamagataeibacter [ 7 ]. Species of Gluconacetobacter , formerly known by the name of Acetobacter and and recently renamed to Kamagataeibacter , have been intensively studied for bacterial cellulose biosynthesis and are considered as a model organism [ 4 , 7 ]. Despite the huge diversity in organisms producing BC, the basic biosynthesis mechanism remains conserved. Biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose is a regulated process which involves various individual enzymes for directing the metabolite influx towards its biosynthesis, catalytic complexes for BC biosynthesis and regulatory proteins in series of multi-step reactions [ 18 , 22 ]. However, the yield and properties of BC are governed by several factors, including the choice of bacterial strain used, composition of culture media and conditions applied during the process [ 9 ]. The main issues with BC production arise from the choice of the microbial organism and their cultivation conditions [ 3 , 24 ]. Various studies have been conducted aiming towards selecting robust wild strains as well as engineered strains and to understand the mechanism behind bacterial cellulose biosynthesis. However, these studies mainly focus on Kamagataeibacter species [ 1 , 12 , 16 , 25–28 ]. Another important aspect is the raw materials for BC production. Several studies have been performed to search for an alternative cheap nutrient media which could bring down the overall production cost and at the same time provide a sustainable option [ 2 , 29–35 ]. For this, various food industry by-products have been proposed to substitute the expensive Hestrin and Schramm (HS) conventional medium [ 2 ]. Recently, our group had reported an efficient and economic process for the production of BC by a new strain of Acetobacter pasteurianus RSV-4 using biowaste from food industry as carbon source [ 3 , 6 ]. Development of genetically engineered strains is also a potential strategy to enhance the BC production, its yield and to improve its structural features [ 22 ]. In this regard, availability of genetic information and thorough understanding of the biosynthetic process could be useful. Recently, we had also reported the advantage of A. pasteurianus RSV-4 strain in bacterial cellulose production over other such strains [ 36 ]. In order to understand the holistic characteristics of A. pasteurianus RSV-4, its whole genome was sequenced in this study. Here, we present the draft genome sequence of RSV-4, a high BC producing strain with a special focus on the predicted genes that might be involved in BC biosynthesis. Genomic information of RSV-4 obtained in this study would provide valuable insight for improving and understanding the process of bacterial cellulose production and designing a cost effective process. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Bacterial strains and DNA extraction Acetobacter pasteurianus strain RSV-4 (MTCC 25117) was grown in HS (Hestrin-Shramm media % w/v: glucose 2.0; peptone 0.5; yeast extract 0.5; disodium phosphate 0.27; citric acid 0.115; pH adjusted to 6.0 with diluted HCl or NaOH) media and incubated at 30 °C without agitation. After 24 h, DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, FRITSCH GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) following manufacturer's instruction. Genomic DNA integrity was visualized on 1% agarose gel (w/v) containing 0.25 μg/μl of ethidium bromide (EtBr). Extracted genomic DNA yield (ng) and purity (absorbance ratio at 260/280) was determined spectrophotometrically using NanoDrop™One c Microvolume UV–Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, DE). 2.2 Genome sequencing and de novo genome assembly Whole genome of Acetobacter pasteurianus RSV-4 was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with paired-strategy 2 × 150 bp. The generated sequences are submitted in NCBI SRA SUB6547457/SRR10497819. Primary quality check was performed using fastp v0.19.7 [ 37 ]. Unicycler was used for de novo genome assembly using careful option and 10 kmer sizes 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127 [ 38 ]. The overall quality of assembled contigs sequences was evaluated using Quast v5.0.2. [ 39 ] and contigs having length lesser than 1 Kbp were discarded. Draft genome has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession JAACFP000000000. The resulted contigs were further used for genome annotation. Workflow adopted in this study is described in Fig. 1 . RAST Server was used for identification of putative coding regions and their functional annotation [ 40 ]. Cluster of orthologous groups (COG) were identified using EggNog-mapper based on eggNOG 4.5 orthology data [ 41 , 42 ]. Graphic illustrations of genome alignments were created using CGView [ 43 ]. 2.3 Taxonomic affiliation and phylogenetic analysis The 16S rDNA sequence was amplified using primers Forward: 5′ AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTAG 3′; and Reverse: 5′ ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACCT 3′ and the sequence similarity analysis were performed. 16S rDNA sequences of typed strains of acetic acid bacteria and cellulose producing bacteria from the family Acetobacterecae were downloaded from NCBI database and were aligned using Muscle aligner. A maximum likelyhood phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGAX with Tamura-Nei model, 500 replicates and gamma distribution option [ 44 ]. Genome based DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) were also performed to assign RSV-4 phylogeny. Genome sequences of typed strain bacteria from AAB were retrieved from NCBI for analysis. Genome wide DNA-DNA hybridization was done using GGDC 2.1 [ 45 ], while average nucleotide identity values were calculated using ANI Calculator from EZBioCloud [ 46 ]. Draft genome sequence of RSV-4 was uploaded to the Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS) for whole genome-based taxonomic analysis [ 47 ]. 2.4 Identification and characterization of Bacterial cellulose synthase (BCS) operon in Acetobacter pasteurianus RSV-4 For identification of bacterial cellulose synthase in RSV-4, K. xylinus E25 bcs operon sequences were searched in the assembled RSV-4 genome and in the unmapped reads of RSV-4 with low depth coverage. In order, to confirm predicted bcs operon sequences in RSV-4, gene specific primers were made for Sanger sequencing. List of primers used in the study are provided in Table S1 . Primers for each gene were standardized and PCR products obtained were subjected to Sanger sequencing. Resulted sequences were aligned and confirmed through homology search using BLAST [ 48 , 49 ]. All the resulting protein sequences were compared against protein databases performing blastp at NCBI.

A total of 2.1 Gb (~700 fold genome coverage) of reads were generated ( Table S2 ). A representative map depicting the predicted organization of RSV-4 genome with respect to reference genome of A. pasteurianus 386B strain is shown in Fig. 2 . A total of 101 contigs contributing to the length of 3.8 Mbp were predicted in the assembled RSV-4 genome. 17 contigs were ≥50 Kbp in size, N50 was 192 Kbp and L50 was 5. The observed G + C content was 52.5% and was very close to the median G + C content in sequenced genomes of A. pasteurianus strains (52.8%). A total of 3311 coding DNA sequences (CDS) were predicted. Summary of genome properties and statistics is represented in Fig. 2 . Approximately 70% of CDS were assigned to cluster of orthologous-group classification and functional categories (COG) ( Table 1 ). Putative functions were assigned to 2467genes ( Tables S3 and S4 ). A total of 55 transposases were predicted in RSV-4 genome. Individual alignment of 16S rDNA of 37 acetic acid bacteria (AAB) was manually checked and trimmed at the same length. From the concatenated sequences, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. RSV-4 formed a clade with other A. pasteurianus strains indicating that it belongs to Acetobacter genus and pasteurianus species.

From the concatenated sequences, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. RSV-4 formed a clade with other A. pasteurianus strains indicating that it belongs to Acetobacter genus and pasteurianus species. 3.2 Taxonomic placement, phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics Special attention was given to ascertain taxonomy to RSV-4 considering its usefulness in bacterial cellulose production. Whole genome and the genetic structure have not been documented for earlier reported A. pasteurianus strains with particular emphasis on cellulose production. Partial bacterial cellulose synthase genes have been reported in few strains of A. pasteurianus (Ap8 cellulose synthase: AIX47793.1, Ap4 cellulose synthase ( bcsA ) gene:AIX47792.1) and few species of Acetobacter genus ( Acetobacter sp. KACC 21233:QEO16370.1, Acetobacter cerevisiae strain Ac2 cellulose synthase ( bcsA ):AIX47791.1, Acetobacter orientalis FAN1 DNA:BBC80812.1, Acetobacter peroxydans strain LMG 1635 cellulose synthase:AIX47788.1, Acetobacter syzygii strain LMG 21419 cellulose synthase ( bcsA ):AIX47787.1). There are several reports on bacterial cellulose biosynthesis in Acetobacter xylinus , but recently it has been placed in Kamagataeibacter genus [ 48 , 49 ], leaving no reference strain documented to produce bacterial cellulose in Acetobacter genus. Hence it was utmost important to ascertain the genus of RSV-4 and its taxonomic placement. Initial 16S rDNA sequencing data showed that RSV-4 belongs to A. pasteurianus species. To establish the taxonomy of RSV-4 in Acetobacteraceae , ANI score was calculated. ANI score cutoff >95% indicates that the subjected organism belongs to same taxon at species level. Since it is not 100% similar, hence suggested for a different strain [ 50 ]. An ANI score of 98.74 was obtained for RSV-4 when aligned with A. pasteurianus 386B strain ( Table 2 ). However, ANI is based on average values of homologous genomic regions, without considering the length or number of alignments correction [ 51 ]. Therefore, genome to genome distances (GGD) based on DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) analysis by in-silico genome to genome comparisons was performed with various Acetobacter species [ 45 ]. This technique compares genomic DNA from two species and percent similarity is assessed. A DDH score of 76.5 was obtained while comparing RSV-4 genome with A. pasteurianus pointing towards its placement in Acetobacter and in particular with A. pasteurianus . 16S rDNA sequencing data based phylogenetic analysis had also placed RSV-4 in A. pasteurianus species. To perform a more accurate phylogenetic classification, whole genome based phylogenetic analysis was performed. Both 16S rDNA based phylogenetic and genome wide phylogenetic analysis of RSV-4 with typed strain revealed that RSV-4 forms a distinct clade with A. pasteurianus typed strains, indicating that RSV-4 indeed belongs to A. pasteurianus ( Fig. 3 ). Taken together, these studies confirmed its placement in Acetobacter pasteurianus . 3.3 Metabolic pathways Carbohydrates must pass through two membranes in gram negative bacteria before entering the cytosol where they are further utilized [ 52 ]. Porins are responsible for forming channels in the outer membrane to transport carbohydrates [ 52 ]. Five putative protein encoding genes were predicted to encode for carbohydrate porins ( OprB ), two putative protein encoding genes coding for porins and phosphate porin each in RSV-4 genome ( Table 3 ). The number of oprB gene copies is dependent on genome. A. pasteurianus strains 386B and SRCM101468 are reported to have seven copies of this gene, while Ab3 and SRCM101342 strains contain five copies similar to what is predicted in RSV-4 genome. High number of oprB genes may point towards their function in carbohydrate transport. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), diffusion facilitators, or ATP-driven ABC transporters and transporters dependent on proton or cation gradient are reported to play important role in the transportation of carbohydrates through cytoplamsic membrane in bacteria. Gene annotation analysis of RSV-4 genome revealed the presence of various transporters for the uptake of carbohydrates and other substrates. A total of 64 ABC transporters, 10 transporters, 15 permeases and 4 symporter genes were predicted in the draft genome of RSV-4. 25 genes were also predicted for phosphotransferase system which could be responsible for the transportation and phosphorylation of sugars such as glucose and fructose. Two homolog of glucose/galactosepermease ( peg.193 and peg.2509 ) were predicted in RSV-4 genome. Interestingly, gene coding for glucokinase ( gk ) responsible for the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate was not predicted in RSV-4 suggesting that glucose might be phosphorylated during transport through inner membrane and not in the cytosol. It was found that the genomes of all A. pasteurianus strains considered in this study lacked glucokinase contrary to the Komagataeibacter genomes where glucokinase involved in glucose phosphorylation in the cytosol [ 48 , 49 ]. Apart from this, gene encoding for phosphofructokinase was also not predicted in the draft genome of RSV-4 pointing towards its inability to metabolize glucose anaerobically. Gene encoding for all the other enzymes of Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway were present indicating incomplete glycolysis. Presence of all the genes encoding enzymes involved in pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) indicates that degradation of glucose is performed by this pathway, as reported earlier in A. pasteurianus IFO 3283 and A. aceti NBRC 14818 ( Fig. 4 ). Enzymes involved in uptake of glycerol were also predicted in RSV-4. Gene encoding for glycerol kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol uptake facilitator protein, glycerol-3-phosphate regulon repressor (GlpR) were also predicted in the genome of RSV-4. This has demonstrated the ability of the strain to take up glycerol from the environment and use it as an energy source [ 24 , 27 ]. Gene encoding for enzymes involved in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OPP pathway were also predicted in the genome of A. pasteurianus RSV-4 ( Fig. 4 ). 3.4 Bacterial cellulose production Extracellular polysaccharides such as cellulose and biofilms are synthesized and secreted by a conserved mechanism [ 53 ]. The first committed step in bacterial cellulose production is conversion of glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) to glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) by phosphoglucomutase ( pgm , EC 5.4.2.2). Once the metabolic flux is diverted towards cellulose production, glucose-1-phosphate is then converted into uridine-5′-disphosphate-α- d -glucose (UDP-glucose) in a rate limiting step by UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase ( GalU , EC 2.7.7.9). Finally, glycosyl residues from UDP-glucose are transferred to the nascent β-D-1,4-glucan chain by membrane bound bacterial cellulose synthase ( bcs ) [ 4 ]. This process and the machinery involved in it are thought to be conserved in all cellulose producing bacteria. Keeping this in mind, homologs of phosphoglucomutase ( pgm ) and UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase ( GalU ) were searched in the draft genome of RSV-4. Protein encoding genes, peg 1434 and peg 713 were predicted to encode phosphoglucomutase (555 aa) and UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase (296 aa) in RSV-4 genome. Identity of 99.82% with Acetobacter pasteurianus phosphoglucomutase (WP_003630929.1) and 100% with Acetobacter UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (WP_003623457.1) was observed for peg 1434 and peg 713 , respectively. Homologs of these two enzymes have also been reported in other strains of Acetobacter pasteurianus such as IFO 3283-01, NBRC 101655, 386B, Ab3, SRCM101342, SRCM101468, LMG 1262 = NBRC 106471. Bacterial cellulose synthase, a membrane protein complex is explicitly present in the cellulose synthetic pathway and is formed by a series of subunits like bcsA, bcsB, bcsC and bcsD [ 7 ]. In this, bcsA and bcsB represent the catalytic core of CS ( Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, the homologs for these genes were not predicted in the draft genome of RSV-4 or any other strain of A. pasteurianus . It could be due to the fact that other strains of A. pasteurianus that were used in this study for comparison might not be producing bacterial cellulose at all. However, RSV-4 has been found to produce bacterial cellulose with high tensile strength ( Fig. 6 ). Our recent study has reported a process for production of bacterial cellulose with RSV-4 on different substrates [ 36 ]. This has encouraged us to investigate the raw genomic sequences more critically. To our surprise, we found homolog of these genes in the sequences/contigs with low depth coverage, which were discarded by the software while assembling high quality genome. Further investigation, suggested that these genes are rich in GC content ( cmcAx : 60%, ccpAx : 64%, bcsA : 58%, bcsB : 63%, bcsC : 64%, bcsD : 60%, bglxA : 65%) and therefore might not be easily/readily available for sequencing. Hence, they were in low depth coverage. However, the contigs which showed homology had very less low query coverage but considerable identity (>85%). Since only partial sequence of bcsA was available in Acetobacter genus, bcs operon of Komagataeibacter xylinus E25 (previously placed in Acetobacter genus) was considered as reference for comparison. K. xylinus primary bcs operon (13 kbp long) belongs to type I and consists of seven genes ( cmcAx , ccpAx , bcsA , bcsB , bcsC , bcsD , bglxA ). This type of operon is hypothesized to be functional in almost all AAB. Each of these gene sequences were searched in the raw genomic sequences, where raw assembly was made with no depth coverage filter. It was observed that core catalytic genes, bcsA homolog showed 93.12% identity with 44% query coverage while bcsB homolog showed 87.11% identity with 22% query coverage. The maximum identity observed was for bcsC gene (96.07%) while the maximum query coverage along with considerable identity was for bcsD . The bcsD is a distinguishing feature of the type I of bcs operons which are found in certain members of alpha, beta and gamma subdivisions of Proteobacteria [ 4 ]. Presence of bcsD in RSV-4, along with other genes homolog has pointed towards the possibility of type I bcs operon functional in RSV-4. As the predicted contigs corresponded to partial sequences, so it was difficult to decipher their orientation in operon ( Fig. 7 ). Therefore, to further strengthen this hypothesis and to fish out whole bcs operon along with correct placement that might be present in RSV-4, Sanger sequencing was performed. Complete sequence of core catalytic putative gene bcsA was generated through Sanger sequencing and was observed for 93.34% identity with the reference bcsA gene of K. xylinus . RSV-4 bcsA gene was predicted to have transmembrane segments, similar to what was observed in the reference K. xylinus bcsA gene. Apart from this CelA domain, characteristic feature of bcsA was also predicted in the generated bcsA gene of RSV-4. The biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose is activated by c -di-GMP. Monomers and dimers of c -di-GMP are recognized by effector proteins via PilZ domains [ 54 , 55 ]. This domain contains an RXXXR motif in a flexible linker region and a DXSXXG motif in a β-sheet or β-barrel [ 53 ]. Other characteristic features of RSV-4 bcsA were also predicted in the form of sequence motifs RRKSR (RxxxR) and DVSMGG (D/NxSxxG). BcsB is a periplasmic protein and is believed to have a single C-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH) which anchors it to the cytoplasmic membrane [ 8 ]. C-terminal of bcsB is essential for the synthesis of cellulose as it anchors itself to the membrane and binds bcsB to the synthase protein [ 4 ]. RSV-4 putative bcsB generated sequence had 91.16% identity with the reference K. xylinus bcsB gene. Only one transmembrane domain was predicted in gene encoding putative bcsB . CDD analysis revealed the presence of bcsB domain, a characteristic feature of this catalytic subunit. The bcsC is only reported in bacteria synthesizing crystalline cellulose and not reported in bacteria producing non-crystalline cellulose [ 4 ]. Since RSV-4 produces crystalline cellulose, presence of bcsC is justified. It is believed that bcsC facilitates the transport of glucan chains outside the cell by forming a transmembrane pore. RSV-4 bcsC gene showed 92.53% identity with the reference K. xylinus bcsC gene and was also predicted for bcsC domain. The bcsD is a soluble protein present in the periplasmic space and might play critical role in crystallization of cellulose [ 56 ]. Sequence of putative bcsD had 100% query coverage and had 95.54% identity with reference K. xylinus bcsD gene. Similar to reference, Cellsynth_D domain was also predicted in this putative RSV-4 bcsD gene. Accessory protein cmcAx or bcsZ is either a part of or closely associated with bcsA -containing operon and is hypothesized to degrade individual glucan chains [ 4 ]. It encodes for a β-1,4-glucanase belonging to glycosyl hydrolases family 8 and contains a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence for periplasmic secretion [ 57 ]. Limited information is available about its biological function. It is still unknown whether it freely diffuses in the periplasm or interacts with bcsB or bcsC in order to degrade the mislocalized glucans. Predicted homolog of cmcAx in RSV-4 showed 91.34% identity with the reference K. xylinus cmcAx . bglX encodes for β-glucosidase and is proposed to participate in the hydrolysis of tangled β-D-glucan chains whenever there is a failure in chain arrangement, but their exact role in cellulose biosynthesis still remain obscure [ 4 , 48 , 49 , 58 ]. Putative bglX and ccpAx genes of RSV-4 showed 92.57% and 83.33% identity with the respective genes of reference K. xylinus. The ccpAx gene is assumed to help in cellulose production by effecting the expression levels of bcsB and bcsC , giving it name of cellulose-complementing protein A [ 58–60 ]. The interaction of ccpAx with bcsD was predicted to be assisting the formation of crystalline ribbons by arranging glucan chains. Biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose is regulated by a small molecular activator, c -di-GMP which is formed from two GTP molecules via enzymatic action. c -di-GMP is reported to bind to the PilZ domain of C-terminal cytosolic domain of bcsA subunit [ 61 ]. Cytosolic concentration of c -di-GMP is controlled by diguanylatecyclases and phosphodiesterases [ 61 ]. Homolgs for these enzymes were also predicted in the genome of RSV-4, pointing towards the operation of similar mechanism for the synthesis of bacterial cellulose in RSV-4. 4 Conclusions In summary, global insights about the genetic structure of bacterial cellulose producing A. pasteurianus strain RSV-4 has been provided along with genes that might be playing important role in cellulose synthesis.The assembled genome of 3.8Mbp had 101 contigs. The presence of bacterial cellulose synthase ( bcs ) operon has been characterized for the first time in the raw genomic sequencesof A. pasteurianus strain RSV-4 by Sanger sequencing. Presence of the bcs operon and key genes in Acetobacter pasteurianus RSV-4 could be responsible for its potential of bacterial cellulose production. The genetic information generated in this study is beneficial in engineering strain for more robust cellulose production and in designing of cost effective nutrient media.
